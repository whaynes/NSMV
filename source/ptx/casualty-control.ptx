  <title>Casualty Control</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>An engineering casualty occurs when a component, machine, or system aboard ship fails to serve the purpose for which it was installed. Casualties can usually be traced to a failure of a component of the engineering system or to operator error. While some casualties are insignificant or can be easily rectified, others can lead to catastrophic consequences if not attended to quickly and effectively. Engineering casualty control is concerned with the prevention, minimization, and correction of these casualties.</p>

      <p>It is important to understand that there are an infinite number of potential casualties, and that every casualty situation is unique. It is not possible to create a comprehensive step-by-step response to every possible casualty. Nevertheless, it is possible to state some general principles regarding casualty control, and to pre-plan for some common or critical potential casualties. Here are four principles to consider.</p>

      <p>It is important to understand that there are an infinite number of potential casualties, and that every casualty situation is unique. It is not possible to create a comprehensive step-by-step response to every possible casualty. Nevertheless, it is possible to state some general principles regarding casualty control, and to pre-plan for some common or critical potential casualties. Here are four principles to consider.</p>

      <title>It's better to prevent casualties than to respond to them</title>
      <p>Most casualties can be prevented by attention to proper watchstanding and maintenance. Take care of the small things before they become big things. Always maintain proper lubrication and cooling.  Test lubricating oil periodically for water and other contaminants. Keep regulating valves and control systems properly adjusted. Determine the cause of, and repair leaks as soon as they're found. Perform maintenance at the intervals recommended by the manufacturer. Remember that if one machine fails, similar units may have similar problems, so after the failure of one, check the others. And finally, don't cause casualties -- know the correct way to operate the equipment and do it that way.</p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Anticipate and prepare for casualties</title>
      <p>Surprisingly often, casualties can be predicted.  An alert engineer will notice slight changes in the operating temperatures and pressures over time, which can indicate failing pumps or fouled heat exchangers.  Failing bearings run hotter and noisier, and can easily be detected by touch or with vibration analysis.  Failing electrical insulation has a distinctive smell. Sometimes, the signs are not apparent; you just have a vague feeling that something is not right.  In any event, you should not ignore your hunches, but think through what they might mean and plan for them. You should continuously prepare for casualties before they occur by mentally reviewing potential situations, their consequences, and planning your responses.</p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>You can never have too much information</title>
      <p>A good engineer must have a thorough knowledge of the plant.  When you arrive onboard, trace out all major systems and learn the location of all critical valves, so that you can quickly locate and use them in an emergency.  You should particularly look for crossover valves that are not normally used, but which may become important for restoring service after a failure, and isolation valves for securing portions of piping systems.  You should also locate all available safety equipment, and the location of engineroom exits.</p>
      <p>You need to be thoroughly familiar with the normal operation of the plant. Without a knowledge of normal operating temperatures, pressures, noises, smells, vibrations, and familiarity with the way the system responds to changing loads, it is next to impossible for you to recognize the signs of impending trouble.  Most of this information can be obtained by good watchstanding -- making thorough rounds, remembering what you see, and reviewing the logbook for trends.  You can also refer to the ship's manuals and discuss normal operating conditions with the other engineers onboard.</p>
      <p>Finally, you should be completely comfortable with normal startup and shutdown procedures, because in many cases, the most appropriate response to a casualty is to quickly and safely start up a stand-by unit and secure the faulty one before things get worse.</p>
      <p>When a casualty occurs, you will need timely and accurate information.  The alarm and instruments on the console will probably be your first notification of a problem, so it is vitally important to keep them in good working order.  If a gage or thermometer gives any indication that is is faulty: sticking pointer, bogus readings, etc. it should be replaced, repaired, or re-calibrated without delay.  Console alarm points should be adjusted to minimize nuisance alarms.  Don't take anything for granted; always investigate every alarm on the board.  Don't become complacent and ignore alarms because "it was like that when I got here" or  "it always does that."</p>

      <title>Don't delay</title>
      <p>When a casualty does occur you must respond quickly.  Don't stand around waiting to see what will happen next.  Remember that the situation can spiral out of control quickly, and that the ship may be in congested or dangerous waters where loss of propulsion could endanger everyone aboard. Notify the bridge and the chief at the first sign of trouble, and take corrective action promptly. Don't be ashamed to call for more help if you need it; the safety of the vessel, personnel and machinery is in your hands, and it must be your primary consideration.</p>

    <title>Phases of Casualty Control</title>
    <paragraphs>
      <title/>
      <p>A plant that is functioning normally is pretty simple to operate <mdash/> as long as the engines have fuel and air the automation does the rest.  But when something goes wrong, the watch engineer needs to assess the situation quickly, and make an appropriate response without delay.  Keeping the lights on and the shaft turning is important, but  the safety of the crew and the vessel is primary.</p>
      <p>Although it may not seem like it when you are surrounded by alligators, casualty control can be broken into four phases.</p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Notification</title>
      <p>Most of time you will learn of a casualty from an alarm on the main console: low lube oil pressure, high salinity, low water, etc. However, some critical parameters are not alarmed, so while you're on watch you must continuously monitor main console gages like drum pressure, feed pressure, and condenser vacuum.  Good monitoring may also give you advanced notice of problems before the alarm sounds. Finally, some problems will only be found by making good rounds  <mdash/>  leaks, for example.</p>
      <p>It is important to correctly identify the root cause of the casualty.  The alarm you receive may only be a symptom of the true problem.</p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Immediate response</title>
      <p>As soon as you are aware of a problem, you should take action to minimize the casualty. Don't hesitate to sound the engineers' alarm to call for help. Attempt to prevent further damage to the unit concerned, by tripping or securing its power; and to prevent the casualty from spreading through secondary effects, but bear in mind the consequences of securing the equipment.  Notify the bridge and the chief as soon as practical.</p>

    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Recovery</title>
      <p>Next, regain stable plant status by restoring the services which were interrupted by the casualty.  This may involve starting stand-by units, crossing over systems, placing automation in hand mode, bypassing regulators, or operating at reduced capacity. Don't forget to establish support services such as cooling and lubrication for the newly started equipment.</p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Repair</title>
      <p>At the end of the recovery phase the plant will be stable, but may be in a vulnerable condition, with reduced capacity or redundancy. Therefore, any damaged equipment should be repaired as soon as possible, and the plant brought back to full operational status.   The chief will give the captain an estimate of how long it will take to make the plant fully operational, and do the paperwork  <mdash/>  fill out the logbook, casualty reports, and machinery histories.</p>
    </paragraphs>
    <paragraphs>
      <title>Analysis</title>
      <p>After the fact, you should determine the cause of the casualty and the lessons learned. What caused the problem? Was it wear, fatigue, inadequate lubrication, poor maintenance, faulty repairs, improper watch practice, or something else? What can be done to prevent further occurrences?  Better training, improved maintenance, redesign?</p>
