\f1\fs32 When installing a check valve, always remember: Check valves <em>must</em> be   installed in a manner that allows gravity to help close the disk. This way the valve   will close even if the flow reversal is only slight. Swing checks are normally installed   in piping systems with the cap up, and lift checks are installed with the disks closing   in the downward direction. There is usually a directional arrow on the valve body which   indicates the direction of fluid flow. \
