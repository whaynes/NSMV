\f1\fs28 You are expected to carry out routine operations without being specifically told to what to do, but direction can be found in the *standing orders*, and in the *night orders.* Standing orders and night orders may be formal written instructions, requiring the watch officer to read and sign, or they may be less formal, simply written on the engine room status board.  On some ships, instructions are verbally passed from watch to watch.
