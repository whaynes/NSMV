\f1\fs32 In a swing check valve the valve seat is angled 45\'b0 to the fluid flow path through the   valve. The disk is attached by an arm to a hinge pin inside the valve body near the   cover opening. The hinge pin is located just above the highest part of the seat opening.   When the fluid flow is from right to left and the pressure on the bottom of the disk is   greater than the pressure on the top of the disk, the disk swings away from the seat   allowing flow to take place. When fluid flow tries to reverse (from left to right), the   pressure on top of the disk becomes greater than the pressure on the bottom of the disk,   the disk to moves back toward the seat, preventing flow in this direction. The arm and   hinge pin assembly assure correct alignment between the disk and seat for a tight   closure. \
