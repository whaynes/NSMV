\f1\fs32 Absolute pressure is the numerical scale that starts at zero, where zero corresponds to the vacuum of space. Absolute value is elevation dependent, meaning absolute pressure increases the closer one gets to Earth, and continues to increase the further one travels towards Earth\'92s center. For example, absolute pressure at sea level is 14.7 psia. In Death Valley, which is below sea level, absolute pressure is 14.9 psia. The densities of different liquids will also affect absolute pressure, so the deeper an object is placed in fluid, the more pressure it will experience. Absolute pressure is always greater than the corresponding gauge pressure. \
For shipboard purposes if you are utilizing a gauge, you can simply add 14.7 psi to the gauge reading in psi to get the absolute pressure. For example, a gauge pressure of 100 psig would be the same as an absolute pressure of 114.7 psia.
