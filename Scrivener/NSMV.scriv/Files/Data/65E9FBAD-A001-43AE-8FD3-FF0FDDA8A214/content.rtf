\f0\fs28 \cf2 \CocoaLigature0 These gauges measure the liquid level based on displacement principles. A small displacer is accurately positioned within the liquid using a servo motor. The displacer is suspended by a measuring wire wound onto a finely grooved drum inside the instrument. The system continuously adjusts the position of the displacer, providing precise measurements of the liquid level. This method is known for its accuracy and reliability in various industrial applications.}
