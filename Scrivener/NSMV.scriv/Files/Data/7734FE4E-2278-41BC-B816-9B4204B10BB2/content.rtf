\f0\fs24 \cf0 <$Scr_Ps::0>
\f1\fs32 CFR 140.3 defines as sewage as, "human body wastes and the waste from toilet and other receptacles intended to receive or retain body waste." No matter how sewage may be defined in any other context, that is the complete definition of sewage as it pertains to marine sanitation. As such, sewage does not include garbage, trash, bath water, galley water, food, oil, gasoline or anything else. It is human body waste, period, and sewage is the only thing at issue in marine sanitation laws\'97except on the Great Lakes where gray water from commercial vessels must also be held.
