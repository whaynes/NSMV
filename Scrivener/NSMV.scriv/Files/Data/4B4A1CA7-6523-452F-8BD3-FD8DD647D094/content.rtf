\f1\fs32 When a casualty does occur you must respond quickly.  Don't stand around waiting to see what will happen next.  Remember that the situation can spiral out of control quickly, and that the ship may be in congested or dangerous waters where loss of propulsion could endanger everyone aboard. Notify the bridge and the chief at the first sign of trouble, and take corrective action promptly. Don't be ashamed to call for more help if you need it; the safety of the vessel, personnel and machinery is in your hands, and it must be your primary consideration.\
