The material chosen for a pipe depends on factors such as the fluid being transported, temperature and pressure conditions, corrosion considerations, cost, and regulatory requirements.\
1. **Carbon Steel:** Carbon steel pipes are widely used  due to their strength and cost-effectiveness. However, carbon steel is susceptible to corrosion in marine environments, so protective coatings or regular maintenance are necessary.\
4. **Nickel Alloys:** Nickel alloys, such as Monel and Inconel, are used in ship systems where resistance to high temperatures, corrosion, and stress is required. These alloys are often used in systems that handle harsh chemicals or high-temperature fluids.\
2. **Stainless Steel:** Stainless steel has excellent corrosion resistance. Different grades of stainless steel are used depending on the level of corrosion resistance required and the specific fluids being transported. \
3. **Copper:** Copper has good corrosion resistance and good heat transfer characteristics, so is suitable for some heat exchangers.\
7. **Brass:** Brass pipes are used in certain ship systems due to their corrosion resistance, especially in areas where saltwater exposure is frequent. They are commonly used in small-scale plumbing and valve systems.\
