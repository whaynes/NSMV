\f1\fs32 The most immediate and dangerous hazard of electricity is electrical shock. When a person comes into contact with an electrical voltage, current can pass through their body, causing electrical shock. \
Roughly speaking, the greater the current, the more severe the shock.  High voltage presents more danger than lower voltages, but even normal household voltage (120 V AC) can cause severe shock or even death.
