\f0\fs20\fsmilli10020 \cf2 Macerators are wet choppers for breaking up, homogenizing, and dispersing free-flowing liquid/solid preparations.  The chopping elements are the\
rotating impeller and the stationary cutting ring. The macerator's shaft is sealed by a maintenance-free, unbalanced, single-acting mechanical seal.\
\
The rotating impeller captures solids suspended in the liquid and accelerates the solids against the cutting ring. The solids are uniformly reduced in size between the impeller's milling cutters and the edges of the cutting ring. Narrow slots in the impeller and the gap between the cutting tools allow the chopped solids to enter the macerator casing's holding area together with the carrying liquid; from here macerators of the S construction type independently move the mixture further; macerators of the I construction type require a downstream pump.}
