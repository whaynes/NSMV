\f1\fs32 Pipe fittings are the parts used to join pipe sections together with other system components like valves and pumps to build complete piping systems.\
As discussed in <xref ref="pipe-connections"/>, pipe fittings may be welded,  threaded, mechanically joined, or chemically adhered, to name the most common mechanisms, depending on the material of the pipe.  Some of the most common pipe fittings are described in the following sections.  The photos show threaded iron fittings, but similar fittings are available for other materials and connection methods.
