\f1\fs32 Most casualties can be prevented by attention to proper watchstanding and maintenance. Take care of the small things before they become big things. Always maintain proper lubrication and cooling.  Test lubricating oil periodically for water and other contaminants. Keep regulating valves and control systems properly adjusted. Determine the cause of, and repair leaks as soon as they're found. Perform maintenance at the intervals recommended by the manufacturer. Remember that if one machine fails, similar units may have similar problems, so after the failure of one, check the others. And finally, don't cause casualties -- know the correct way to operate the equipment and do it that way.\
