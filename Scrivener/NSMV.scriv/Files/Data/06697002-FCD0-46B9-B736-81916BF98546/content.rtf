\f1\fs32 Many different units are used to describe pressure. The simplest pressure units are ones that indicate how much force is applied to an area of a certain size. These units include pounds per square inch, pounds per square foot, newtons per square meter.  Other pressure units such as  pascals, atmospheres, or, bars are defined in terms of the base units of force and area. In the US we most commonly use pounds per square inch (psi), but aboard the training ship bars are most common.\
