\f1\fs32 In construction, DC motors are similar to DC generators. The traditional advantage that DC motors have had over AC motors is that, unlike AC motors, their speed can be easily controlled over a wide range by a <term>rheostat</term>. A rheostat is an easily adjusted variable resistor that can be connected in series with the motor field windings to control field current and, therefore, motor speed. However, solid-state electronic controls like variable frequency converters are now available, allowing AC motors to be operated with variable speed. Consequently, few DC motors are found aboard modern ships.\
