\f1\fs32 An engineering casualty occurs when a component, machine, or system aboard ship fails to serve the purpose for which it was installed. Casualties can usually be traced to a failure of a component of the engineering system or to operator error. While some casualties are insignificant or can be easily rectified, others can lead to catastrophic consequences if not attended to quickly and effectively. Engineering casualty control is concerned with the prevention, minimization, and correction of these casualties.\
