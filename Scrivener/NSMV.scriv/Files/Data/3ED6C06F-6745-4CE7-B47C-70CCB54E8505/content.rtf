\f0\fs24 \cf0 <$Scr_Ps::0>
\f1\fs32 The second step in most publicly owned waste treatment systems, in which bacteria consume the organic parts of the waste. It is accomplished by bringing together waste, bacteria, and oxygen in trickling filters or in the activated sludge process. This treatment removes floating and settleable solids and about 90 percent of the oxygen demanding substances and suspended solids. Disinfection is the final stage of secondary treatment.
