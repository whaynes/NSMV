\f0\fs24 \cf0 <$Scr_Ps::0>
\f1\fs32 Frequently, engineers need to find length equivalents between different systems of measurement. For example, in the construction of a ship there may be different contractors, some of whom use US standard measurement and others who use metric. Since the agreed upon system is metric, conversions are required to standardize all measurements.

\f1\fs32  is the sequential application of conversion factors expressed as fractions and arranged so that any dimensional unit appearing in both the numerator and denominator of any of the fractions can be cancelled out until only the desired set of dimensional units is obtained. For example, 10 miles per hour (mi/hr or mph)\'a0can be converted to meters per second (m/s) by using a sequence of conversion factors as shown below:
