\f1\fs32 Mechanical provisions are made inside the tank so that the quantity of a tank can directly be read through a level marker, an indicator, or a float level sensor. In the tank a float can be attached to a pointer through a pulley. As the level varies, the pointer reading will change accordingly. A level gauge glass is also attached to the tank to read the quantity of the fluid inside the tank. The gauge may also be a pneumatic/hydraulic operated gauge or differential pressure gauge.
