\f0\fs24 \cf0 <$Scr_Ps::0>
\f1\fs32 Improved efficiency at low loads. Ships can secure one or more engine/generator sets if they are not needed. The remaining engines can then operate at nearly full load, resulting in improved efficiency compared to having more engines operating at part-load. Load management systems continuously monitor the electrical demand and promptly initiate the startup of an additional generator when necessary.
