\f0\fs24 \cf0 <$Scr_Ps::0>
\f1\fs32 Traditionally aboard ships, the ship's bell is struck every half-hour to mark the passage of time during the watch.  The day is divided into six, four-hour watches, beginning at midnight.  The bell strikes once at the first half-hour, twice at the hour, and increases by one strike every half-hour until eight bells, which marks the end of one watch and the beginning of the next.  \
