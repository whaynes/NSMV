\f1\fs32 Whenever there is a flame in the boiler, there must be steam flow through the superheater. Without this steam flow, the superheater tubes will overheat and burn out. Insuring steam flow through the superheater is not a problem when the boiler is operating on the line, since the normal flow to the turbine and auxiliaries provides sufficient flow, but it is significant during the boiler warm up period and during boiler casualties. At these times, it is critical to open the <em>superheater vent valve</em> located on the superheater outlet. Opening this valve permits a small amount of steam to flow up the smokestack and provide sufficient cooling to protect the superheater. \
