\f0\fs28 \cf2 \CocoaLigature0 Pipe thread standards are standardized specifications that define the characteristics of threaded connections used in pipes and pipe fittings. These standards ensure compatibility and interchangeability between different components in piping systems. There are several pipe thread standards used around the world, each with its own characteristics and applications. Here are some of the most common pipe thread standards:\
\
\
1. **NPT (National Pipe Thread):**\
   - NPT is a widely used thread standard in the United States and Canada.\
   - There are two main types: NPT (Tapered) and NPTF (Dryseal).\
   - NPT threads are tapered, which helps create a seal by wedging the threads together as the fittings are tightened.\
   - NPTF threads have modified shapes to improve sealing without the need for thread sealants.\
\
2. **BSPT (British Standard Pipe Thread):**\
   - BSPT is a common thread standard in the United Kingdom and many countries that were part of the British Empire.\
   - BSPT threads are also tapered, like NPT threads.\
   - Common types include BSPT (Tapered) and BSPP (Parallel or Straight).\
\
3. **BSPP (British Standard Pipe Parallel):**\
   - BSPP threads are parallel or straight threads used in conjunction with BSPT threads.\
   - BSPP threads do not create a tight seal without the use of additional sealing methods.\
\
4. **BSPF (British Standard Pipe Fitting):**\
   - BSPF threads are used in specialized fittings and require the use of a sealing washer to create a seal.\
\
5. **Metric Thread Standards:**\
   - ISO 7-1 (BSP) and ISO 228-1 (BSPT) are metric thread standards used in various countries.\
   - These standards are commonly used in Europe and other regions where the metric system is prevalent.\
\
6. **G (German) Thread Standard:**\
   - The DIN 3852-1 standard defines the G thread, which is a parallel thread used in Germany and some other European countries.\
\
7. **JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) Thread:**\
   - JIS threads are used in Japan and other countries that follow Japanese industrial standards.\
   - These threads are often found in specialized applications and components.\
\
8. **UN/UNF Thread Standards:**\
   - Unified National (UN) and Unified National Fine (UNF) thread standards are widely used in the United States for various applications, including pipes and fittings.\
\
9. **API (American Petroleum Institute) Thread Standards:**\
   - API thread standards, such as API 5B and API 5C, are used specifically in the petroleum industry for oil and gas pipes and equipment.\
\
It's important to choose the correct thread standard for your application to ensure proper fit, sealing, and functionality of the piping system. Mismatched threads can lead to leaks, inefficiencies, and other issues. Always refer to relevant standards and guidelines when selecting and using pipe threads and fittings.}
