1. Voltage Regulation: The excitation system adjusts the generator's field current to maintain a steady voltage output, typically at a specified set point. This ensures that the generator can provide a constant and stable supply of electrical power.\
\
2. Reactive Power Control: The excitation system controls the generator's reactive power output. Reactive power is required to maintain voltage stability in power systems and is important for reactive power compensation and voltage control in transmission and distribution networks.\
\
3. System Stability: The excitation system plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the power system. It helps to dampen system oscillations and supports the overall stability of the interconnected grid by adjusting the generator's excitation level in response to changes in system conditions.\
\
4. Fault Ride-Through Capability: In the event of a fault or disturbance in the power system, the excitation system can provide additional field current to the generator to enhance its ability to ride through the fault without tripping offline.\
\
5. Synchronization: The excitation system assists in synchronizing the generator with the rest of the power system. It ensures that the generator's output voltage matches the system voltage during the connection process, allowing for smooth and seamless integration of the generator into the grid.\
