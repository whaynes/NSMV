\f1\fs32 The economizer is a finned tube heat exchanger located in the gas path beyond the tube bank at the base of the exhaust stack. Combustion gases flow across the economizer tubes while feedwater flows through the tubes. The gases give up some of their remaining energy to heat the incoming feedwater before passing out the stack. \
