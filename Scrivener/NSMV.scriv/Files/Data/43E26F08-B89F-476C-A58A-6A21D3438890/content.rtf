\f1\fs32 Eliminating the need for reduction gears. Typically, diesel engines and steam turbines operate most efficiently at high or medium speeds, while propellors are most efficient at low speed, below about 100 RPM.  When propulsion power is supplied electrically, speed reduction is accomplished by selecting the appropriate number of poles in the generator and varying the electrical frequency supplied to the motor. This setup allows each component to operate within its most efficient range, maximizing overall energy efficiency and reducing fuel consumption.
