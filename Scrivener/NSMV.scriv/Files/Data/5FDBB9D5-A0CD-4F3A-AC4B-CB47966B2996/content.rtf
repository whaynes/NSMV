\f1\fs32 The entire boiler is surrounded by a two-layered casing which provides an airtight enclosure for the boiler, see <xref ref="refractory_png"/>. Air from the forced draft blowers flows between the two casings. Both the inner and outer casings of the boiler are made of steel panels. The panels are removable to provide access to the boiler tubes for inspection or repair, and are welded or bolted together with gaskets to form an airtight seal. \
