\f1\fs32 There are two basic systems utilized today for measurement, the US Standard and the SI, or International System. The unit of measurement used depends upon what System(s) are involved, and therefore Conversion factors are used to go between systems. We have seen this in the chapter sections on length, area, volume, and time. In terms of measuring pressure, the US System uses psi or pounds per square inch. The International System uses newtons per centimeter squared, or kilopascals (kPa).
