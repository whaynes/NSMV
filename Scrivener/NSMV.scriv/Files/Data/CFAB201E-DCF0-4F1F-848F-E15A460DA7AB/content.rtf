\f1\fs32 As the boiler is operated, the burner tips tend to get clogged with deposits of unburned fuel oil. Once each day the burners must be removed from the boiler and cleaned. The burner is removed and allowed to cool, then the tip is removed and soaked in a burner cleaning solution to loosen up the deposits. After soaking, the remaining deposits are removed by scraping with a brass or copper implement. Soft metal tools are used to avoid damaging the tip and holes. Finally the burner is reassembled, inspected and placed back into service. Be aware that the burner cleaning solution, called <em>carbon remover</em>, will cause chemical burns of your skin and eyes. Always use caution, and wear proper protective gear such as rubber gloves and a face shield, when working with carbon remover. \
