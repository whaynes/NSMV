\f1\fs32 The control of a diesel engine is accomplished through several components: the camshaft, the fuel injector pump, fuel injector and the governor. The camshaft provides the timing needed to properly inject the fuel, the fuel injector pump provides the components that meters and injects the fuel, and the governor regulates the amount of fuel that the injector is to inject. Together, these three major components ensure that the engine runs at the desired speed.
