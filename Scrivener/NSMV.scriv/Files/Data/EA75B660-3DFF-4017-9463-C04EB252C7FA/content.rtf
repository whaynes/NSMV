\f1\fs32 Fire aboard ship is an ever-present threat that can swiftly escalate into a catastrophic disaster. With limited means of escape, a ship becomes a confined space where flames can spread rapidly, fueled by combustible materials and confined by its structure. \
The close quarters, complex layout, and intricate ventilation systems aboard ship create formidable challenges for the ship\'92s small firefighting team. In addition to the immediate threat to human lives, a shipboard fire poses a significant risk to the environment, as toxic smoke, potential oil spills, and the release of hazardous substances can wreak havoc on marine ecosystems. \
