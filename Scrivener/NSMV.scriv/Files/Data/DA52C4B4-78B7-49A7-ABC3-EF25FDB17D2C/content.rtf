\f1\fs32 Surprisingly often, casualties can be predicted.  An alert engineer will notice slight changes in the operating temperatures and pressures over time, which can indicate failing pumps or fouled heat exchangers.  Failing bearings run hotter and noisier, and can easily be detected by touch or with vibration analysis.  Failing electrical insulation has a distinctive smell. Sometimes, the signs are not apparent; you just have a vague feeling that something is not right.  In any event, you should not ignore your hunches, but think through what they might mean and plan for them. You should continuously prepare for casualties before they occur by mentally reviewing potential situations, their consequences, and planning your responses.  \
