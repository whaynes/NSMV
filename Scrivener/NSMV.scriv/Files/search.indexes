            <Title>Two Stroke Cycle</Title>
            <Text>Like the four-stroke engine, the two-stroke engine must go through the same four events: intake, compression, power, and exhaust. But a two-stroke engine requires only two strokes of the piston to complete one full cycle. Therefore, it requires only one rotation of the crankshaft to complete a cycle. This means several events must occur during each stroke for all four events to be completed in two strokes, as opposed to the four-stroke engine where each stroke basically contains one event. 
In a two-stroke engine the camshaft is geared so that it rotates at the same speed as the crankshaft (1:1). The following section will describe a two-stroke, supercharged, diesel engine having intake ports and exhaust valves with a 3.5-inch bore and 4-inch stroke with a 16:1 compression ratio, as it passes through one complete cycle. We will start on the exhaust stroke. All the timing marks given are generic and will vary from engine to engine. Exhaust and Intake

Express a barometric pressure of 27.5 in. Hg, in each of the following units of pressure:  a) atm b) mm Hg c)  kPa d) psi 

&lt;/statement&gt;
&lt;answer&gt;
&lt;me&gt;27.5 \textrm{ in Hg} = 0.919 \textrm{ atm} = 698.5 \textrm{ mm Hg}= 93.3 \textrm{ kPa} =  13.5 \textrm{ psia}&lt;/me&gt;

&lt;solution&gt;
Barometers measure the absolute pressure of the atmosphere, so all results are also absolute pressures.  
For each conversion, we create an appropriate unit-factor from &lt;xref ref="atmos"/&gt;. 
&lt;md&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt;27.5 \textrm{ in Hg} \amp =  27.5 \textrm{ in Hg} \times \left[\frac{1 \textrm{ atm}}{29.92 \textrm{ in Hg}}\right]  \amp = 0.919 \textrm{ atm} &lt;/mrow&gt;

            <Title>Hot bearings</Title>
            <Text>A *hot* bearing is one which is operating above its normal temperature, where *normal* depends on the bearing, the load on the bearing, and the shaft speed. A hot bearing should be watched carefully and rectified before it becomes *uncontrollably hot*.  A bearing is considered 
uncontrollably hot when it reaches 180 °F, has a 50 °F rise across the bearing, or is increasing rapidly and cannot be controlled. The most effective treatment of a hot bearing is to immediately slow down the main engine, which which will reduce the frictional load on the bearing.

The main propulsion system and the turbogenerators, use *plain* bearings to maintain critical radial and axial alignment between the turbine and casings, gears and line shaft.  Plain bearings, which includes cylindrical journal bearings and Kingsbury thrust bearings, are designed to safely transmit the dynamic loads, weight, and thrust of the shaft to the stationary structure of the ship.  They also serve to maintain the radial and axial position of the rotating parts, which is critical to prevent vibration and unwanted contact. 

Plain bearings have two surfaces -- one moving, one stationary -- separated by a wedge of lubricating oil. The oil film prevents the friction and wear resulting from localized welding that occurs when the parts come in contact with each other. The moving element is usually polished steel, either an integral part of the shaft, or a replaceable sleeve, and the stationary surface is usually a *babbitt* coated shell attached to steal backing. A properly designed and lubricated plain bearing has a higher load carrying capacity, a lower coefficient of friction, and a longer life than an equivalent rolling contact bearing.

Babbitt is a soft, white-metal alloy which has excellent bearing properties.  It is a mixture of about 90% tin and 10% mixture of antimony and copper, with traces of lead, iron, arsenic, bismuth, zinc, aluminum, and cadmium.  Babbitt has a ductile composition which enables it to conform to the moving surfaces and promote the formation of a lubricant film.  Foreign particles will embed themselves into the soft babbitt rather than score the shaft.  

Unfortunately babbitt metal has a low melting temperature. If the bearing is allowed to overheat it will soften like butter and the bearing will *wipe*.  Therefore babbitted bearings must be operated within strict temperature limits to avoid serious damage to the plant.  A wiped bearing can stop the ship.

A bearing will not wipe if it is supplied with enough cool, high quality lube oil of the correct viscosity to form an oil wedge and carry away frictional heat.  Any bearing that is uncomfortably hot to touch should be watched carefully, as should any bearing that is operating hotter than it normally does.

When starting up machinery, you should observe the bearing temperatures carefully.  A bearing temperature of 160 °F may be of no concern if it rose to that value gradually, while the engine is operating at full speed.  The same bearing would be a concern if it suddenly spiked to that value in a short period for no apparent reason.  When starting up, a temperature rise of more than about one degree per minute should be investigated.</Text>

            <Title>Supercharging</Title>
            <Text>Supercharging an engine performs the same function as turbocharging an engine. The difference is the source of power used to drive the device that compresses the incoming fresh air. In a supercharged engine, the air is commonly compressed in a device called a blower. The blower is driven through gears directly from the engines crankshaft. The most common type of blower uses two rotating rotors to compress the air. Supercharging is more commonly found on two-stroke engines where the higher pressures that a supercharger is capable of generating are needed.
Supercharging provides an immediate power boost without the lag often associated with turbochargers, although supercharging is generally less efficient because it draws power directly from the engine.</Text>

            <Text>This section contains the Diode Front Edge bridge. This bridge receives the output of the two secondary windings of the propulsion transformer and rectifies this to a DC voltage in the diode bridge. 
The propulsion transformers reduce the network voltage (6,600 V) to the requirements of the frequency converters (1,850V).   The transformers have a single primary winding, delta connected, and two secondary windings, one is delta connected and the other is wye connected. This provides a 30° phase shift in one of the supplies to the diode front end.  This arrangement effectively provides a 12-pulse configuration that reduces harmful harmonics. 
The diode bridge is made up of four stacks of six diodes, one stack to each transformer secondary. The output is passed to the DC Capacitor and filter circuit in the DCC cabinet.

            <Title>Temperature</Title>
            <Text>You are probably already familiar with temperature, and know that we use is it to describe how hot or cold an object is, but what, exactly is it? Temperature is not energy and it’s not heat. It is simply a number related to the average kinetic energy of the molecules of a substance; the greater the average kinetic energy, the greater the temperature. Notice that temperature is not equal to the kinetic energy, just proportional to it, and temperature readings do not tell you anything directly about the potential energy of the substance. 
Temperature can be measured in a variety of scales. When the temperature scale is measured up from the point where there is no molecular motion, it is known as an absolute scale, and is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the molecules in the substance. The Kelvin and Rankine scales are absolute scales. We normally use the Fahrenheit or Celsius scales, which are offset from the corresponding absolute scale, and so are only indirectly related to the kinetic energy.

            <Title>Throttles</Title>
            <Text>The throttle valves are used to throttle (control) the amount of steam allowed to enter the turbines, and hence they control the speed of the ship. On the TS Kennedy, the throttle valves were manually opened and closed by the engineer on watch but on more modern ships they are remotely operated from the bridge.
There are two throttles, the ahead throttle, and the astern throttle. The ahead throttle controls steam to the high pressure turbine and controls the speed of the ship in the ahead (forward) direction. If the ahead throttle is closed, and the astern throttle is opened, steam will be directed to the astern section of the low pressure turbine and the turbine will rotate in the reverse direction.
The ahead and the astern throttles should not be opened at the same time, because this would cause two opposing torques on the low pressure turbine rotor. While this would not necessarily be damaging, it would be a colossal waste of energy. The Astern Guardian Valve is installed in the astern steam line between the astern throttle and the astern turbine to protect against leakage of the astern throttle while the ship is underway. This valve normally remains closed, and is only opened when the ship is expected to maneuver.

            <Title>Fire </Title>
            <Text>Fire aboard ship is an ever-present threat that can swiftly escalate into a catastrophic disaster. With limited means of escape, a ship becomes a confined space where flames can spread rapidly, fueled by combustible materials and confined by its structure. 
The close quarters, complex layout, and intricate ventilation systems aboard ship create formidable challenges for the ship’s small firefighting team. In addition to the immediate threat to human lives, a shipboard fire poses a significant risk to the environment, as toxic smoke, potential oil spills, and the release of hazardous substances can wreak havoc on marine ecosystems.

&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Effective fire prevention measures, comprehensive emergency response plans, rigorous training, and state-of-the-art firefighting equipment are crucial in mitigating this threat and ensuring the safety of everyone on board.
Fire prevention measures play a vital role in minimizing the risk of fire and maintaining a safe environment aboard ship. These measures encompass a range of proactive strategies aimed at preventing fires from starting or spreading. One fundamental aspect is implementing rigorous safety protocols and adhering to international standards, such as the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) regulations for fire safety.
Some key fire prevention measures include:
&lt;ul&gt;
 Regular Inspections and Maintenance. Conducting routine inspections of electrical systems, machinery, and fire suppression equipment is crucial. Identifying and addressing potential hazards, faulty wiring, or malfunctioning equipment can prevent fire incidents.
 Training and Education. Crew members should receive comprehensive training on fire safety, including proper handling of flammable substances, effective use of firefighting equipment, and emergency response procedures. Increasing awareness and knowledge among the crew can significantly reduce the likelihood of fire-related accidents.
 Fire Detection Systems. Installing advanced fire detection systems, such as smoke detectors, heat sensors, and flame detectors, helps in early detection of fires. These systems can trigger alarms, alerting the crew and initiating immediate response actions.
 Fire Suppression Systems. Equipping ships with reliable fire suppression systems, such as fixed CO2 or water mist systems, can effectively control and extinguish fires. These systems are designed to release the appropriate extinguishing agent in the affected area, limiting the fire's spread.
 Proper Storage and Handling. Storing flammable materials in designated areas and following strict protocols for their handling reduces the risk of accidental ignition. Implementing proper waste management procedures and ensuring the availability of suitable fire-resistant containers also contribute to fire prevention efforts.
 Structural Fire Protection. Regulations require fire-resistant materials and insulation in the ship's construction helps to contain fires and slow down their progression. Fire-resistant doors, bulkheads, and insulation compartmentalize the vessel, preventing the rapid spread of flames.
 Emergency Preparedness. Developing and regularly reviewing comprehensive emergency response plans specific to fire incidents is crucial. This includes establishing evacuation procedures, assigning roles and responsibilities to crew members, and conducting fire drills to ensure everyone knows how to respond swiftly and effectively in an emergency.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
By implementing robust fire prevention measures, ships can significantly reduce the risk of fire, enhance the crew's safety, and protect the marine environment from potential devastation.</Text>

            <Text>Pressure is defined as force per unit area. That is, a force acting over an area is a pressure, and when you multiply a pressure by the area that it acts over, you get a force. &lt;me&gt; P = \frac{F}{A} \qquad \text{or} \qquad F = PA &lt;/me&gt;Many different units are used to describe pressure. The simplest pressure units are ones that indicate how much force is applied to an area of a certain size. These units include pounds per square inch, pounds per square foot, newtons per square meter, kilopascals, bars or others depending upon the system being used. Aboard ship we most commonly use pounds per square inch (psi).

            <Text>The only thing that remains to complete the cycle is to return the condensate to the boiler to be heated up again. Unfortunately, the condensate leaving the condenser is at a low pressure and the boiler operates at a much higher pressure. Condensate won’t flow back into the boiler by itself. A pump is required to raise the pressure and return the condensate to the boiler.
The pump, known as the feed pump, draws condensate from the condenser discharge, raises its pressure slightly above the boiler pressure, and discharges it back into the boiler to restart the cycle. Condensate leaving the feed pump is known as feedwater.
Work is required to drive the feed pump, and this energy reduces the net work produced by the cycle and available to turn the shaft. Fortunately, since water is incompressible it takes much less work to raise its pressure back to the boiler pressure than we get from an equivalent pressure drop across the turbine, and so there is a net positive amount of work produced by the cycle.

Switches are also available with many operating behaviors, including:
Momentary switches return to the default state, which can be either open or closed, when released, like a doorbell.
Latching or maintaining contact switches retain the switch position until manually changed, like a light switch.
Toggle switches are operated by flipping a lever to toggle between open and closed positions, providing a straightforward on-off control mechanism.
Selector switches have multiple positions to permit users to choose from different settings or options.
Relays are switches that can be operated remotely by means of an electromagnet.   Relays are used in control circuits and may be operated either manually or by automation.
Contactors are relays designed to handle higher voltages and currents than typical switches or relays, making them suitable for controlling heavy loads, such as motors, heaters, and other heavy-duty equipment.

            <Title>Types of Elbow</Title>
            <Text>Without elbows, it is impossible to think of a piping system on ship, especially in a limited place of installation. Elbows give flexibility for directing and building the piping system leading to saving of space and material.
Different types of elbows are used in the piping system of ships as per the space and design of installation.
 * Male Elbow
A male elbow is a fitting with male threads on both sides and is used for changing the direction of the piping. They fix on to female threads of the fittings on both sides. They come in various angles like 45 degrees and 90 degrees.
* Female Elbow
A female elbow is a pipe fitting that is used to change the direction of the piping and has female threads on both sides, which allow for fixing pipes or fittings with male threads. They come in various angles like 45 degrees and 90 degrees.
* Street Elbow
A street elbow is different from the male and female elbows in the respect that it has a male thread on one side and a female thread on other side. The advantage of using the street elbow is that it can directly fix to the pipe without connecting a nipple. They come in various angles like 45 degrees and 90 degrees.
* Reducing Street Elbow
A reducing street elbow is a pipe fitting that has male thread on one side and unequal female threads on other side. They are used for altering the direction of flow as well as joining pipes of two different sizes. They come in various angles like 45 degrees and 90 degrees.</Text>

            <Title>Boiler Water Treatment</Title>
            <Text>Boiler water must be treated chemically to avoid problems such as Scale, Corrosion, Sludge Formation, and Foaming. Scale is caused by impurities such as calcium and magnesium precipitating out of the water, and by suspended solids settling out and adhering to the tube surfaces. Scale deposits on the tubes act as thermal insulation which reduces the heat transfer across the tubes and increases the tube temperatures. Corrosion due to dissolved oxygen attacks the iron of the tubes and leads to its deterioration. Untreated sludge will bake onto the heat transfer surfaces and cause overheating, and suspended solids will cause a foam to form in the steam drum leading to carryover. 
The boiler water must be tested and boiler chemicals added each day to maintain correct pH levels to limit corrosion, and for correct phosphate levels, which help to precipitate out calcium and magnesium. Periodic surface blowdowns are conducted on a steaming boiler to remove suspended solids, lower the conductivity, and remove dissolved substances contained in the water. Sludge accumulations in the mud drum and headers are removed by conducting bottom blows. A boiler can only receive a bottom blow when it is secured, since blowing a steaming boiler could interrupt the natural circulation flow and cause tube overheating.

            <Title>Pressure Relief Valves</Title>
            <Text>Relief valves are protective devices designed to open automatically when the pressure in the line unit becomes too high. Although there are different types of relief valves, the most common type has a disk that is held in the closed position by a coil spring. When the pressure in the line or machine creates a force great enough to overcome the spring force, the disk moves upward and is opened. After the pressure has been relieved by the escape of fluid through the relief valve, the spring again exerts enough force to close the disk. 
&lt;figure xml:id="crosbyHSJ_png"&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Relief Valve&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image source="images/crosbyHSJ.png" width="35%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Relief valves have no hand-wheel operator, but may be equipped with a lever attached to the valve stem which the operator can use to momentarily open the valve, in order to test that the valve can open properly, or to blow out debris such as rust or dirt, which if lodged between the disk and seat would cause the valve to leak. 
Relief valves are designed to work properly with any type of fluid, while safety valves are only designed to work with gases. 
Most relief valves are set to open when the pressure against the disk reaches 110% of the &lt;em&gt;Maximum Allowable Working Pressure&lt;/em&gt; (called the MAWP) of the system or machine. For example, if a system operates with a MAWP of 100 psi, then the relief valve would open at 110 psi. 
Relief valves are designed to close at a pressure lower than their opening pressure (The difference between opening and closing pressure is called &lt;em&gt;blowdown&lt;/em&gt;). This is done to prevent &lt;em&gt;valve chattering&lt;/em&gt;, which is a rapid opening and closing of the valve. Chattering is undesirable because it can damage the seat and disk. If the valve opened and closed at exactly the same pressure, it would chatter, because as soon as it opened, the pressure would drop and cause the valve to close, and as soon as it closed the pressure would cause it to open again. 
Chattering is prevented by exposing an additional disk surface area to the fluid pressure immediately after the valve opens. This increased area, acted upon by the fluid pressure, increases the force against the spring, and makes the valve open rapidly once it starts to open, but it will not close again until the pressure falls significantly below the opening pressure. 
It must be remembered that the coil spring force acting when the valve begins to open is the same as the spring force acting when the valve closes. Since  F = PA :  &lt;me&gt;P_o A_o = P_c A_c&lt;/me&gt;  Where: &lt;ul marker=""&gt;
P_o is the Opening pressure. 
P_c is the Closing pressure. 
A_o is the Opening area. 
A_c is the Closing area. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
Remember, the extra surface area is not available until the valve disk opens.

            <Title>Reactance</Title>
            <Text>Reactance is a property that represents opposition to current flow in AC systems due to reactive components like capacitors and inductors. Unlike resistance, which is related to the dissipation of energy as heat, reactance is associated with the storage and release of energy in the electric or magnetic fields of the reactive components.
There are two types of reactance:
Capacitive Reactance X_C: Capacitive reactance occurs in circuits containing capacitors. When AC voltage is applied to a capacitor, it causes a displacement of charge between the plates, resulting in the accumulation and discharge of energy. This leads to a phase shift between the voltage and current waveforms. Capacitive reactance is inversely proportional to the frequency of the AC signal so is less significant at high frequencies. 
Inductive Reactance X_L: Inductive reactance arises in circuits containing inductors. When AC voltage is applied to an inductor, it induces a magnetic field that stores energy. Changes in the magnetic field cause an opposing voltage that leads to a phase shift between voltage and current. Inductive reactance is directly proportional to the frequency of the AC signal so is less significant at low frequencies.
Reactance is measured in ohms (\Omega), just like resistance. However, reactance has both magnitude and phase, making it a complex quantity. The magnitude of reactance determines how much opposition a reactive component offers to the AC current, while the phase shift characterizes the timing difference between the voltage and current waveforms.
Impedance Z: is a measure of the total opposition to flow of current in an AC circuit due to both resistance and reactance.&lt;me&gt; Z = \sqrt{R^2+ (X_L -X_C)^2} &lt;/me&gt;.  Impedance has units of ohms.
Phase shift:  In a circuit with no reactive elements, the current and voltage sine waves are in phase, &lt;ie/&gt;  their peaks and valleys line up.  However reactive elements cause the current and voltage waves to shift out of phase.  An inductor will cause the current to lag behind the voltage, while a capacitor will cause the current to lead the voltage.

            <Text>A job hazard analysis (JHA), also known as a job safety analysis (JSA), is a systematic process used to identify and analyze potential hazards or risks associated with specific job tasks or activities. Its primary purpose is to reduce the risk of accidents by identifying potential hazards and developing appropriate controls to mitigate them.
The process typically involves breaking down a job into its individual steps  and examining each step to identify potential hazards. Hazards can include physical hazards (e.g., machinery, equipment, or environmental conditions), chemical hazards (e.g., exposure to hazardous substances), biological hazards (e.g., exposure to infectious agents), ergonomic hazards (e.g., repetitive motion or lifting heavy objects), or any other factors that could pose a risk to worker safety and health.
The key steps in conducting a job hazard analysis typically include: 
&lt;ol&gt;
Select the job or task to be analyzed.
Break down the job into steps.
Identify potential hazards for each step.
Determine the risk level for each identified hazard.  Risk level multiplies severity and the likelihood of each identified hazard.
Develop hazard controls to eliminate or minimize the hazards. This might include engineering controls (e.g., machine guarding), administrative controls (e.g., training or procedures), or personal protective equipment (PPE)
Communicate the findings to workers and stakeholders to ensure awareness and buy-in.
Regularly review and update the job hazard analysis.
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
This results of the JHA can be shared with the crew during a toolbox talk in order to raise awareness about known hazards, reinforce safe work practices, and promote a culture of safety. These talks are usually conducted before the start of the work day.
Systematically analyzing and communicating job hazards and implementing appropriate controls helps to create a safer workplace.

            <Title>History of the Internal Combustion Engine</Title>
            <Text>&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt; Nicolaus Otto (1832)&lt;/caption&gt; 
  &lt;image source="images/diesel-image3.png" width="25%"/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
The first practical alternative to the steam engine was invented in 1861 Nicolaus August Otto. Later, in partnership with German industrialist Eugen Langen, they improved the design and won a gold medal at the World Exposition in Paris of 1867.  In 1876, Otto, then a traveling salesman, chanced upon a newspaper account of the Lenoir internal combustion engine. Before year's end, Otto had built an internal combustion engine, utilizing a four-stroke piston cycle. 
Otto's design called for four strokes of a piston to draw in and compress a gas-air mixture within a cylinder resulting in an internal explosion.  He received patent #365,701 for his gas-motor engine, now called the Otto cycle in his honor. Because of its reliability, efficiency, and relative quietness, more than 30,000 Otto cycle engines were built in the next 10 years. He also developed low-voltage magneto ignition systems for his engines, allowing a much greater ease in starting. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt; Rudolf Diesel (1858) &lt;/caption&gt;
  &lt;image source="images/diesel-image4.png" width="25%"/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
Dr. Rudolf Diesel was born in 1858 in France and began his career as a refrigeration engineer. For ten years he worked on various heat engines, including a solar-powered air engine. Diesel's ideas for an engine where the combustion would be carried out within the cylinder were published in 1893. 
The modern diesel engine came about as the result of the internal combustion principles first proposed by Sadi Carnot in the early 19th century. Dr. Rudolf Diesel applied Sadi Carnot's principles into a patented cycle or method of combustion that has become known as the &lt;q&gt;diesel&lt;/q&gt; cycle. His patented engine operated when the heat generated during the compression of the air fuel charge caused ignition of the mixture, which then expanded at a constant pressure during the full power stroke of the engine. Dr. Diesel's first engine ran on coal dust and used a compression pressure of 1500 psi to increase its theoretical efficiency. Also, his first engine did not have provisions for any type of cooling system. Consequently, between the extreme pressure and the lack of cooling, the engine exploded and almost killed its inventor. After recovering from his injuries, Diesel tried again using oil as the fuel, adding a cooling water jacket around the cylinder, and lowering the compression pressure to approximately 550 psi. This combination eventually proved successful. Production rights to the engine were sold to Adolphus Bush, who built the first diesel engines for commercial use, installing them in his St. Louis brewery to drive various pumps.</Text>

            <Title>introduction</Title>
            <Text>Centrifugal pumps use centrifugal force to transfer the mechanical energy supplied to the pump into primarily kinetic energy (velocity) in the fluid being pumped. Centrifugal force is the force generated by rotation which acts outward from the center of rotation. Using the terminology already covered, centrifugal pumps are classified as:  non-positive displacement pumps,  non-self priming, and are  constant delivery for a given operating speed and discharge pressure. Because of their simplicity, low cost and ability to operate under a wide variety of conditions, centrifugal pumps are widely used. They can be adapted to produce any head up to several thousand feet and will handle liquids at temperatures up to 1000° F. They can also be designed to handle liquids containing a high proportion of rather large solid particles. 
&lt;figure xml:id="centpump_png"&gt;
 &lt;caption&gt;Centrifugal Pump&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;image source="images/centpump.png" width="50%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
A centrifugal pump consists of a rotating element called the  impeller, which is the only moving part in the pump, and a specially shaped housing, or pump  casing. In practically all centrifugal pumps, liquid enters the rotating element at the center through the  eye, and is given a rotary motion in the pump chamber by the rotation of a number of impeller blades (generally called  vanes). The rotation of the impeller in a true centrifugal pump does two things. Centrifugal force drives the liquid directly out from the center of the impeller, setting up a greater pressure in the chamber at the outer edge of the impeller than at the eye. At the same time the liquid is also pushed around and around by the turning of the vanes, and is given more and more velocity as it moves farther out from the eye. The liquid finally leaves the impeller tangentially at the end of the vanes with a high velocity, and flows into the discharge passage of the pump housing surrounding the impeller. 
The discharge passage gradually widens as it leads the liquid away from the impeller to the discharge nozzle on the pump housing. The gradual widening of the discharge passage reduces the velocity of the liquid. Since the reduction in velocity does not produce work, it results in a change in the type of energy contained in the liquid. Most of the velocity (kinetic energy) in the liquid produced by the centrifugal pump is transformed into pressure (potential energy) by the widening discharge passage. This type of energy is more available for doing work. On most centrifugal pumps this widening passage is built into the pump casing that surrounds the impeller and is called the  volute. Additional conversion of velocity to pressure may be accomplished in the discharge nozzle and sometimes in the piping leading away from the pump. 
Recall that a reduction in the velocity of a liquid (without producing any work) changes the type of energy contained in the liquid into increased pressure. The reverse is also true. If the pressure in a liquid is reduced (without producing any work) then the velocity of the liquid must increase.) 
When liquid is forced away from the eye by centrifugal force, a reduced pressure area is created in the eye causing more liquid to flow in. This creates a constant flow through the impeller and out through the discharge of the centrifugal pump. 
In a centrifugal pump, the velocity that can be imparted to the liquid, and the resulting discharge pressure depends upon both the impeller diameter and the impeller RPM. Increasing either results in: &lt;ul&gt;
 higher centrifugal force 
 higher liquid velocity 
 higher pressure 
 &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The centrifugal pump, with a certain size impeller operating at a set speed, will only put enough energy in the liquid to create a specific discharge pressure. If the resistance in the discharge piping rises to the maximum pressure the pump can create, liquid flow through the pump stops. The centrifugal pump is said to be operating at its  shut-off head and no liquid is delivered by the pump. Friction between the rotating impeller and the liquid trapped in the pump casing increases the liquid temperature, possibly causing it to vaporize. To prevent vaporization of the liquid in a high speed centrifugal pump handling very hot liquids, a small pipeline is installed on the discharge side of the pump to divert a small amount of liquid back to the supply tank on the suction side of the pump. This small quantity of liquid flowing through the pump acts as a cooling system constantly removing the heated liquid from the pump casing and replacing it with cooler liquid from the supply tank. These lines are called  recirculating lines and are always found on shipboard turbine-driven centrifugal feed pumps because they are frequently subjected to shut-off head when the ship’s main engine is stopped or maneuvering. 
Impeller vanes which curve backwards with respect to their direction of rotation are more efficient and give better performance than straight vanes; however, the pump must be turned in the correct direction to obtain this efficiency. The advantage of straight vane impellers is that they have the same efficiency in either direction of pump rotation. In &lt;xref ref="centpump_png"/&gt;, the impeller rotation is counter-clockwise allowing the liquid to be pushed around the pump chamber by the vanes, rather than being carried by them. If a curved vane impeller was operated in the wrong direction rotation, it would still deliver some liquid, but the following would be observed: &lt;ul&gt;
 The pump would require more power to turn the impellor backwards. 
 The pump discharge capacity would decrease. 
 The pump efficiency would decrease. 
 &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text>

            <Text>Threaded pipe connections, also known as screw or tapered pipe threads, are a common method for joining pipes and fittings in plumbing, industrial, and fluid conveyance systems. These connections involve the use of threads, which are helical ridges or grooves on the exterior or interior surface of a pipe or fitting, to create a secure and leak-resistant joint. Here's how threaded pipe connections work:

1. **Male and Female Threads:** In threaded connections, one component (typically a pipe or fitting) has male threads, while the other component has female threads. The male threads are external and project outward, while the female threads are internal and are located inside a threaded socket or coupling.

2. **Tapered Threads:** Threaded pipe connections often use tapered threads, which means that the threads are wider at the base and narrower at the tip. This taper creates a wedge effect when the components are threaded together, resulting in a tight seal.

3. **Thread Sealant:** To ensure a leak-resistant connection, thread sealant is often applied to the male threads before assembly. Common sealants include thread tape (Teflon tape) or thread compound. These sealants help fill in gaps and create a watertight seal when the components are screwed together.

4. **Assembly:** To create the connection, the male-threaded end of one component is inserted into the female-threaded end of the other component. As the components are twisted together, the threads engage and draw the two pieces closer, compressing the sealant and creating a secure joint.

5. **Tightening:** Care must be taken not to over-tighten threaded connections, as this can damage the threads or distort the sealing surfaces. The connection should be tightened by hand until it is snug, and then an additional one-quarter to one-half turn is usually sufficient to create a proper seal.

6. **Wrenches:** Depending on the size and material of the components, a pipe wrench or other suitable wrench may be used to facilitate the final tightening of the connection. Be cautious not to over-tighten, as mentioned earlier.

Threaded pipe connections are widely used in plumbing systems, natural gas lines, water supply systems, and various industrial applications because they are relatively easy to assemble and disassemble. They are particularly common in applications where frequent maintenance and modifications may be necessary.

However, it's important to note that threaded connections are susceptible to wear and corrosion over time. Proper installation, regular inspection, and maintenance are essential to ensure the integrity and leak-free performance of threaded pipe connections. In some cases, threaded connections may be replaced with other types of connections, such as soldered, welded, or flanged connections, for increased durability and reliability in critical applications.</Text>

            <Title>Steam Drum</Title>
            <Text>The steam drum, &lt;xref ref="steamdrum_png"/&gt;, is a cylindrical steel vessel located near the top of the boiler. It serves two purposes: it is an upper reservoir for the water in the boiler, and it is the point where the steam is separated from the water. The normal steam/water interface is located half way up the steam drum, and visible to the operator through the &lt;em&gt;boiler gage glass&lt;/em&gt;. It is critical that a water level be maintained in the steam drum at all times when the boiler is operating. Without sufficient water in the boiler, the heat of the furnace would melt the boiler tubes and disable the boiler. One of the engineer’s most critical duties is to maintain the water level in the boiler at all times. 
&lt;figure xml:id="steamdrum_png2"&gt;
 &lt;caption&gt;Steam Drum Internals&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;image source="pics/boilers/steamdrum.png" width="75%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
The lower portion of the steam drum, where it is perforated by the boiler tubes is thicker than the upper section, for strength. The lower portion is called the &lt;em&gt;tube sheet&lt;/em&gt;, and the upper portion is called the &lt;em&gt;wrapper sheet&lt;/em&gt;. The ends of the steam drum are known as the &lt;em&gt;heads&lt;/em&gt;, and one of the heads is fitted with a &lt;em&gt;manhole&lt;/em&gt;, to allow access to the inside of the drum for inspection or repair. 
The top of the steam drum is fitted with an air cock, which is simply a pipe terminated with two valves. When the valves are open, the boiler steam drum pressure can equalize with the atmosphere. The air cock is opened when the boiler is first lit off. As the steam begins to form, it is allowed to blow out the air cock, expelling any air which has collected in the drum. After the steam pressure has built up to 20–30 psi and all air is expelled, the air cock is closed to seal the drum. It remains closed at all times while the boiler is operating, and is not opened again until the boiler is secured. After the fires are extinguished and as the boiler begins to cool down, the air cock must be reopened again at about 50 psi. Otherwise, the condensing steam in the steam drum will create a vacuum there, breaking the seal at the boiler hand-hole gaskets, which are primarily designed to seal against internal, not external, pressure. 
A &lt;em&gt;steam drum safety valve&lt;/em&gt; is also located on top of the steam drum. This valve is adjusted to open automatically if the steam drum pressure rises too high. This can protect the boiler from exploding, and the noise of the steam flowing through should alert the engineer that something is seriously wrong. If you ever hear a boiler safety valve blowing off steam, your first action as an engineer should be to secure the fires, to prevent additional steam from being generated, until you know what is causing the problem. 
Inside the steam drum you will find several internal fittings. These fittings help distribute water evenly throughout the drum, separate the generated steam from the water, and remove moisture from the steam before it leaves the boiler. The &lt;em&gt;dry pipe&lt;/em&gt; is a perforated tube located at the top of the steam drum. As steam is formed and rises to the top of the boiler, it enters the dry pipe and from there it is removed from the steam drum. It is important that no moisture enter the dry pipe, because water droplets in the steam would damage the turbines downstream, so modern boilers include &lt;em&gt;cyclone steam separators&lt;/em&gt; which help to remove moisture from the steam by causing it to spin rapidly around a spiral path as it moves upward. The centrifugal force throws the heavier water droplets to the separator walls, where it drains back to the drum. Only dry steam should make it through the separator. A &lt;em&gt;chemical feed pipe&lt;/em&gt; is provided to distribute boiler chemicals throughout the steam drum. Another perforated pipe known as the &lt;em&gt;internal feed pipe&lt;/em&gt; is located below the water level and is used to distribute the incoming feedwater evenly throughout the steam drum. The &lt;em&gt;surface blow pipe&lt;/em&gt; is another perforated pipe located below the water level and connected overboard. Opening the &lt;em&gt;surface blow valve&lt;/em&gt; allows boiler water to discharge over the side. This is done to rid the boiler of contaminants such as suspended solids, oil and excess boiler chemicals, and in emergencies to lower the boiler water level quickly. 
You may also find a &lt;em&gt;submerged tube desuperheater&lt;/em&gt; in the steam drum. This is a pipe which makes several passes underneath the surface of the water in the steam drum. Superheated steam is passed through this pipe, where it cools down to near its saturation temperature. Internal desuperheaters like this are used for two purposes. Most commonly, they are used to provide desuperheated steam for auxiliary systems which are not designed to operate on high temperature superheated steam. Other desuperheaters are used to reduce and control the temperature of the main superheated steam by blending the hot superheated steam with cooler desuperheated steam; this type is called a &lt;em&gt;control desuperheater.&lt;/em&gt;

            <Title>Air Intake System</Title>
            <Text>Because a diesel engine requires close tolerances to achieve its compression ratio, and because most diesel engines are either turbocharged or supercharged, the air entering the engine must be clean, free of debris, and as cool as possible. Turbocharging and supercharging are discussed in more detail later in this chapter. Also, to improve a turbocharged or supercharged engine's efficiency, the compressed air must be cooled after being compressed. The air intake system is designed to perform these tasks. Air intake systems vary greatly from vendor to vendor but are usually one of two types, wet or dry. In a wet filter intake system, as shown in Figure 14, the air is sucked or bubbled through a housing that holds a bath of oil such that the dirt in the air is removed by the oil in the filter. The air then flows through a screen-type material to ensure any entrained oil is removed from the air. In a dry filter system, paper, cloth, or a metal screen material is used to catch and trap dirt before it enters the engine (similar to the type used in automobile engines). In addition to cleaning the air, the intake system is usually designed to intake fresh air from as far away from the engine as practicable, usually just outside of the engine's building or enclosure. This provides the engine with a supply of air that has not been heated by the engine's own waste heat. The reason for ensuring that an engine's air supply is as cool as possible is that cool air is more dense than hot air. This means that, per unit volume, cool air has more oxygen than hot air. Thus, cool air provides more oxygen per cylinder charge than less dense, hot air. More oxygen means a more efficient fuel burn and more power. After being filtered, the air is routed by the intake system into the engine's intake manifold or air box. The manifold or air box is the component that directs the fresh air to each of the engine's intake valves or ports. If the engine is turbocharged or supercharged, the fresh air will be compressed with a blower and possibly cooled before entering the intake manifold or air box. The intake system also serves to reduce the air flow noise.

            <Text>The exhaust system of a diesel engine performs three functions. First, the exhaust system routes the spent combustion gases away from the engine, where they are diluted by the atmosphere. This keeps the area around the engine habitable. Second, the exhaust system confines and routes the gases to the turbocharger, if used. Third, the exhaust system allows mufflers to be used to reduce the engine noise.

            <Title>Specific Heat</Title>
            <Text>In the discussion of sensible heat and latent heat, you may have noticed that it takes only 16 BTU to raise the temperature of 1 pound of ice from 0 °F to 32 °F that is, only 1/2 BTU for each degree of rise in temperature. However, we know that it takes 1 BTU (on the average) to raise the temperature of the same amount of water 1 °F. This difference occurs because the &lt;em&gt;specific heat&lt;/em&gt; of water is about twice the specific heat of ice. 
Specific heat is a thermal property of matter that must be determined experimentally for each substance. In general, we may say that specific heat is the property of matter; this explains the reason that equal quantities of thermal energy added to two different substances will not necessarily produce the same temperature rise, even when no change of state is involved. The specific heat of a substance is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of unit mass of the substance 1 °F. For most engineering applications, specific heat is expressed in BTU per pound per degree Fahrenheit. In metric systems of measurement, specific heat is expressed in calories per gram per degree Celsius. Even though the units of measurement are different in the different systems, the &lt;em&gt;numerical value&lt;/em&gt; of specific heat for any given substance is the same in all systems. The specific heat of water is 1.00 in all systems.

            <Title>Compression Ratio and Clearance Volume</Title>
            <Text>Clearance volume is the volume remaining in the cylinder when the piston is at TDC. Because of the irregular shape of the combustion chamber (volume in the head) the clearance volume is determined empirically measuring the amount of fluid required to fill the chamber while the piston is at TDC. This volume is then added to the displacement volume in the cylinder to obtain the cylinder's total volume. 
An engine's compression ratio is the ratio of the volume of the cylinder when the piston is at the bottom of its stroke (BDC) to the volume when the piston is at the top of its stroke (TDC), as shown in &lt;xref ref="compression-ratio-pic"/&gt;. 

&lt;figure xml:id="compression-ratio-pic"&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Compression Ratio&lt;/caption&gt; 
  &lt;image source="images/compression-ratio.png" width="60%"/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;me&gt;\text{Compression Ratio (CR)} = \frac{V_c + V_d}{V_c}&lt;/me&gt; Where: &lt;ul marker=""&gt;
V_c  is the clearance volume (the volume of the combustion chamber when the piston is at TDC), and
V_d is the engine displacement (the volume swept by the piston as it moves from BDC to TDC).
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;example&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Compression Ratio&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;statement&gt;
Determine the compression ratio of an engine with the following specifications: &lt;ul marker = ""&gt;
Bore = 100 mm
Stroke = 80 mm
Clearance Volume   = 50 cc
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/statement&gt;
&lt;answer&gt;
This engine has a compression ratio of approximately 13.57:1
&lt;/answer&gt;
&lt;solution&gt;

Calculate the engine displacement (Swept Volume):
  &lt;me&gt;
   V_d = \pi \times \left(\frac{100}{2}\right)^2 \times 80 = 628,318.53 \text{ mm}^3 = 628.3 \text{ cc}
   &lt;/me&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Calculate Compression Ratio:
   &lt;me&gt;
   CR = \frac{V_c + V_d}{V_c} = \frac{50 + 628.3}{50} = \frac{678.3}{50} \approx 13.57:1
   &lt;/me&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
This engine would have a compression ratio of approximately 13.57:1.
&lt;/solution&gt;

            <Text>The bonnet houses the equipment necessary to operate the gate and is attached and   sealed to the body using the same methods as on globe valves. 

&lt;figure xml:id="Bonnet_Styles_png"&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Types of Bonnets&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image source="images/Bonnet_Styles.png" width="90%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Gate valves are available in different types of stem connections. &lt;xref ref="Bonnet_Styles_png"/&gt; illustrates three different types.  &lt;ol&gt;
Non-rising stem, inside screw (A)  The stem screws down into the valve gate as the valve is opened. In this type the stem does not rise or fall outside the valve body as the valve is opened or closed, it simply rotates. 
Rising stem, inside screw (B) The stem rises outside the valve as the valve is opened, but the stem screw operates inside the body of the valve. When operated, the valve stem in this design rises and rotates. 
&lt;li&gt;
Rising stem, outside screw and yoke (C)  The stem screw operates at the level of the hand-wheel, so the stem rises independently of the hand-wheel as the valve is opened. The valve stem rises, but does not rotate. Instead of the valve stem rotating, the hand-wheel rotates the yoke bushing pulling the stem straight up. Valve stem threads can be easily cleaned and lubricated in this design. 
Outside screw and yoke design is required on gate valves when diameters exceed 3" and pressures exceed 600 psig.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

Notice that in both type A and B, the stem threads are exposed to the fluids flowing   through the valve. Fluids can eventually corrode the threads and fluids with solids   entrained can cause the threads to bind up and create excessive wear. 
Valves with rising stems are used when it is important to know by immediate inspection   whether the valve is opened or closed. The outside screw and yoke type easily indicates   valve position due to the stem extending out beyond the center of the valve wheel when   it is open. 
The non-rising type is the least likely to leak in the packing area and requires less   installation space.

            <Title>Principle of Operation</Title>
            <Text>A three-phase induction motor sometimes called a squirrel-cage motor, is a type of electric motor that operates based on the principles of electromagnetic induction. 
&lt;figure xml:id="induction_motor"&gt;

&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
The stator carries three identical sets of phase windings placed 120 degrees apart in a symmetrical pattern and connected in wye.. The specific pattern of the windings determines the number of magnetic poles.  Small motors typically have two or four poles per phase, but the ship’s propulsion motors have ten poles per phase. 
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Stator Windings&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;sidebyside width="30%" valign="bottom"&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;  Complete  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;image  source="images/stator_2"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/sidebyside&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

When three-phase AC power is applied to the stator windings, a rotating magnetic field develops rotating at the synchronous speed. 
The synchronous speed is determined by the frequency of the power supply and the number of motor poles.  &lt;me&gt;n_s =\frac{120 f}{ P}&lt;/me&gt; Where: &lt;ul marker=""&gt;
n_s is the synchronous speed in revolutions per minute (RPM).
f is the frequency of the power supply in hertz (Hz).
P is the number of magnetic poles per phase.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Synchronous speed represents the speed the motor will spin under no load conditions.  
The rotor is typically made of a laminated iron core with conductive bars embedded within it.  The bars are shorted at the ends, to form closed loop rotor windings. 
&lt;figure xml:id="rotor_cutaway"&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;  Rotor Cutaway Diagram &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;image width="75%" source="images/rotor_cutaway"&gt;
&lt;remix&gt;&lt;source&gt;Siemens STEP program Basics of Induction Motors   &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/remix&gt;
&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
As the rotating magnetic field passes over the rotor windings, it induces a voltage, according to Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction. This voltage drives a current through the rotor windings, which, in turn, generates a magnetic field surrounding the rotor windings.
The magnetic field of the rotor interacts with the rotating magnetic field of the stator and magnetic attraction pulls the rotor in the same direction as the rotating magnetic field. As the rotor rotates, it tries to catch up with the rotating magnetic field. 
However, the mechanical load on the motor retards the shaft, so the rotor  speed n, always remains slightly less than the synchronous speed, n_s.  The difference between the synchronous speed and the actual 
operating speed is called slip, often expressed as a percentage of the synchronous speed &lt;me&gt;\textrm{\% slip}= \left(\frac{n_s-n}{n_s}\right) \times 100\%&lt;/me&gt;.
The difference in speed between the rotating magnetic field and the rotor's rotational speed induces the current, torque, and power that drives the load connected to the motor shaft.   Slip is required for the motor to generate torque and perform useful work.
The mechanical power produced by a motor can be calculated using the formula:&lt;me&gt;P  = \tau \omega&lt;/me&gt; Where: &lt;ul marker=""&gt;
P is the shaft power in Watt (W). 
\tau is torque or twisting force generated by the motor, measured in Newton-meters (Nm).
\omega is the angular velocity of the motor in radians per second (rad/s).  Angular velocity is equal to the shaft rpm \times \frac{2\pi}{60}.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
In practical applications, mechanical power can also be expressed in other units such as kilowatts (kW), Horsepower (HP),  or foot-pounds per minute (ft-lb/min).
An increase in load on the motor causes the shaft to slow down slightly, which increases both slip and torque.  The power output of the motor automatically adjusts to match the requirements of the load.
Although the motor always has some slip, the rotor speed is generally close to the synchronous speed.  For a motor with a fixed number of poles, the rotor speed can be changed by changing the frequency of the power supply with a variable speed drive or a frequency converter.

            <Text> &lt;em&gt;Heat&lt;/em&gt; is a more familiar term than internal energy, but may actually be more difficult to define correctly. The important thing to remember is that heat is &lt;em&gt;thermal energy in transition&lt;/em&gt; - that is, it is thermal energy that is moving from one substance or system to another. 
An example will help to illustrate the difference between heat and internal energy. Suppose there are two equal lengths of pipe made of identical materials and containing steam at the same pressure and temperature. One pipe is well insulated; the other is not insulated at all. From everyday experience you know that more heat will flow from the uninsulated pipe than from the insulated pipe. When the two pipes are first filled with steam, the steam in one pipe contains exactly as much internal energy as the steam in the other pipe. We know this is true because the two pipes contain equal volumes of steam at the same pressure and at the same temperature. After a few minutes, the steam in the uninsulated pipe will contain much less internal energy than the steam in the insulated pipe, as we can tell by measuring the pressure and the temperature of the steam in each pipe. What has happened? Stored thermal energy - internal energy - has moved from one system to another, first from the steam to the pipe, then from the uninsulated pipe to the air. This movement or flow of thermal energy from one system to another is called heat. 
A good deal of confusion exists concerning the use of the word &lt;q&gt;heat.&lt;/q&gt; For example, you will hear people say that a hot object &lt;q&gt;contains&lt;/q&gt; a lot of heat when they really mean that it contains a lot of internal energy. Or you will hear that heat is &lt;q&gt;added to&lt;/q&gt; or &lt;q&gt;removed from&lt;/q&gt; a substance. Since heat is the flow of thermal energy, it can no more be added to a substance than the flow of water could be added to a river. (You might add water, and this addition might increase the flow; but you could hardly say that you had added flow.) The only kind of thermal energy that can in any sense be added to or removed from a substance is internal energy. The distinction between heat and internal energy must be clear in your own mind before you can understand the basic principles of a steam plant. Remember, steam contains internal energy but it does not &lt;q&gt;contain heat.&lt;/q&gt; Heat exists when the internal energy flows from the steam to something else (another substance or system).

            <Title>Capsule Gages is a device used to measure low-pressure ranges with high accuracy. It is particularly effective in applications where sensitive pressure measurement is required, such as in laboratory settings, HVAC systems, and certain industrial processes.

### Components and Construction
A capsule-type pressure gauge primarily consists of the following components:

1. **Capsule Element**: The heart of the gauge is the capsule element, which is made up of two thin, corrugated diaphragms welded or sealed together at their edges to form a sealed capsule. This capsule expands and contracts in response to pressure changes.
   
2. **Pointer and Dial**: The gauge has a pointer (needle) that moves over a calibrated dial to indicate pressure readings. The dial is marked with pressure units relevant to the application.

3. **Movement Mechanism**: This includes gears and linkages that transmit the motion of the capsule to the pointer. The mechanism translates the expansion and contraction of the capsule into rotational movement of the pointer.

4. **Pressure Connection**: This is the port where the pressure medium (gas or fluid) enters the gauge and applies pressure to the capsule.

### Working Principle
The operation of a capsule-type pressure gauge is based on the deformation of the capsule element under pressure. Here's how it works:

1. **Pressure Application**: When pressure is applied through the pressure connection, the pressure medium enters the capsule.
   
2. **Capsule Deformation**: The applied pressure causes the thin diaphragms of the capsule to either expand or contract, depending on the pressure difference across the capsule walls.

3. **Mechanical Movement**: The deformation of the capsule is converted into mechanical movement through the movement mechanism. This movement is usually small and requires a sensitive mechanism to accurately reflect the pressure change.

4. **Pointer Movement**: The mechanical movement is transferred to the pointer, causing it to move across the dial. The dial is calibrated to convert the movement into a readable pressure value.

### Applications
Capsule-type pressure gauges are commonly used in scenarios requiring precise measurement of low pressures, such as:

- **Laboratory and Research**: For measuring low-pressure differentials in scientific experiments.
- **HVAC Systems**: To monitor and control air pressure in ventilation and air conditioning systems.
- **Medical Equipment**: In devices such as anesthesia machines and respiratory equipment.
- **Industrial Processes**: Where accurate low-pressure measurement is critical for process control and safety.

### Advantages
- **High Sensitivity**: Capable of detecting small changes in pressure, making them ideal for low-pressure applications.
- **Accuracy**: Provides precise and reliable pressure readings.
- **Compact Design**: Generally smaller and more compact compared to other types of pressure gauges.

### Limitations
- **Fragility**: The thin diaphragms can be delicate and susceptible to damage if exposed to high pressures or harsh conditions.
- **Limited Pressure Range**: Typically suitable only for low-pressure measurements.

In summary, capsule-type pressure gauges are specialized instruments designed for precise low-pressure measurement. Their unique design, based on the deformation of a capsule element, allows for high sensitivity and accuracy, making them suitable for various sensitive and critical applications.</Title>

            <Title>Vane Pumps</Title>
            <Text>In  vane pumps, the rotor is fitted with a number of slots into which movable vanes are installed. The pump chamber is larger in diameter than the rotor and the rotor is offset in the pump chamber so that they almost come in contact with each other at the 12 o’clock position and are separated by some distance at the 6 o’clock position. As the rotor revolves, the vanes are thrown out by centrifugal force to bear against the inside surface of the pump chamber. (Liquid pressure behind the vanes also pushes them in contact with the chamber wall and sometimes springs are used behind the vanes to force them against the chamber wall) As the rotor turns from the 12 o’clock position to the 6 o’clock position, it moves away from the chamber wall and liquid flows into the space between the moving vanes. From approximately the 5 o’clock to the 7 o’clock position, the liquid is trapped between two vanes, the rotor and the chamber wall and is pushed to the discharge side of the pump. As the rotor revolves back to the 12 o’clock position, the space between the rotor and the chamber wall decreases, forcing the liquid to the discharge connection on the pump casing. Different designs of vanes may be used, as shown in &lt;xref ref="vane_png"/&gt;, but the sliding vane type is most common.

            <Text>A shipboard electrical distribution system controls and distributes electrical power from the ship’s generators to the electrical consumers around the ship. 
Ships typically use 460 volt, 60 Hz, three-phase AC for major electrical machinery, and 120 volt, 60 Hz, single-phase for lights, receptacles, and small motors.  These are considered Low Voltage (LV) systems, although even 120 volts can be dangerous. 
High voltage (above 1 kV) is used for very large motors, 400 kW or greater, such as propulsion motors, and thrusters. Marine HV systems typically operate at 3.3 kV or 6.6 kV or 11 kV.   
The advantage of higher voltages is that for a given power, higher voltage means lower current.  (Recall &lt;xref ref="three-phase-PEI"/&gt;) Reduced current means that smaller diameter conductors can be used, the machine will be physically smaller and thus cheaper, and the machine will be more efficient because it will have smaller I^2 R losses. (Recall  &lt;xref ref="I2R"/&gt;)

            <Text>Fatigue can significantly impair cognitive abilities, including attention, concentration, memory, and decision-making. This can lead to reduced performance and increased errors, particularly in tasks that require sustained focus or critical thinking, such as driving, operating machinery, or performing complex work.
Fatigue can slow down reaction times and impair alertness, making it more challenging to respond quickly and appropriately to stimuli or unexpected events. This can increase the risk of accidents, both in occupational settings and during activities like driving or operating heavy equipment.
Fatigue-related impairment can lead to an increased risk of accidents and injuries across various domains, including workplaces, roadways, and other high-risk environments. Fatigue-related accidents have been linked to major incidents in industries such as transportation, healthcare, and manufacturing.
Fatigue can impair an individual's ability to assess risks accurately and make sound judgments. This can result in poor decision-making, potentially leading to safety hazards or negative consequences in various aspects of life, including personal relationships and professional responsibilities.</Text>

            <Text>The pumping principle of the Bosch pump is illustrated by &lt;xref ref="bosch-fig"/&gt;, in which four steps of a pumping stroke are shown. 
In &lt;xref ref="bosch-fig-a"/&gt;, the plunger is below the inlet and spill ports. Fuel oil enters the barrel, as indicated by the small arrows, and fills the barrel chamber (between the plunger and the delivery valve). The plunger has a flat top, and the two ports are set at the same level. The two ports are closed by the plunger at exactly the same moment the plunger travels upward. 
In &lt;xref ref="bosch-fig-b"/&gt;, the ports have just closed. The fuel above the plunger is trapped and placed under high pressure by the rising plunger. The pressure forces the  delivery valve open at once, allowing the high-pressure oil to go to the spray nozzle. 
In &lt;xref ref="bosch-fig-c"/&gt;, the plunger is in the effective part of its stroke with both ports closed. Fuel is passing through the delivery valve to the spray nozzle. The effective stroke will continue as long as both ports remain covered by the plunger. 
In &lt;xref ref="bosch-fig-d"/&gt;,  the moment that the spill port is uncovered by the edge of the helix causing fuel injection to end. As soon as the port is opened, the fuel oil above the plunger flows out through the vertical slot in the plunger and goes to the low-pressure fuel oil sump. Thus, the pressure above the plunger is released and the delivery valve is returned to its seat by the valve spring.

            <Title>Construction</Title>
            <Text>An electrical generator consists of two main mechanical components: a rotating part called the rotor and a stationary part called the stator, and two main electrical components: the armature and the field.  
Both the armature and the field are made of a conducting material, usually copper wire, wound into multi-loop coils called windings. The rotor is connected to a prime mover, such as a steam turbine or a diesel engine which supplies the mechanical energy to the generator.
The field windings are like an electromagnet.  When direct current (DC) flows through the field windings, a magnetic field is created similar to the one which surrounds the north and south poles of an ordinary magnet, but adjustable. The strength of the field is controlled by the amount of the field current.  The process of supplying electrical current to the field winding is known as excitation.  
The armature windings are the part of the generator where the voltage is induced.  The armature consists of several individual windings connected in a specific configuration. The end points of the armature windings are called the generator terminals.  As long as the generator is spinning, the field will induce a sinusoidal AC voltage into the armature windings.  The armature windings deliver power to the terminals and thence to the load circuit.
In a typical AC synchronous generator, the rotor carries the field windings and the stator carries the armature windings, however the opposite arrangement is also possible.</Text>

            <Title>Periodic Waves</Title>
            <Text>A periodic waveform is a quantity, (voltage, current, power, for example) that varies in a repeating pattern over time.  Standard AC voltage takes the form of a sine wave as shown in &lt;xref ref="fig_sine-wave-definitions"/&gt;, although other shapes such as square waves and sawtooth waves are used in electronic circuits.
Periodic waveforms are characterized by several key properties that define its behavior and shape:

&lt;figure xml:id="fig_sine-wave-definitions"&gt;
 &lt;caption&gt;Periodic 60 Hz AC voltage sine wave&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;image source="images/sine-wave-definitions" width="75%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

Amplitude (Peak value): The amplitude is the maximum value reached by the waveform during each cycle. It represents the highest positive or negative value from the reference level (usually zero volts).
Frequency The frequency f of a periodic waveform is the number of complete cycles or oscillations that occur in one second. It is measured in Hertz (Hz). Frequency determines how quickly the voltage waveform repeats itself.  Standard electrical voltage in the United States is generated at 60 Hz, while 50 Hz is used in Europe and Japan.
Period The period T of a periodic wave is the time it takes for one complete cycle to occur. It is the reciprocal of frequency (T = 1 / f) and is measured in seconds.
Peak-to-Peak Value The peak-to-peak value is the difference between the maximum positive and maximum negative values in a waveform. It represents the total range of voltage variation.
Root Mean Square (RMS) Voltage The  root mean square is a mathematical concept used to represent the effective or average value of a varying quantity, such as voltage or current, in an AC waveform. It provides a way to express the magnitude of an AC signal in a manner that is equivalent to the magnitude of a DC value. 
RMS values, rather than peak or instantaneous values, are used to describe the properties of AC systems.   For example, when you see the voltage rating on a household electrical device (e.g., 120V for North America), it's the RMS value that's being specified. Similarly, the current rating (e.g., 15A) refers to the RMS value of the current.
For a sinusoidal waveform (like the standard AC power supply waveform), the RMS value is approximately 1/\sqrt{2} =  0.707 times the peak value of the waveform.  &lt;me&gt;V_{\text{RMS}} = \frac{V_{\text{peak}}}{\sqrt{2}}\qquad V_{\text{peak}} =V_{\text{RMS}}\sqrt{2}&lt;/me&gt;
The RMS value of an AC voltage is the equivalent steady DC voltage that would produce the same amount of power dissipation across a resistor as the AC voltage across the same resistor. In other words, it's the voltage that gives the same heating effect as the AC voltage. Similarly, the RMS value of an AC current is the equivalent steady DC current that would produce the same power dissipation in a resistor as the AC current through the same resistor.
Phase Shift Phase shift refers to the time difference between two periodic waveforms. It's often expressed in degrees and indicates how far one waveform is shifted in time relative to another. A phase shift of 0 degrees means the waveforms are in sync, while a phase shift of 180 degrees means they are completely out of phase.  Recall that capacitors and inductors cause a phase shift between current and voltage.

            <Title>Convection</Title>
            <Text>At the molecular or sub-molecular level, heat transfer takes place through both the processes of conduction and radiation. If we use the term &lt;q&gt;heat transfer&lt;/q&gt; in a somewhat different way, we may also include convection as a mode of heat transfer. However, it is important to understand the difference between convection and the basic heat transfer processes of conduction and radiation. 
If we put a hot brick into a wheelbarrow and wheel it across the street, we have in one sense &lt;q&gt;transferred&lt;/q&gt; heat. However, any heat transfer that takes place between the brick and its surroundings while we are wheeling it across the street will be by conduction and by radiation. Therefore, it would really be more accurate to say that we have &lt;q&gt;transported&lt;/q&gt; the brick and all its contained thermal energy from one side of the street to the other. 
Convection occurs only in fluids – liquids, gases, and vapors – not in solids, such as the brick we have just transported in the wheelbarrow. Convection is the transportation or movement of some portions of a fluid within the total mass of the fluid. As this movement occurs, the moving portions of the fluid transfer their contained thermal energy from one part of the fluid to another. The effect of convection is thus to mix the various portions of the fluid; the part that was at the bottom of the container may move to the top, or the part that was at one side may move to the other side. As this mixing takes place, heat transfer occurs from one part of the fluid to another and between the fluid and its surroundings. But this heat transfer, like any other heat transfer, takes place by conduction and by radiation. In other words, convection transports portions of the fluid; conduction and radiation transfer the thermal energy. 
Convection serves a vital purpose in bringing the different parts of the fluid into close contact so that heat transfer can occur. Without convection, there can be little heat transfer from or within fluids. Most fluids are poor conductors of heat when they are not in motion. 
What causes this transportation of a mass of fluid? In the case of &lt;em&gt;natural convection&lt;/em&gt;, the movement is caused by differences in the density of different parts of the fluid. The differences in density are usually caused by unequal temperatures within the mass of fluid. For example, as the air over a hot radiator is heated, it becomes less dense and therefore begins to rise. Cooler, heavier air is drawn in to replace the heated air, and convection currents are thus setup. Another example of natural convection is the circulation of water in a natural circulation boiler. As the water in the generating tubes is heated, it expands and becomes much lighter (less dense) than the cooler water in the downcomers. Therefore the hotter and lighter water rises, while the cooler and heavier water flows downward. The resulting circulation of water in the boiler is thus clearly an example of convection currents established by differences in temperature (and therefore differences in density) in various parts of the fluid. 
In the case of &lt;em&gt;forced convection&lt;/em&gt;, some mechanical device such as a pump or a fan produces the movement of the fluid. When the main feed pump moves feedwater toward the boiler, the water is transported by forced convection. The flow of combustion gases through a boiler is partly by natural convection and partly by forced convection. Natural convection occurs because the gases of combustion are hotter and lighter than air, so they tend to rise and go up the stack. Forced convection is also involved in this process, however, because the forced draft blowers supply an air pressure which increases the rate at which the combustion gases travel across the tubes and up the stack. When you stir a cup of hot coffee, you are forcing convection and thus increasing the rate of heat transfer. Natural convection currents would be set up in the coffee if you did not stir it, because differences in density would occur as some portions of the coffee cooled before others. If you want to cool the coffee rapidly, use forced convection (stirring). If you do not want it to cool so rapidly, wait for natural convection to do the job. 
In summary, then, we use the term convection to describe the transportation, or loosely, the &lt;q&gt;heat transfer&lt;/q&gt; of a mass of fluid and its contained thermal energy. However, the processes by which any substance gains or loses thermal energy are most accurately described in terms of conduction and radiation.

            <Title>Cylinder Sleeve or Bore</Title>
            <Text>Diesel engines use one of two types of cylinders.  
In the first type,  the cylinders are simply machined or bored into the block casting, making the block and cylinders one piece. This design if typically found in inexpensive engines.
In the second type, a machined steel sleeve, or cylinder liner,  is pressed into the block casting to form the cylinder. &lt;xref ref="cylinder-liners"/&gt;  provide examples of sleeved diesel engines. With either method, the bore or sleeve provides the engine with the cylindrical structure needed to confine the combustion gases and to act as a guide for the engine's pistons.  Sleeved liners can be easily replaced when they wear out.
&lt;figure xml:id="cylinder-liners" &gt;

 &lt;image source="images/two-stroke-liner.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/sidebyside&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
In engines using sleeves, there are two types of sleeves, wet and dry. A dry sleeve is surrounded by the metal of the block and does not come in direct contact with the engine's coolant (water). A wet sleeve comes in direct contact with the engine's coolant. 
Most diesel engines are multi-cylinder and typically have their cylinders arranged in one of two ways, an in-line or a V, although other combinations exits. In an in-line engine, as the name indicates, all the cylinders are in a row. In a V type engine the cylinders are arranged in two rows of cylinders set at an angle to each other that align to a common crankshaft.  Each group of cylinders making up one side of the V is referred to as a bank of cylinders.
The volume enclosed by the sleeve is called the combustion chamber and is the space where the fuel is burned. In either type of cylinder, sleeved or bored, the diameter of the cylinder is called the bore of the engine and is stated in inches. For example, the bore of a 350 cubic inch Chevrolet gasoline engine is 4 inches.

The capacitor imposes a phase shift on the line current reaching these windings, to make it look like two-phase AC current. The stator is thus able to develop a rotating magnetic field to drive a rotor.

            <Title>Fuel System</Title>
            <Text>All diesel engines require a method to store and deliver fuel to the engine. Because diesel engines rely on injectors which are precision components with extremely tight tolerances and very small injection hole(s), the fuel delivered to the engine must be extremely clean and free of contaminants. The fuel system must, therefore, not only deliver the fuel but also ensure its cleanliness. 
Fuel cleanliness is usually accomplished through a series of in-line filters. Commonly, the fuel will be filtered once outside the engine and then the fuel will pass through at least one more filter internal to the engine, usually located in the fuel line at each fuel injector. 
A diesel fuel system is more complex than the fuel system on a simple gasoline engine because in addition to suppling fuel for the engine, the fuel also acts as a coolant for the injectors. To meet this second purpose, diesel fuel  continuously flows through the engine's fuel system at a flow rate much higher than required to simply run the engine. The excess fuel is routed back to the fuel pump or the fuel storage tank depending on the design.  
An example of a fuel flow path is shown in &lt;xref ref="fuel-system-pic"/&gt;.

            <Text>PASCAL’S PRINCIPLE 
A change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to all portions of the fluid and to the walls of its container. 
Pascal’s principle, an experimentally verified fact, is what makes pressure so important in fluids. Since a change in pressure is transmitted undiminished in an enclosed fluid, we often know more about pressure than other physical quantities in fluids. Moreover, Pascal’s principle implies that &lt;em&gt;the total pressure in a fluid is the sum of the pressures from different sources&lt;/em&gt;. We shall find this fact—that pressures add—very useful. 
Blaise Pascal had an interesting life in that he was home-schooled by his father who removed all of the mathematics textbooks from his house and forbade him to study mathematics until the age of 15. This, of course, raised the boy’s curiosity, and by the age of 12, he started to teach himself geometry. Despite this early deprivation, Pascal went on to make major contributions in the mathematical fields of probability theory, number theory, and geometry. He is also well known for being the inventor of the first mechanical digital calculator, in addition to his contributions in the field of fluid statics. 
Application of Pascal’s Principle 
One of the most important technological applications of Pascal’s principle is found in a &lt;em&gt;hydraulic system&lt;/em&gt;, which is an enclosed fluid system used to exert forces. The most common hydraulic systems are those that operate car brakes. Let us first consider the simple hydraulic system shown in &lt;xref ref="one-cubic-inch"/&gt;

&lt;figure xml:id="one-cubic-inch"&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;1 cubic inch    A small force can be converted into a larger force when pressure is transmitted through liquids in different containers with pistons that are connected.
&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image9.jpeg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
A typical hydraulic system with two fluid-filled cylinders, capped with pistons and connected by a tube called a hydraulic line. A downward force F1F1 on the left piston creates a pressure that is transmitted undiminished to all parts of the enclosed fluid. This results in an upward force F2F2 on the right piston that is larger than F1F1 because the right piston has a larger area.

            <Text>Following the condensate pump, condensate passes through a series of heat exchangers designed recover otherwise lost heat energy and improve the efficiency of the steam cycle.
First the condensate passes through the Air Ejector Condenser.  The Air Ejector is a steam powered air pump that removes air that leaks into the condenser.  The steam used by the air ejector is condensed here, where it preheats the condensate. Any heat added before the condensate reaches the boiler represents fuel that doesn’t need to be burned, so the cycle efficiency is raised. 
&lt;figure xml:id="air_ejector_fig"&gt; &lt;caption&gt;Air Ejector and Air Ejector Condenser&lt;/caption&gt; &lt;image width="75%" source="images/air_ejector"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Next, the condensate passes through gland exhaust condenser. This unit condenses steam that leaks out of the turbine glands, and simultaneously recovers more energy and recaptures the leakage. This is an example of the way a practical cycle takes every opportunity to recover &lt;q&gt;free&lt;/q&gt; energy and increase the overall cycle efficiency
The drain cooler and first stage heater follow, in that order.   The first stage heater uses partially expanded steam to pre-heat the condensate.  This steam condenses in the first stage heater, but still is quite hot, so the remaining energy is recovered in the drain cooler. The condensed drains are returned to the system so no water is lost.
The first stage heater is an example of  regenerative feed heating, a process that improves the overall efficiency of the cycle. In regenerative heating, steam is partially expanded in the turbine to drive the propeller, then bled off at an appropriate temperature where it is used to preheat the condensate. Some shore power plants have four or more stages of regenerative heating.
The flow order through these heat exchangers is always from coolest to hottest. Therefore the air ejector and exhaust condensers come first, followed by the drain cooler, and finally the first stage heater.

            <Text>Watchstanders must continuously monitor the boiler while it is in operation to prevent small problems from becoming big problems. Most of the time, the boiler automation system works correctly and the boiler seems to take care of itself, but it only takes a small problem and a few minutes of inattention before you have a serious casualty: the boiler can overheat and melt, over-pressurize and lift safety valves, or even explode! During a boiler casualty, time is critical; the sooner a problem is detected, the easier it is to take care of. Ideally, the engineer should notice the symptoms developing and respond, long before it gets serious – even before an alarm rings. Of course, the licensed watch engineer has the primary responsibility for the safe operation of the boiler, but even a youngie can become a hero by noticing something wrong, and bringing it to his attention in time to save the plant! 
In this section, we will discuss the boiler parameters that you should watch whenever you’re in the engine room, and especially whenever you’re on watch in the control room or the fire room.

            <Title>Blowing Tubes</Title>
            <Text>Combustion gases leave ash or soot deposits on the tube surfaces which reduce heat transfer to the boiler water. Soot blowers are used to remove this soot from the tube surfaces, either using steam or high pressure compressed air to blow the soot off of the tube surfaces. Tubes are normally blown once or twice a day when at sea, before and after leaving port, and after boiler casualties which cause heavy smoke.

&lt;/figure&gt;
A steam powered rotary soot blower is shown in &lt;xref ref="sootblower_png"/&gt;. The element, a long pipe with several spray holes, is turned manually with a chain or automatically by an air powered motor. Rotating the element also turns a cam which opens the steam valve when the nozzles are pointing in the desired direction. In the design shown, the sootblower element always remains in the furnace, and must be continuously cooled or it will overheat. This is accomplished by circulating a small amount of &lt;em&gt;scavenging air&lt;/em&gt; through the element when it is not in service. The source of the scavenging air is the pressurized combustion air in the boiler double casing. A check valve installed in the scavenging line prevents steam from entering the air casing during soot blower operation. In other sootblower designs, the element can be completely retracted from the furnace and is only inserted during the soot blowing operation.

            <Title>Mass</Title>
            <Text>Mass is a fundamental property of matter that quantifies the amount of substance within an object. It is a measure of an object's resistance to acceleration when a force is applied, and it also determines the strength of its gravitational attraction to other objects. In physics, mass is typically measured in kilograms (kg) in the International System of Units (SI), or pounds (abbreviated lb.) in the US Customary system. 
The greater the mass of an object, the more force is required to accelerate or decelerate it. Mass is an intrinsic property and is independent of an object's location in space. In engineering, mass plays a crucial role in calculations related to forces, motion, energy, and structural integrity. 
Key points about mass include: 
Inertia: Mass is directly related to inertia, which is an object's resistance to changes in its state of motion. The greater the mass, the greater the force needed to accelerate or decelerate the object. An object with a larger mass would require a greater force to accelerate it and change its inertia than an object with a smaller mass. Therefore, an object's inertial mass definition is its resistance to changes in acceleration. 
Gravitational Interaction: Mass also determines the gravitational force between objects. According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, the force of attraction between two masses is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. 
Invariance: Mass is invariant, meaning it does not change regardless of the object's location or the reference frame from which it is measured. This is in contrast to weight, which can vary depending on the gravitational field strength. 
Relativity: In the theory of relativity, mass is also related to energy. According to Einstein's famous equation E=mc2E = mc^2E=mc2, mass can be converted into energy and vice versa. 
Conservation of Mass: The principle of the conservation of mass states that in a closed system, the total mass remains constant over time, regardless of the processes occurring within the system. 
In summary, mass is a measure of the quantity of matter in an object, contributing to both its inertia and its gravitational interaction with other objects. 
6.2.2 UNITS FOR MEASURING MASS 
Pound (lb.): The pound is the most commonly used unit for everyday measurements of mass in the United States. One pound is equivalent to 16 ounces. One pound is equivalent to approximately 0.453592 kilograms. 
Ounce (oz): The ounce is a smaller unit of mass often used for finer measurements. There are 16 ounces in a pound. One ounce is approximately 28.3495 grams. 
To convert units from pounds to ounces, the number of pounds is multiplied by 16. Likewise, to convert from ounces to pounds, the mass value is divided by 16.

The SI (International System of Units) 
The mass unit that is typically used in SI is the kilogram (kg). However, the kilogram is easily converted to the gram (g) when multiplied by 1,000. Similarly, the gram (g) can be converted to milligrams (mg) by multiplying by 1,000. Conversely, milligrams are converted to grams by dividing by 1,000. Similarly, grams are converted to kilograms by dividing by 1,000. 
Gram (g): The gram is a smaller unit of mass frequently used for lighter objects or more precise measurements. One kilogram is equivalent to 1,000 grams. 
Milligram (mg): The milligram is an even smaller unit used for very small masses, often in scientific and medical contexts. One gram is equivalent to 1,000 milligrams. 
Microgram (µg): The microgram is an even smaller unit used for extremely small masses, especially in fields like chemistry and pharmacology. One microgram is equivalent to 0.001 milligrams. 
These units are part of the International System of Units (SI) and provide a standardized way to express measurements of mass. The kilogram is especially important, as it is used as the base unit from which other metric units of mass are derived.

   &lt;/tabular&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
Conversions 
It is possible to convert a mass that is measured in US units to metric units and vice versa. One pound is equivalent to 453.6 grams. Thus, to convert a mass from pounds to the SI unit of kilograms, the number of pounds measured is multiplied by 453.6 grams, or 0.4536 kilograms, to determine the mass in grams. 
Using this method, one English pound is equivalent to 0.4536 kilograms. 
Conversion examples: 
1 Kilogram = 2.2 pounds 
Converting pounds to kilograms 
1-pound X \frac{1kilogram}{2.2pounds} = .45 kilograms 
Converting kilograms to grams 
0.45 kilograms x \frac{1,000grams}{1kilogram} = 450 grams 
Converting kilograms to pounds 
1-kilogram x \frac{2.2pounds}{1kilogram} = 2.2 pounds 
2-kilograms = how many pounds? 
2 kilograms x\frac{2.2pounds}{1kilogram} = 4.4 pounds 
6.2.3 INSTRUMENTS FOR MEASURING MASS 
Mass is measured by determining the extent to which a particle or object resists a change in its direction or speed when a force is applied. Isaac Newton stated: A stationary mass remains stationary, and a mass in motion at a constant speed and in a constant direction maintains that state of motion, unless acted on by an outside force. 
For a given applied force, large masses are accelerated to a small extent, and small masses are accelerated to a large extent. The mass of an object can be calculated if the force and the acceleration are known. 
The following formula applies: 
   &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; = &lt;em&gt;ma &lt;/em&gt;
where &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; is the applied force in newtons, &lt;em&gt;m&lt;/em&gt; is the mass of the object or particle in kilograms, and &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; is the resulting acceleration in meters per second squared. 
Mass is typically measured using a balance or a scale. A balance compares the mass of an unknown object to that of known masses, while a scale measures the gravitational force acting on an object. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption/&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image18.png"/&gt;
   Picture 123
&lt;/figure&gt;
How is Mass Different from Weight? 
A common misconception is that mass and weight are the same. However, weight is a measure of force and is determined by the mass of an object and its acceleration from the force of gravity exerted on it. Therefore, the weight of an object changes depending on its location and the force of gravity. For example, a person weighs more on Earth compared to the Moon or Mars. 
Mass is not relative to the force of gravity; mass is universal. A person's mass will not change on different planets or moons. Because it isn't probable or efficient to count the individual particles of matter that make up an object, it is preferable to use a balance to measure mass. A balance compares the unknown mass of an object to predetermined masses. Additionally, it is possible to determine an object's mass without a balance by using other information about the object and a subsequent formula that describes that information. Many different formulas include mass as a variable. Therefore, knowing other information about an object makes it possible to calculate the object's mass. For example: 
F= ma 
𝑚=𝐹/𝑎 
Knowing an object's weight, acceleration, or the force exerted on the object allows for the accurate determination of an object's unknown mass. 
The formula for calculating weight is: 
W=mg. 
In this equation, W is the variable for weight, m is the variable for mass, and g is the variable for acceleration due to gravity. On Earth, g is approximately 9.8 m/s/s. Like the force equation, the weight equation can be manipulated algebraically to solve for mass. In this case, the mass equation is m=W/g. 
Different mechanisms are used to measure mass and weight. Mass is measured using a balance, which requires pre-established values for grams or kilograms. Weight is measured using a scale. A scale determines the amount of force that gravity enacts on the mass of an object. A scale cannot measure mass, but mass can be calculated from a scale weight with the use of the weight equation: (W=mg). 
A person who weighs 175 pounds on a scale, experiences a force of approximately 778.44 Newtons. It is known that Earth's gravity accelerates mass at 9.8 meters per second squared. Given these variables, the weight equation is rearranged so mass is equal to weight divided by the acceleration of Earth's gravity as follows. Here's how to solve for mass using the weight formula: 
𝑚=𝑊𝑔 (𝑀𝑎𝑠𝑠=𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 x 𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑑𝑢𝑒 𝑡𝑜 𝐺𝑟𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑡𝑦) 
𝑚=778.44𝑁 x 9.8𝑚/𝑠2 
𝑚≈79.43𝑘𝑔 
Therefore, a person who weighs 175 pounds on Earth, has a calculated mass of 79.43 kilograms. 
Mass is not the same thing as weight. Weight has meaning only when an object having a specific mass is placed in an acceleration field, such as the gravitational field of the earth. Weight can vary depending on the strength of the gravitational field. At the earth's surface, a kilogram mass weighs about 2.2 pounds, for example. But on Mars, the same kilogram mass would weigh only about 0.8 pounds, and on Jupiter it would weigh roughly 5.5 pounds. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Weight vs. Mass&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image19.png"/&gt;
   Picture 124
&lt;/figure&gt;
Physics Mass Equations 
The mass of an object can be determined without the use of a balance by using a formula that has mass as a variable. In physics, a common method for how to find mass is associated with Sir Isaac Newton's second law of motion. This law describes an object's inertia and states that net force (F), measured in Newtons (N) equals mass (m) multiplied by acceleration (a), i.e., F=ma. 
The equation variables can be algebraically rearranged to solve for mass so that m=F/a. Thus, if the amount of force applied to an object and its rate of acceleration is known, the mass of the object can be calculated by dividing the force by the acceleration. 
𝐹=𝑚𝑎 
𝐹/𝑎=𝑚 
Mass can also be calculated when the weight of an object is known. 
W=mg 
How to Find Mass 
There are several options available to solve for mass. Which mass equation to use will depend on the situation and the available information. Consider the following examples using the physics mass equations. 
Example 1: Using Newton's Second Law of Motion (F=ma or m=F/a) to calculate mass. 
A force of 150 N is applied to an object which then accelerates at 3 m/s/s. What is the mass of the object? 
The example problem provides information about force and acceleration which means Newton's Second Law of Motion formula can be used (F=ma). 
The formula must be rearranged algebraically to solve for mass (m). This is done by dividing both sides of the equation by acceleration (a): 
𝐹=𝑚𝑎 
𝐹/𝑎=𝑚𝑎/𝑎 
𝐹/𝑎=𝑚 
Now the force (F) and acceleration (a) variables can be replaced by the values from the example problem: 
150𝑁/3𝑚/𝑠/𝑠=𝑚 
Finally, the value for force is divided by the value for acceleration to solve for mass: 
50𝑘𝑔=𝑚 
The object has a calculated mass of 50 kg. 
When using Newton's Second Law to solve for mass, the equation shows mass to be a proportion of the force applied to an object to its acceleration. In this relationship, if the same force is applied to an object with a mass of 100 kg and to an object with a mass of 25 kg, the object with a mass of 25 kg will have a greater acceleration. This is because the object with a greater mass would require a greater applied force to achieve an acceleration equal to an object with a smaller mass. 
Example 2: Using weight and gravitational acceleration (W=mg or m=W/g) to calculate mass, 
what is the mass of an object that weighs 150 pounds on Earth? 
The example problem provides information about the weight of an object and its location, Earth, which has a gravitational acceleration of 9.8 m/s/s. This means the weight equation can be used. 
The first step in this calculation is to convert the weight in pounds to its force in Newtons. This step can be done with an internet search or by multiplying the weight in pounds by 4.4482. Doing so provides a value of 667.2 N. 
With the weight (667.2 N) and gravitational acceleration (9.8 m/s/s) known, the values can replace the variables in the equation: 
𝑚=𝑊/𝑔 
𝑚=667.2𝑁/9.8𝑚/𝑠/𝑠 
𝑚=68.1𝑘𝑔 
The object has a calculated mass of 68.1 kg. 
The weight and gravitational acceleration equation is very similar to Newton's Second Law equation. Weight is a force and replaces the F variable from Newton's equation. Gravitational acceleration in the weight equation replaces the acceleration variable from Newton's Law and is a constant. On Earth, it is 9.8 m/s/s. Other planets and the moon have different values for gravitational acceleration. Thus, the more mass an object has, the greater the force of weight it will experience. 
What is mass equal to? 
Mass is equal to the following: 
Mass is equal to the density multiplied by volume. Mass is equal to energy divided by the speed of light squared. Mass is equal to weight divided by the acceleration of gravity. Mass is also equal to net force divided acceleration. 
What is the formula for mass and weight? 
The formula for weight states that weight is equal to mass multiplied by the acceleration of gravity (i.e., W=mg). 
The formula for mass can therefore be m=W/g. However, mass is also equal to the net force needed to accelerate an object, divided by its acceleration (i.e., M = F/A). 
How is Mass Applied in Real Life? 
Knowing and understanding how the mass of an object affects its behavior has practical applications in a variety of fields that impact everyday life including astronomy, chemistry, and engineering. 
For an astronomer, being able to determine the mass of a star provides information about how much and what type of elements it is burning for fuel along with its expected life span. Once the mass of a star is known, astronomers can use Einstein's energy equation to calculate the amount of energy produced by the star. According to experiments conducted by Albert Einstein, energy is equal to mass times the square of the speed of light. 
Chemists must know the atomic mass or the mass of individual atoms to properly and safely mix chemical compounds to formulate products such as medications, household cleaning products, fertilizers, industrial solvents, and other products used regularly by people. 
In all fields of engineering, an understanding of mass is essential, particularly as it is related to inertia and Newton's Second Law of Motion. An engineer tasked with constructing a skyscraper must understand and determine the necessary mass of the steel beams used in construction that will resist acceleration. Knowing and properly using this information will prevent the force of higher floors from crushing the lower floors of the building. 
To summarize, mass is a fundamental property of matter, and its measurement is critical in engineering. In the United States customary system, mass is measured in pounds and ounces, while the metric system uses kilograms and grams. Conversion factors are used to convert between different units. By understanding mass and its measurement in both systems, engineering students can effectively apply these concepts in their studies and future careers.

            <Text>Several types of metals are commonly used for pipes on ships due to their specific properties and suitability for marine environments. The choice of metal depends on factors such as corrosion resistance, strength, cost, and the type of fluid or gas being transported. Here are some of the metals frequently used for pipes on ships:

1. **Carbon Steel:** Carbon steel pipes are widely used in shipbuilding due to their strength and cost-effectiveness. They are suitable for conveying various fluids and gases. However, carbon steel is susceptible to corrosion in marine environments, so protective coatings or regular maintenance might be necessary.

2. **Stainless Steel:** Stainless steel is a popular choice for ship pipes because of its excellent corrosion resistance. Different grades of stainless steel are used depending on the level of corrosion resistance required and the specific fluids being transported. Types like 316 and 316L are commonly used in marine applications.

3. **Copper:** Copper pipes are often used in ship plumbing systems for carrying freshwater and certain chemicals. Copper has good corrosion resistance and is especially effective against biofouling, making it suitable for potable water systems.

4. **Nickel Alloys:** Nickel alloys, such as Monel and Inconel, are used in ship systems where resistance to high temperatures, corrosion, and stress is required. These alloys are often used in systems that handle harsh chemicals or high-temperature fluids.

5. **Aluminum:** Aluminum pipes are lightweight and corrosion-resistant, making them ideal for applications where weight reduction is crucial, such as in air conditioning and ventilation systems.

6. **Titanium:** Titanium pipes are highly corrosion-resistant and lightweight, making them suitable for seawater cooling systems and other applications where corrosion is a concern. However, titanium is more expensive than many other materials.

7. **Brass:** Brass pipes are used in certain ship systems due to their corrosion resistance, especially in areas where saltwater exposure is frequent. They are commonly used in small-scale plumbing and valve systems.

8. **Duplex Stainless Steel:** Duplex stainless steels combine the benefits of austenitic and ferritic stainless steels, offering high strength and excellent corrosion resistance. They are used in applications requiring both strength and resistance to aggressive marine environments.

9. **Galvanized Steel:** Galvanized steel pipes are coated with a layer of zinc, providing moderate corrosion resistance. They are used in systems that are exposed to moisture and water, such as ballast systems.

The choice of metal for pipes on ships depends on the specific needs of each application, regulatory requirements, and the balance between performance and cost. In critical systems, where corrosion resistance and reliability are paramount, higher-grade materials like stainless steel and nickel alloys are often preferred.</Text>

            <Title>Lift Check</Title>
            <Text>A lift check valve has a specially designed disk or ball which closes against a seat   just like a typical globe valve. In this design, the disk or ball is not attached to any   arm or stem. Since the disk is free to move away from the seat without an arm or stem to   guide it back in correct alignment to the seat upon closing, other guidance means are   employed. In most lift check valves, the disk (with higher than normal sides) or the   ball just fits into to hole in the upper part of the body. When flow pushes the disk or   ball away from the seat, the walls of the hole in the upper body guide the disk or ball   straight up away from the seat. These walls also guide the disk straight down when it is   closing assuring correct alignment between the disk and seat for tight closure.

            <Title>Pressure Gauge Construction</Title>
            <Text>A pressure gauge is a common instrument used to measure pressure in a wide range of applications. 
Bourdon Tube 
A bourdon pressure gauge is the most common type of pressure gauge and it uses a curved tube that straightens under pressure and shows the reading on a dial. The Bourdon gauge consists of a tube bent into a coil or an arc. As the pressure in the tube increases, the coil unwinds. A pointer connected to the end of the tube can be attached to a lever and a pointer calibrated to indicate pressure.

Pressure Transducer 
A pressure transducer is an electronic device that converts pressure into an electrical signal. It is often used in automated systems or where electronic data acquisition is required.

   &lt;caption&gt;Pressure Transducer&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image17.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Pressure is defined as force per unit area. Can pressure be increased in a fluid by pushing directly on the fluid? Yes, but it is much easier if the fluid is enclosed. The heart, for example, increases blood pressure by pushing directly on the blood in an enclosed system (valves closed in a chamber). If you try to push on a fluid in an open system, such as a river, the fluid flows away. An enclosed fluid cannot flow away, and so pressure is more easily increased by an applied force. 
What happens to a pressure in an enclosed fluid? Since atoms in a fluid are free to move about, they transmit the pressure to all parts of the fluid and to the walls of the container. Remarkably, the pressure is transmitted &lt;em&gt;undiminished&lt;/em&gt;. This phenomenon is called Pascal’s principle, because it was first clearly stated by the French philosopher and scientist Blaise Pascal (1623–1662): A change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to all portions of the fluid and to the walls of its container.</Text>

            <Text>Improved efficiency at low loads. Ships can secure one or more engine/generator sets if they are not needed. The remaining engines can then operate at nearly full load, resulting in improved efficiency compared to having more engines operating at part-load. Load management systems continuously monitor the electrical demand and promptly initiate the startup of an additional generator when necessary.</Text>

            <Text>Measurement is the process of associating numbers with quantities. Units of measurement establish a common language for engineers to communicate and quantify various physical quantities. In the world of engineering, measurement is fundamental. Accurate measurements are crucial for designing, constructing, and evaluating systems. Engineers rely on standardized units and principles of measurement to ensure consistency and precision in their work.
There are two basic standard units of measurement systems that are used worldwide, the U.S. Standard Measurement System and the Metric System.
This chapter provides an overview of important qualities and units of measurement used in engineering, covering both the metric and US standard systems as well as nautical measurement. An overview of basic instruments used for making measurements will be discussed along with a discussion and examples of methods of unit conversion.
As you study this chapter, you will encounter new terms and definitions for you to learn. At the end of the chapter, you will find example problems. Be sure to take the time to practice with these problems. They will help prepare you to apply these concepts.

            <Title>Gage Calibration</Title>
            <Text>Gage calibration involves comparing a gauge's readings against a known standard or reference to ensure accuracy and correct any discrepancies. Gages are initially calibrated at the factory, but they should also be recalibrated at regular intervals.  Recalibration helps to detect and correct drift, wear, or damage in the gauge, thus ensuring reliable performance. The frequency of recalibration depends on factors such as the gauge’s usage, the criticality of the measurements, and manufacturer recommendations.
Two adjustments are usually made when performing a calibration.  
Zero Adjustment: This is typically done first. The gauge is checked at no pressure, and adjustments are made to set the pointer at zero. This ensures that the gauge has no offset error.
Span Adjustment: After setting the zero point, the gauge is subjected to its maximum rated pressure to check the upper end of the scale. Adjustments are then made to ensure that the gauge reads accurately at this high-pressure point. This process might also include intermediate points to verify linearity across the span.

            <Title>Power</Title>
            <Text>During the power stroke, the expanding gases force the piston down and drive the load. 
Both intake and exhaust valves are closed, and the fresh air charge has been compressed. The fuel has been injected and is starting to burn. After the piston passes TDC, heat is rapidly released by the ignition of the fuel, causing a rise in cylinder pressure. Combustion temperatures are around 2336°F. This rise in pressure forces the piston downward and increases the force on the crankshaft. 
The energy generated by the combustion process is not all harnessed. In a two stroke diesel engine, only about 38% of the generated power is harnessed to do work, about 30% is wasted in the form of heat rejected to the cooling system, and about 32% in the form of heat is rejected out the exhaust. In comparison, the four-stroke diesel engine has a thermal distribution of 42% converted to useful work, 28% heat rejected to the cooling system, and 30% heat rejected out the exhaust.

            <Title>Time Measuring Instruments</Title>
            <Text>Solar Day and Sundials: One of the earliest methods of measuring time is based on the solar day—the time it takes for the Earth to complete one rotation on its axis relative to the sun. Ancient cultures, such as the Egyptians and Babylonians, observed the motion of the sun's shadow to create sundials. These sundials divided the day into various parts based on the position of the sun. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Sundial&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image23.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Instruments like clocks and watches are used to measure and quantify time intervals. These devices are based on various mechanisms, such as pendulums, gears, or electronic oscillators. 
Today highly accurate timekeeping instruments set the beat for most of our electronic devices. Nearly all computers, for example, contain a quartz-crystal clock to regulate their operation. Moreover, not only do time signals beamed down from Global Positioning System satellites calibrate the functions of precision navigation equipment, but they do so as well for cellular telephones, instant stock-trading systems, and nationwide power-distribution grids. So integral have these time-based technologies become to our day-to-day lives that we recognize our dependency on them only when they fail to work. 
Clocks, both analog and digital, are widely used to measure time. Analog clocks typically have hands that move around a circular dial, indicating hours, minutes, and sometimes seconds. Digital clocks display time using numerical digits. 
Watches are portable timekeeping devices that individuals can wear on their wrists. They come in various styles, including analog, digital, and smartwatches, which offer additional functionalities beyond timekeeping. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Watches&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image10.jpeg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
An Hourglass consists of two glass bulbs connected by a narrow neck, with sand flowing through the neck. The time it takes for the sand to flow from one bulb to the other provides an estimate of a specific duration. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Hourglass&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image11.jpeg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
A Chronometer is a highly accurate timekeeping instrument, often used in navigation. Marine chronometers, for example, are designed to provide accurate timekeeping on ships. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Chronometer&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image12.jpeg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Atomic Clocks use the vibrations of atoms (usually cesium or rubidium) to measure time with extraordinary precision. These clocks form the basis for International Atomic Time (TAI) and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Atomic Clock&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image13.jpeg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
A stopwatch is a handheld timekeeping device used to measure elapsed time. It typically has buttons to start, stop, and reset the timing. 
Pendulum Clocks use the swinging motion of a pendulum to regulate the passage of time. These clocks were commonly used in the past for accurate timekeeping. 
Quartz Clocks use the vibrations of a quartz crystal to regulate time. They are commonly found in both analog and digital formats. 
Smartphones and Computers often include built-in clocks. These devices can synchronize with atomic clocks and provide accurate timekeeping. 
Nautical-Specific Time Measurements: Navigators and sailors have relied on specific time measurements to ensure safe and accurate maritime journeys. Two notable nautical-specific time measurements are: 
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is the mean solar time at the Prime Meridian, located at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England. Historically, GMT served as the standard reference time for navigation and was essential for calculating longitude accurately. 
Nautical Time: In the past, sailors aboard ships used nautical time to simplify timekeeping during their journeys. The day was divided into six four-hour watches, each indicated by the number of bells struck on the ship's bell. This system allowed for continuous operation and ensured crew members knew when to be on duty. 
The choice of timekeeping instrument depends on factors such as accuracy requirements, portability, and intended use. Atomic clocks, based on the vibrations of atoms, are among the most accurate timekeeping devices developed to date. 
The history of time measurement is a fascinating subject, from the ancient sundials to the modern atomic clocks. Today, the most accurate time measurement is based on the behavior of atoms. The definition of a second as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium-133 atom is now the universally accepted standard. It is amazing to think that the behavior of an atom can be used to measure time with such incredible accuracy.

            <Text>In addition to measuring the amount of fuel injected, the system must properly time the injection to ensure efficient combustion so that maximum energy can be obtained from the fuel. When fuel is injected too early into the cylinder, it may cause the engine to detonate and lose power, and have low exhaust temperatures. If the fuel is injected late into the cylinder, it will cause the engine to have high exhaust temperatures, smoky exhaust, and a loss of power. In both situations, fuel economy will be low and fuel consumption will be high.</Text>

            <Title>Loss of lube oil pressure</Title>
            <Text>Lube oil system casualties, including loss of lube oil pressure, high bearing temperatures, and lube oil system leaks are very serious and can result in extensive damage to the main engine bearings and gears.  This damage will immobilize the ship and will be very expensive to repair. 

The lube oil system is designed with safety features and redundancy to enable the operator to secure the main engine and avoid or minimize this damage. Normally the *Kennedy* is operated with an electrically driven main lube oil pump backed up by a turbine driven stand-by pump, or vice-versa.  The stand-by pump is arranged to automatically start on the loss of pressure at the main pump discharge.   Both pumps discharge to the lube oil gravity tank, which maintains a constant oil pressure on the bearings and has enough capacity to supply the system with oil for three minutes after the failure of both pumps.  At the same time, the main engine governor responds to low oil pressure by tripping the low pressure relay on the  throttles which closes the ahead throttle and stops the engine. 

The first indication of a low lube oil pressure casualty will be the sounding of the low lube oil pressure alarm, triggered by a loss of the main lube oil pump's discharge pressure.  At this point the stand-by pump should automatically start and maintain normal bearing pressures.  

During a lube oil casualty, the lube oil gravity tank *bull's eye* is an important indication of the system's "health."  As long as either lube oil pump is working, oil will overflow from the gravity tank and be visible in the bull's eye, and the bearings will be supplied with adequate lubrication.  If no oil flow is visible there, it means that neither pump is supplying oil, in which case immediate action must be taken.  Oil pressure gages at the lube oil header, bearing temperatures, and the lube oil bubblers at each bearing should be watched carefully during a casualty to help gage the extent of the damage.

Some possible causes of lube oil failure include:

-	Lube oil pump failure due to electrical or mechanical causes.
-	A leak in in the lube oil suction line, or in the suction strainer cover, causing the pump to lose suction.  Never  change over suction strainers while the lube oil system is operating.  Note: the *Kennedy* does not have a LO suction strainer.
-	A restriction in either the suction or discharge strainer.
-	Relief valve failure, preventing the pump from developing sufficient pressure.
-	A low or empty lube oil sump, which could be due to:
	-	a leak in the lube oil cooler.
	-	incorrect line up of the lube oil purifier causing the sump to be pumped out or,
	-	a leak on the discharge side of the lube oil pump.

* Gauge Adapter
A gauge adapter is used for fitting pressure gauges and instrumentation fittings. They are used for the fitting of pressure measuring instrument such as pressure gauges, gauge cocks, shut off valves etc. The different types of gauge adapters are male – female adapters, female – female adapters, male – male adapters, self sealing nipples, LH-RH unions, union nut with nipple, compression fitting with ferrule, swivel adapters etc.
* Reducing Adapter
A reducing adapter is used for joining a pipe to a hose or tube as well as to help in flow control.
In doing so it controls the pressure acting on the hose at the end. It is used in applications where a copper tube is joined to the main steam pipe for trace heating. These are the main types of pipe fittings. However, there are many more types. In the next article we shall continue discussing about various pipe fittings.
 * Hose Adapter
A hose adapter is used where a hose is connected to a pipe. It may be the termination of the piping like a garden hose at the end or a high rating hydraulic hose used to give flexibility and movability to the system</Text>

            <Text>&lt;term&gt;Safety Shoes and Boots.&lt;/term&gt; Safety shoes and boots are available in many styles depending on the job requirements. Boots provide more protection than shoes from chemicals and molten metals splashes and spark hazards, but they are heavier. Some protective features that are available in both boots and shoes include: &lt;ul&gt;
Oil resistant shoes 
Chemical resistant shoes 
Heat resistant shoes 
Slip and skid resistant shoes 
Waterproof and water resistant shoes 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Steel-Reinforced Safety Shoes and Boots Similar to safety shoes, these have the toe box and insole reinforced with steel, and the instep reinforced with steel, aluminum, or plastic. These shoes will protect your feet from falling objects and puncture injuries. 
Composite-Toe Safety Shoes Composite-toe shoes have a protective cap made of non-metallic materials such as carbon fiber, Kevlar, or fiberglass. They offer lightweight protection and are ideal for environments where metal detection is required or in situations where electrical conductivity needs to be minimized.
Electrically Insulated Safety Shoes These shoes have non-conductive soles to prevent the wearer’s feet from completing an electrical circuit to ground. They can protect workers against as much as 600 volts in dry conditions. These shoes should be used in conjunction with insulated tools and precautions to reduce or eliminate the potential for providing a path for hazardous electrical energy. Non-conductive footwear must not be used in explosive or hazardous locations; in such locations, electrically conductive shoes are required. 
Electrically Conductive Safety Shoes These shoes protect against the buildup of static electricity. Essentially, these shoes ground the employees wearing them. Employees working in explosive and hazardous locations such as explosives manufacturing facilities or grain elevators must wear conductive shoes to reduce the risk of static electricity buildup on an employee’s body that could produce a spark and cause an explosion or fire. During training, employees must be instructed not to use foot powder or wear socks made of silk, wool, or nylon with conductive shoes. Foot powder insulates and retards the conductive ability of the shoes. Silk, wool, and nylon produce static electricity. Conductive shoes are not general-purpose shoes and must be removed upon completion of the tasks for which they are required. Employees exposed to electrical hazards must &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; wear conductive shoes.

            <Title>Threaded Connections</Title>
            <Text>In a threaded pipe connection, matching male and female threads are screwed together to create a secure and leak-resistant joint.  Threaded pipe connections are widely used in plumbing systems, natural gas lines, water supply systems, &lt;etc/&gt; because they are relatively easy to fabricate and assemble; however they are not suitable for high pressure systems, nor for connections that are frequently taken apart.
Standards were first developed about 200 years ago to define the shape and tolerances of threads used for pipes and pipe fittings in order to ensure compatibility and interchangeability between different components in piping systems.  Although various standards currently exist, the National Pipe Tapered (NPT) standard is the one most commonly used in the United States.  NPTM and NPTF are abbreviations for NPT-Male and NPT-Female threads.
Unlike the straight threads used for nuts and bolts, NPT pipe threads are tapered; that is, they are formed on a conical surface.  This conical surface  tapers at an angle of  1.789^\circ = 1^\circ 47’, which is equivalent to 1⁄16 inch per inch of length.
&lt;figure xml:id="fig_npt_threads" &gt;
&lt;caption&gt;   NPT Threads  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;image width="50%" source="images/npt_threads.png"&gt;
&lt;remix&gt; &lt;source&gt; https://www.wermac.org/flanges/flanges_pipe-connections_pipe-flanges.html  &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/remix&gt;
&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Because of the taper, a pipe thread can only screw into a fitting so far before it jams. The standard specifies this distance as the length of hand tight engagement, the distance the pipe thread can be screwed in by hand. It also specifies another distance – the effective thread, this is the length of the thread which makes the seal on a conventional machined pipe thread. For workers, instead of these distances, it is more convenient to know how many turns to make by hand and how many with a wrench. A simple rule of thumb for installing tapered pipe threads, both metal and plastic, is finger tight plus one to two turns with a wrench.
Tapered threads rely on the deformation of the pipe material to form a secure seal.  If they are properly aligned, screwed together using a pipe sealant, and not over-tightened, they will create a rigid and leak-free connection. However, they cannot be taken apart and put back together too many times before the threads will permanently wear out and leak.</Text>

            <Title>Pressure Unit Conversions</Title>
            <Text>In interpreting pressure measurements, a great deal of confusion arises because the zero point on most pressure gages represents atmospheric pressure rather than zero absolute pressure, and several different pressure and head scales are used. Thus it is important to specify the kind of pressure being measured under given conditions as well as the desired units.
To clarify the numerous meanings of the word pressure, the relationship among gage pressure, atmospheric pressure, vacuum, and absolute pressure is illustrated in &lt;xref ref="PressureRelations"/&gt;. 
&lt;figure xml:id="PressureRelations"&gt; &lt;caption&gt;Pressure Relationship&lt;/caption&gt; &lt;image source="images/pressure_relationships" width="75%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
If you can remember these values, which are all equivalent expressions for atmospheric pressure, you can use them to create unit-factors as needed.
&lt;mdn&gt;
&lt;mrow  xml:id='atmos' &gt;P_\text{atm} \amp = 1 \text{ atm} = 14.7 \text{ psi} = 101.3 \textrm{ kPa} =1.01 \textrm{ bar}\\ \amp= 29.92 \textrm{ in Hg} = 760 \textrm{ mm Hg} = 33.9 \textrm{ ft H}_2\textrm{O}&lt;/mrow&gt;
&lt;/mdn&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
Absolute pressure measures up from zero.
Gage pressure measures up or down from atmospheric pressure.
Vacuum measures down from atmospheric pressure.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;md&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt;P_\text{abs}   \amp =  P_\text{atm} + P_\text{gage}&lt;/mrow&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt;P_\text{gage}  \amp =  P_\text{abs} - P_\text{atm}&lt;/mrow&gt;

            <Text>Air, which is all around you, has weight, and it presses against everything it touches. This pressure is called atmospheric pressure, or air pressure. Atmospheric pressure is the force exerted on a surface by the air above it as gravity pulls it to Earth. Atmospheric pressure is the pressure exerted by the Earth's atmosphere at a given location. Elevation affects atmospheric pressure. For example, standard atmospheric pressure at sea level is approximately 14.7 psia or 101.325 kPa. In Denver, Colorado, atmospheric pressure is 12.4 psia or about 84.0 kPa, and in Death Valley, California it is 14.9 psia or 102.6 kPa. Atmospheric pressure is commonly measured with a barometer.

            <Title>Horsepower</Title>
            <Text>Engines are commonly rated by the power, torque and speed.
Power output of an engine is commonly rated in units of horsepower.  Recall that power is the amount of work done per unit time or the rate of doing work, and that: &lt;me&gt;1 \text{ hp} = 33,000 \frac{\text{ft-lb}}{\text{min}} = 746 \text{ W}&lt;/me&gt;
Torque describes the twisting force produced by the engine. Torque is commonly given in units of lb-ft.
Speed is the rotational speed of the shaft, commonly measured in revolutions per minute (rpm).  Torque and speed are commonly presented as functions of speed in a torque-speed curve.
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Engine Specs, typical&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;image source="images/GM-LSA-V8-specs" width="75%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Indicated horsepower is the power transmitted to the pistons by the gas in the cylinders and is mathematically calculated. 
Brake horsepower refers to the amount of usable power delivered by the engine to the end crankshaft. Indicated horsepower can be as much as 15% higher than brake horsepower. The difference is due to internal engine friction, combustion inefficiencies, and parasitic losses, for example, oil pump, blower, water pump, etc. 
The brake power produced by an engine can be calculated from using the formula:&lt;men xml:id="tau-n"&gt;P  = \frac{T n}{5252}&lt;/men&gt; Where: &lt;ul marker=""&gt;
P is the shaft power in horsepower (hp). 
T is the torque generated by the engine, measured in ft lb.
n is the rotational speed of the engine in rpm.
5252 is the conversion factor \left[5252 \dfrac{\text{ft lb rpm}}{\text{hp}}\right]
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The ratio of an engine's brake horsepower and its indicated horsepower is called the mechanical efficiency of the engine. The mechanical efficiency of a four-cycle diesel is about 82 to 90 percent. This is slightly lower than the efficiency of the two-cycle diesel engine. The lower mechanical efficiency is due to the additional friction losses and power needed to drive the piston through the extra two strokes.

Lobe pumps operate on the same principle as gear pumps. There are two rotors turning in the pump chamber operating through timing gears on the shafts outside the pump chamber. Most rotors are fitted with two to three lobes (similar to large gear teeth) to push fluid from the suction to the discharge side of the pump. Although the design will handle both liquids or gases, they are more commonly found pumping gases. A common application is an air pump to supply or increase the air flow to diesel and gasoline engines as part of the system necessary to make them run or increase the horsepower of the engine. In most cases they are considered high volume, low pressure pumps.

            <Title>Head Pressure</Title>
            <Text>Head Pressure 
Head pressure pertains to the pressure exerted by a fluid due to the weight of the fluid a vertical distance above a certain reference point. 
It is commonly measured in meters (m) or feet (ft). Essentially, head pressure represents the potential energy that a fluid possesses, which can be converted into work or kinetic energy. 
A vertical column of water 2.31 feet high exerts one pound of force over one square inch. 
When measuring head pressure, the specific gravity of a fluid must be included. Specific gravity is a measure of the density of a substance in comparison to the density of water. 
The Specific Gravity of fresh water equals 1. 
Pressure/Head Conversion Formula 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;The weight of one cubic foot of fresh water is of 62.427 pounds.&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image7.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;The weight of one cubic foot of fresh water is of 62.427 pounds.&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image6.jpeg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
A column of water one foot high distributed over one square inch = .433 psi 
What this relationship is saying is that for every foot we go up in height, we add 0.433 pounds per square inch at the base of an object. Or we multiply the height of the water by 0.433. Keep in mind that we are talking about water here and specifically the density and weight of water. Other liquids will have their own density, and therefore the psi at the bottom of a column of another liquid would be different than that of water. 
Example problems: 
A column of water 10 ft high exerts what pressure? 
Answer___________________ 
A Column of water 100 ft high exerts what pressure? 
Answer___________________ 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Column of water one foot high&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image8.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
For columns of water less than one foot, we multiply the height in inches by .036 psi. 
There are 12 inches in 1 foot, therefore \frac{.433psiperfoot}{12inchesperfoot} = .036 psi 
One Inch of Water = .036 psi. 
A column of water 12 inches high exerts what pressure? 
Answer____________________ 
A column of water 6 inches high exerts what pressure? 
Answer___________________ 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;One Cubic Inch of Fresh Water&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image9.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
A column of water 2.31 feet in height gives us a pressure at the base of 1 psi. 

   \frac{1poundofwaterequalswhatverticaldistance?}{1footofwaterexerts.433psi} = \frac{1psiwater}{.433\frac{psi}{foot}/water} =\frac{1psi}{.433psi} = 2.31 feet of water exerts one pound force

            <Text>Many different units are used to describe pressure. The simplest pressure units are ones that indicate how much force is applied to an area of a certain size. These units include pounds per square inch, pounds per square foot, newtons per square meter.  Other pressure units such as  pascals, atmospheres, or, bars are defined in terms of the base units of force and area. In the US we most commonly use pounds per square inch (psi), but aboard the training ship bars are most common.

            <Title>Time Units</Title>
            <Text>The units of time in use throughout the world are: 
Second (s): The second is the base unit of time in the SI system. It was historically defined as 1⁄86400 of a day – this factor derived from the division of the day first into 24 hours, then to 60 minutes per hour and finally to 60 seconds per minute (24 × 60 × 60 = 86400 seconds per day). This definition is not sufficiently accurate for many purposes because of irregularities in the earth's orbit around the sun, so the second is now formally defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation produced by the cesium-133 atom. 
For time intervals smaller than a second,  SI prefixes are used.  One millisecond is 10^{-3} seconds; 1 microsecond is 10^{-6} seconds; 1 nanosecond is 10^{-9} seconds; and 1 picosecond is 10^{-12} seconds.
Minute (min): One minute is equal to 60 seconds. 
Hour (h): One hour is equal to 60 minutes or 3,600 seconds. 
Day (d): One day is defined as 24 hours, or 86,400 seconds. It is based on the Earth's rotation period. 
Week: A week consists of seven days. 
Month: Months are somewhat arbitrary units of time that vary in length. The most common definitions are the calendar months, which have 28, 30, or 31 days. 
Year (yr): A year is the time it takes for Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun. It is approximately 365.25 days. Decade: A decade is a period of ten years. 
Century: A century is a period of one hundred years. 
Millennium: A millennium is a period of one thousand years. 
These units provide a way to express and measure various durations, from tiny fractions of a second to vast spans of time.

            <Title>Types of Torque</Title>
            <Text>Static Torque is required to initiate movement from a standstill or to stop an already moving object. It is the torque required to overcome the inertia of a stationary object and start its rotation, or to overcome static friction such as when breaking loose a bolt.
Correct torque is crucial for bolted flanges to ensure a secure and leak-free connection. Applying the proper torque to the bolts on a flange ensures that the gasket is properly compressed, which prevents leaks and maintains the integrity of the joint.  Torque is related to bolt tightness, but many additional factors, such as friction, can have a significant impact on the relationship of torque to the tightness of the bolted joint.
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Static Torque: Turning a bolt&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/torque-on-bolt.png"/&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;

Dynamic Torque refers to the twisting force that maintains an object’s constant rotational motion once it has started moving. This type of torque is used to accelerate or decelerate a moving object, such as a wheel or a motor. It’s the torque necessary to keep an object spinning at a steady rate, overcoming any frictional forces acting against it. Dynamic Torque is often used in the context of continually operating systems, like turbines in a power plant or motors in electric appliances.

            <Text>Emergency Converter Control 
Each converter is fitted with a Local emergency Operating Panel (LOP) which is directly connected to the power electronic controller PLC. 
If the propulsion remote control system fails (a link failure between PPC and PECe, or all remote control stations failed), the propulsion can be operated from the actual converters in ‘StandaloneMode’ using the LOP. Thisf acility is usually for maintenance via r service engineers or trained operators. 
local operation allows running of the motor with the minimum security conditions (only those regarding the converter itself) and the operator must check that all conditions are fulfilled to run the equipment properly, (ie, manual start of the required auxiliaries). 
At the LOP, the operator can :
• Control the cooling pumps.
• Start the converter power sequence.
• Set a speed set point.
• Read/reset faults.
• Read the converter main measurements. 
When the standalone mode is selected at the master converter, control is automatically transferred by the PPC to the LOCAL remote control station. So, when the standalone mode is released from the LOP, the control of the propulsion is at the LOCAL remote control station. 
If standalone mode is selected at the slave converter, the active remote control station does not change (the slave converter receives its torque set point from the master converter). 
In standalone mode, the motors can only be controlled in ‘Speed’ mode only, there is no Power mode.

            <Text>Batteries are electro-chemical, direct-current power supplies.  Batteries store and deliver electrical energy through a chemical reaction. Batteries consist of several electro-chemical cells, each containing an anode, cathode, and electrolyte. 
When connected to a circuit, the anode releases electrons into the external circuit, while the cathode absorbs them, generating an electrical current.  Each cell creates around 1.5 volts depending on the battery chemistry.
The chemical energy stored in a battery is finite, and is measured as its ampere-hour capacity. As current is drawn from the battery the chemical energy is depleted, at which time the battery must be replaced or when possible, recharged.  
Wet cell batteries contain a liquid electrolyte that is typically a mixture of water and sulfuric acid.  Lead-acid batteries are the most common type of wet cell. Wet-cell batteries are used where large power capacity is required, such as for uninterruptible power supplies and for starting small engines. 
Dry cell batteries contain an electrolyte in a solid, semi-solid, or gel-like state.  Alkaline, nickel-cadmium (Nicad), lithium-ion, and nickel-metal hydride batteries are all dry cells. Dry cells are commonly used for low-power purposes, such as flashlights and portable equipment.
The state of charge of a battery usually cannot be determined easily or accurately. For lead-acid batteries the approximate charge is determined by measuring the density of the electrolyte with a hydrometer, while the approximate charge of the Nicad batteries is determined by measuring the cell voltage.

            <Title>Pressurizing and Distribution of Fuel</Title>
            <Text>Before injection can be effective, the fuel pressure must be sufficiently higher than that of the combustion chamber to overcome the compression pressure. The high pressure also ensures penetration and distribution of the fuel in the combustion chamber. Proper dispersion is essential if the fuel is to mix thoroughly with the air and to bum efficiently. While pressure is a prime contributing factor, the dispersion of the fuel is influenced, in part, by atomization and penetration of the fuel. (Penetration is the distance through which the fuel particles are carried by the kinetic energy imparted to them as they leave the injector or nozzle. Friction between the fuel and the air in the combustion space absorbs this energy.) 
If the atomization process reduces the size of the fuel particles too much, they will lack penetration. Lack of sufficient penetration results in ignition of the small particles of fuel before they have been properly distributed or dispersed in the combustion space. Since penetration and atomization tend to oppose each other, a degree of compromise in each is necessary in the design of fuel injection equipment, particularly if uniform distribution of fuel within the combustion chamber is to be obtained. The pressure required for efficient injection and, in turn, proper dispersion is dependent on the compression pressure in the cylinder, the size of the opening through which the fuel enters the combustion space, the shape of the combustion space, and the amount of turbulence created in the combustion space. 
To control an engine means to keep it running at a desired speed, either in accordance with, or regardless of, the changes in the load carried by the engine. The degree of control required depends upon two factors: the engine's performance characteristics, and the type of load which it drives. 
In diesel engines, a varying amount of fuel is mixed with a constant amount of compressed air inside the cylinder. A full charge of air enters the cylinder during each intake event. The amount of fuel injected into the cylinders controls combustion and thus determines the speed and power output of a diesel engine. A governor is provided to regulate the flow of fuel. 
Other devices, either integral with the governor or mounted separately on the engine, are used to control overspeed or overload.</Text>

Good conductors are materials that have low resistance because their electrons are loosely bound to their atoms.  Copper, aluminum, silver, and gold, are all good conductors.

&lt;/sidebyside&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Three methods are commonly used to describe the size of wires and electrical conductors. 
The American Wire Gage (AWG) system assigns a specific number to each wire size, with lower numbers representing larger wires. The system is widely used in the United States for copper and  aluminum wires. For example, a common household electrical wire might be designated as 12 AWG or 14 AWG. Smaller numbers indicate thicker wires with larger cross-sectional area, capable of carrying higher current loads. Larger numbers represents thinner wires.
The Metric system simply uses the cross-sectional area of the wire measured in square millimeters (\text{mm}^2). For instance, you might see a wire labeled as 2.5 \text{ mm}^2 or 4.0 \text{ mm}^2. A larger number indicates a larger cross-sectional area and, therefore, a thicker wire capable of carrying more current.
Circular mils. This system is used in the United States when discussing very small or very large wire sizes. The term circular mil is often abbreviated as CM. The circular mil is defined as the area of a circle with a diameter of one mil, where one mil is a unit of length equal to one thousandth of an inch (0.001 inch).
Mathematically, the formula for calculating the circular mil area, A, of a wire with diameter, d, in mils is &lt;me&gt;A = \frac{d^2}{4} \text{ circular mils}&lt;/me&gt;.
For example, if you have a wire with a diameter of 500 mils, you can calculate its circular mil area as follows: &lt;me&gt;A = \frac{500^2}{4} = 125,000 \text{ circular mils}&lt;/me&gt;

            <Text> &lt;em&gt;Adapted from Principles of Naval Engineering&lt;/em&gt; The process of generating steam is basically simple. You boil water and continue to add heat until the water turns into steam. But how can this steam cause a ship to move through the water? How can steam provide power for steering, ventilation, refrigeration, distillation of seawater, and all the other needs of the vessel? 
Steam does not do any of these things directly. But some of the thermal energy contained in the steam can be converted into other forms of energy to move the ship through the water and to provide power for vital shipboard services. 
In this chapter we will discuss some basic ideas of energy and some of the important energy transformations that occur in the engineering plant of a steam-driven ship. Study this chapter carefully. The information given here will not help you to light off a boiler, clean firesides, stand a watch, or wipe up oil from the floorplates; however, it will help you to understand the generation of steam, the use of steam in the shipboard engineering plant, and the relationship of the boilers to the rest of the engineering plant. Understanding the information given in this chapter will also give you a sound background for understanding some of the more complicated things that you will have to learn as you advance. 
As you study this chapter, watch out for unfamiliar definitions. Many of the words and terms used will be familiar to you, but the definitions we use may be more precise than the ones you have heard before. Be sure that you understand the exact meaning of each word and term used in connection with energy and energy transformations. </Text>

            <Title>Introduction</Title>
            <Text>A diesel engine is a type of internal combustion engine that converts the chemical energy of fuel into work by compressing air to a high pressure and temperature, then injecting fuel into the compressed air. The heat from the compressed air ignites the fuel, causing a controlled explosion that drives a piston down. The downward motion is mechanically converted to rotary motion by a connecting rod and crankshaft.
Diesel engines provide a rugged, efficient, versatile, self-contained source of power. These engines come in sizes ranging from a few horsepower to over 100,000. Within the limits of its range of horsepower, the diesel engine is one of the most efficient source of power available. 
Diesels are widely used in a wide variety of commercial and industrial applications including electrical generation. In the field of transportation, they power locomotives, construction equipment, vehicles, and all varieties of oceangoing vessels. 
Diesel engines can operate on a wide variety of liquid fuel oils. Most small and medium engines operate on petroleum diesel fuel, which is a distilled from crude oil, while large slow speed marine engines operate on Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO). There is a growing trend for engines to run on gaseous fuels such as natural gas or bio-gas.  Engines which can operate on a combination of liquid and gaseous fuels are called dual-fuel.

            <Title>Pipe Thread</Title>
            <Text>Pipe thread standards are standardized specifications that define the characteristics of threaded connections used in pipes and pipe fittings. These standards ensure compatibility and interchangeability between different components in piping systems. There are several pipe thread standards used around the world, each with its own characteristics and applications. Here are some of the most common pipe thread standards:


1. **NPT (National Pipe Thread):**
   - NPT is a widely used thread standard in the United States and Canada.
   - There are two main types: NPT (Tapered) and NPTF (Dryseal).
   - NPT threads are tapered, which helps create a seal by wedging the threads together as the fittings are tightened.
   - NPTF threads have modified shapes to improve sealing without the need for thread sealants.

2. **BSPT (British Standard Pipe Thread):**
   - BSPT is a common thread standard in the United Kingdom and many countries that were part of the British Empire.
   - BSPT threads are also tapered, like NPT threads.
   - Common types include BSPT (Tapered) and BSPP (Parallel or Straight).

3. **BSPP (British Standard Pipe Parallel):**
   - BSPP threads are parallel or straight threads used in conjunction with BSPT threads.
   - BSPP threads do not create a tight seal without the use of additional sealing methods.

4. **BSPF (British Standard Pipe Fitting):**
   - BSPF threads are used in specialized fittings and require the use of a sealing washer to create a seal.

5. **Metric Thread Standards:**
   - ISO 7-1 (BSP) and ISO 228-1 (BSPT) are metric thread standards used in various countries.
   - These standards are commonly used in Europe and other regions where the metric system is prevalent.

6. **G (German) Thread Standard:**
   - The DIN 3852-1 standard defines the G thread, which is a parallel thread used in Germany and some other European countries.

7. **JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) Thread:**
   - JIS threads are used in Japan and other countries that follow Japanese industrial standards.
   - These threads are often found in specialized applications and components.

8. **UN/UNF Thread Standards:**
   - Unified National (UN) and Unified National Fine (UNF) thread standards are widely used in the United States for various applications, including pipes and fittings.

9. **API (American Petroleum Institute) Thread Standards:**
   - API thread standards, such as API 5B and API 5C, are used specifically in the petroleum industry for oil and gas pipes and equipment.

It's important to choose the correct thread standard for your application to ensure proper fit, sealing, and functionality of the piping system. Mismatched threads can lead to leaks, inefficiencies, and other issues. Always refer to relevant standards and guidelines when selecting and using pipe threads and fittings.</Text>

            <Title>Low water in boiler</Title>
            <Text>One of the most serious casualties you may encounter is low water in the boiler. It is essential that you always maintain a water level in the boiler, or risk serious tube damage or even a boiler explosion.  The boiler gage glasses are designed to span the safe operating range of the boiler water level. If water ever goes out of sight in the glass, the boiler must be secured immediately until the cause can be determined and rectified. Multiple water level indicators and high and low level alarms should give sufficient warning before serious damage occurs.  The main fuel oil solenoids will close and shut off fuel to the boiler upon receiving a low-low level alarm.
A low water casualty can occur gradually or suddenly, and can affect one or both boilers.   The onset of the condition may give you some clues as to the cause of the problem. For example, if both boiler are dropping the problem is probably with the feedwater supply.  If only only one boiler is affected, the problem lies with the feedwater regulator or feed line, or within the boiler.
Low water can be caused by:

*	Incorrect Set Points -- If the feed pump governor or the feedwater regulator system automatic settings are incorrect they can be corrected by judicious adjustment. If the load on the boiler changes significantly it may be necessary to manually adjust these set points. 
* 	Low Feed Pump Discharge Pressure -- This situation can be caused by a number of problems. Among the possibilities: low steam pressure to the feed pump, high auxiliary exhaust pressure, the feed pump recirc line open too wide, or the feed pump discharge recirculating back to the DC heater through the idle feed pump. Low auxiliary exhaust pressure, or low DC heater level may cause the hot feedwater at the pump suction to flash to steam, resulting in the pump overspeeding and tripping out. An empty DC heater will starve the feed pump. In any of these events, the root cause must be corrected and pump discharge pressure restored before the water level in the boiler drops out of sight. 
* 	Feed pump failure -- If the feed pump shaft or bearings fail the pump will quickly come to a stop, and the watch engineer must bring the stand-by unit into service before the water level in the boilers is lost.
*	Boiler Tube Failure -- Tube failure may be the cause of low water in the boiler, or it may be the result, because the operator has let the water level get too low and tubes have overheated. In either case the boiler must be secured immediately. See the procedure for forced boiler shutdown in [](#forcedshut-down). 

Low water can result in:

*	Boiler tube failure
*	Loss of steam pressure
*	Loss of electrical power to auxiliaries
*	Loss of propulsion</Text>

            <Title>Installation</Title>
            <Text>Globe valves are normally installed with the incoming fluid pressure applied to the   bottom of the valve disk, that is, to the side of the disk that closes against the seat.   The top of the disk is the side that does not close against the seat and, in most globe   valves, is the side in contact with the valve stem. When fluid pressure is applied to   the bottom of the disk, the pressure helps the operator open the valve, and the pressure   on the valve packing is relieved when the valve is closed. 
The only time a globe valve is installed with fluid pressure applied to the top of the   disk is when the valve is used as a throttle valve controlling steam flow to an engine.   Installed in this manner, if the disk were to become detached from the stem, the disk   would be carried toward the seat by the steam flow. Even if the disk does not close   tightly against the seat, it would choke off steam flow to the engine and cause it to   slow down. Globe throttle valves installed in this manner are considered fail safe. If   the valve was installed with the steam pressure on the bottom of the disk, and the disk   became detached from the stem, the disk would be carried away from the seat by the steam   flow and cause the engine speed to rise uncontrollably. The steam would also carry the   disk toward the engine where it could enter and cause damage. 
Globe valves cause a relatively large pressure drop in the fluid as it flows through   the valve. Pressure drops are caused by the friction created when the fluid changes   direction of flow through the valve. The straight globe valve, with the pipe connections   180 degrees opposite each other, has the greatest pressure drop through it due to three   to five changes in direction of fluid flow. The right angle valve has a 90 degree angle   between the inlet and outlet pipe connections and fluid flow only changes direction one   or two times, creating less pressure drop than the straight type. Globe valves are also   constructed with 45 or 60 degree angles between the stem and the outlet side of the   valve. This valve design also creates less change in direction of fluid flow, reducing   pressure drop through the valve. 
A globe valve is fully open when the disk is raised ¼ of the diameter, d, of   the seat opening. For full flow to take place through the globe valve, the area the   fluid flows in through and the area the fluid flows out through must be equal. The inlet   area is the hole in the seat, and is equal to the area of a circle or . The fluid flows   out through the space between the top of the seat and the bottom of the disk which is   the side of a cylindrical shape. The area of the side of a cylinder is equal to the   circumference of the circle on the end of the cylinder times the height, h of   the cylinder .

            <Title>Welded Connections</Title>
            <Text>Welding involves melting the base metals (pipes) to fuse them together, typically using an electric arc or gas flame.  Common welding methods for pipes include TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas), MIG (Metal Inert Gas), and stick welding. 
Welding produces a strong and permanent connection suitable for high-pressure and high-temperature applications; however, welded connections are less flexible than soldered or brazed joints, which can be a disadvantage in some situations.

            <Title>Operation of a Governor</Title>
            <Text>The following is an explanation of the operation of a constant speed, hydraulically compensated governor using the Woodward brand governor as an example. The principals involved are common in any mechanical and hydraulic governor. 
The Woodward speed governor operates the diesel engine fuel racks to ensure a constant engine speed is maintained at any load. The governor is a mechanical-hydraulic type governor and receives its supply of oil from the engine lubricating system. This means that a loss of lube oil pressure will cut off the supply of oil to the governor and cause the governor to shut down the engine. This provides the engine with a built-in shutdown device to protect the engine in the event of loss of lubricating oil pressure. 
The governor controls the fuel rack position through a combined action of the hydraulic piston and a set of mechanical flyweights, which are driven by the engine blower shaft. &lt;xref ref="hydraulic-governor"/&gt; provides an illustration of a functional diagram of a mechanical-hydraulic governor. The position of the flyweights is determined by the speed of the engine. As the engine speeds up or down, the weights move in or out. The movement of the flyweights, due to a change in engine speed, moves a small piston (pilot valve) in the governor's hydraulic system. This motion adjusts flow of hydraulic fluid to a large hydraulic piston (servo-motor piston). The large hydraulic piston is linked to the fuel rack and its motion resets the fuel rack for increased/decreased fuel.

Since the absolute atmospheric pressure is always present, and acts on everything equally, we normally don’t even notice it.  Pressure gauges measure pressure up or down from atmospheric pressure, and an ordinary pressure gage reads zero when it is subjected to atmospheric pressure only. Pressure measured in this way is called the gage pressure.  A negative gage pressure is a vacuum.

            <Title>Bends and elbows</Title>
            <Text>Bends and elbows are important parts of any piping system as they allow the integration of flexibility of design by change in the flow direction of the media to be carried inside
The details of these important components are discussed in this chapter
 Bend or Elbow
There is always a doubt about the terms bends and elbows on ships.
They are frequently used as synonyms. between them is as follows:
The difference
 * Bend is a generic term for any offset or change of direction in the piping. It is a vague term that also includes elbows.
* An elbow is an engineering term and is classified as 90 deg or 45 deg, short or long radius.
* Elbows have industrial standards and have limitations to size, bend radius and angle. The angles are usually 45 deg or 90 degrees. All others offsets are classified as pipe bends.
* Bends are generally made or fabricated as per the need of the piping; however elbows are pre fabricated and standard, and are available off the shelf.
* Bends are never sharp corners but elbows are. Pipe bending techniques have constraint as to how much material thinning can be allowed to safely contain the pressure of the fluid to be contained. As elbows are pre fabricated, cast or butt welded, they can be sharp like right angles and return elbows which are 180 degrees.
* Elbow is a standard fitting but bends are custom fabricated.
* In bends as the pipe is bent and there is no welding involved, there is less pipe friction and flow is smoother. In elbows, the welding can create some friction.
* All elbows are bends but all bends are not elbows.
* Bend has a larger radius then elbows. 2
  * Generally the most basic difference is the radius of curvature. Elbows generally have radius of curvature between one to twice the diameter of the
pipe. Bends have a radius of curvature more than twice the diameter.
Short Radius and Long Radius
Elbows are again classified as long radius or short radius elbows. The difference between them of the length and curvature.
Following are some points to differentiate these two:
* Long radius elbows give less frictional resistance to the fluid than the short elbows.
* Long radius elbows create lesser pressure drop than short radius elbows.
* Short radius is less costly than long radius elbows.
* The short radius elbows are used where there is scarcity of space.
 A short radius elbow will be giving the piping a sharper turn than a long radius elbow.
In a long radius elbow the radius of curvature is 1.5 times the nominal diameter. In a standard elbow the radius of curvature is 1.0 times the nominal diameter of the pipe.
In addition to this classification the elbows of 45 degrees, 90 degrees and 180 degrees are called as a return elbow.
  Miter bends
Another type of bend is a Miter bend. A Miter bend is a bend which is made by cutting pipe ends at an angle and joining the pipe ends. A true miter bend is a 90 degree bend made by cutting two pipes at 45 degrees and joining them by
welding. Similarly three pipes cut at 22.5 degrees will give a 90 degree miter bend.
  “Mitered bends are simple to make and can be readily compensated to act acoustically.”</Text>

            <Title>Fuel Metering</Title>
            <Text>The effect of ·plunger rotation on fuel delivery is shown in figure &lt;xref ref="bosch-plunger"/&gt;. In figures A, the plunger is rotated to bring the vertical slot to the edge of the inlet port, which is the setting for maximum delivery. In this plunger position, the lowest part of the helix is in line with the spill port, allowing the longest possible effective stroke before the spill port is uncovered, ending the injection of fuel. Figure B show the setting for medium or normal delivery. This brings a higher part of the helix in line with the spill port and leaves a short effective stroke before the spill port is uncovered. 
&lt;figure xml:id="bosch-plunger"&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Effect of plunger rotation on fuel delivery.&lt;/caption&gt;
  &lt;image source="images/bosch-plunger.png" width="75%"/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
Figure C shows the position of &lt;q&gt;no fuel delivery&lt;/q&gt;, which  is reached when the plunger has been rotated to bring the vertical slot in line with the spill port. In this plunger position, the fuel above the plunger will not be under compression during any part of the upward stroke. 
The amount of fuel injected can be regulated by setting the plunger in any position between no delivery and maximum delivery. The plunger setting is controlled by the position of the control rack, which regulates all the plungers at the same time. Movement of the control rack, either manually or by governor action rotates the plunger and varies the quantity of fuel delivered by the pump. 
Figure &lt;xref ref="bosch-injector-pump"/&gt; illustrates a cutaway view of the Bosch injection pump and control rack assembly. The gear segment is secured to the control sleeve, which is free to rotate on the stationary barrel. The control sleeve has a slot at the bottom into which fits the plunger flange. The flange moves in the slot as the plunger moves up and down. When the control rack is moved lengthwise, the gear segment and the control sleeve rotate around the outside of the barrel. The plunger flange and the plunger (inside the barrel) follow the rotation of the control sleeve.

  &lt;image source="images/bosch-injector-pump" width="50%"/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
The Bosch plunger, shown in figures  &lt;xref first="bosch-plunger" last="unit-injector-pic"/&gt;, has a flat top surface and has only a lower helix. With this type of plunger, fuel injection will always begin at the same point in the piston cycle, whether it is set for light load or heavy load. Injection begins when the ports are closed; the end of injection can be varied by plunger rotation. This type of plunger is used in pumps marked "Timed for port closing." Injection has a constant beginning and variable ending.

            <Title>Units of Measurement</Title>
            <Text>In engineering, temperature is commonly measured in degrees Fahrenheit. In this scale, the boiling point of water at atmospheric pressure is designated 212°, and the freezing point is 32° with 180 equal degrees between. When working in the metric system, the Celsius scale is used. The Celsius scale (sometimes called the centigrade scale) uses zero as the freezing point of water and 100° as its boiling point, with 100 equal divisions or degrees between. 
To convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit: multiply by 1.8 and add 32.  &lt;me&gt;°\mathrm{F} = (1.8 \times °\mathrm{C}) + 32°&lt;/me&gt;The British thermal unit (BTU) is used to measure heat. Originally, 1 BTU was defined as the quantity of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 pound of water through 1° on the Fahrenheit (F) scale. A similar unit called the calorie (cal) was originally defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water through 1° on the Celsius (C) scale. The BTU and calorie are still in use, but the original definitions have been abandoned by international agreement. These units are now defined in terms of the unit of energy called the &lt;q&gt;joule.&lt;/q&gt; By definition, 1 BTU is equal to 1054.886 joules, and 1 cal is equal to 4.18605 joules. As may be seen, the BTU is a much larger unit than the calorie; 1 BTU is equal to approximately 252 cal.

            <Title>Unit Conversions</Title>
            <Text>Frequently, engineers need to find length equivalents between different systems of measurement. For example, in the construction of a ship there may be different contractors, some of whom use US standard measurement and others who use metric. Since the agreed upon system is metric, conversions are required to standardize all measurements.
   &lt;term&gt;Conversion of units&lt;/term&gt; is the process to convert between different units of measurement for the same quantity, typically through multiplicative &lt;term&gt;conversion factors&lt;/term&gt; which change the measured quantity value without changing its effects. Unit conversion is often easier within the metric or the SI than in others, due to the regular 10-base in all units and the prefixes that increase or decrease by 3 powers of 10 at a time.
The &lt;term&gt;unit-factor method&lt;/term&gt; or the &lt;term&gt;unity bracket method&lt;/term&gt; is a widely used technique for unit conversions using the rules of algebra. 
The&lt;term&gt; factor-label method&lt;/term&gt; is the sequential application of conversion factors expressed as fractions and arranged so that any dimensional unit appearing in both the numerator and denominator of any of the fractions can be cancelled out until only the desired set of dimensional units is obtained. For example, 10 miles per hour (mi/hr or mph) can be converted to meters per second (m/s) by using a sequence of conversion factors as shown below:

            <Text>The Converter Cooling cabinet contains the equipment required to remove the heat generated by diodes and IGBTs when the converter is operating. The cubicle contains two circulating pumps (one always in stand-by), a stainless steel plate-type heat exchanger, an expansion tank, a resin deionizing cartridge, stainless steel piping and high pressure hoses.
Deionized water is used as the primary cooling medium. because its low conductivity minimizes corrosion and improves heat transfer, while its purity reduces the accumulation of scale formation.  
De-ionized water is circulated by the pump to the cooling pipes and ducts of the high voltage sections. Returning coolant then passes through a the heat exchange and the heat from the de-ionized water is removed by raw water.  A three-way thermostatic bypass valve controls the flow of raw water to through the heat exchanger to maintain the coolant temperature at an optimum level. 
The coolant pressure, temperature, flow rate and conductivity are closely monitored.  A high temperature coolant alarm will sound at 43°C (110° F).   If a high conductivity is detected, the coolant is shunted through a resin de-ionizing cartridge until until a satisfactory conductivity level is restored,

   - NPT is a widely used thread standard in the United States and Canada.
   - There are two main types: NPT (Tapered) and NPTF (Dryseal).
   - NPT threads are tapered, which helps create a seal by wedging the threads together as the fittings are tightened.
   - NPTF threads have modified shapes to improve sealing without the need for thread sealants.

            <Title>Introduction</Title>
            <Text>The way base units of length have been determined has changed greatly over time. Long ago, the base for reference was the human body. For example, the cubit was a unit that indicated the length from the elbow to the fingertips.
Length units based on the human body were used for thousands of years. The Roman mile (In Latin &lt;foreign&gt;mille passus &lt;/foreign&gt;, which means &lt;q&gt;thousand paces&lt;/q&gt;) consisted of a thousand paces (of 5 feet each) as measured by every other step—as in the total distance of the left foot hitting the ground 1,000 times, which equals approximately 5,000 ft. In 1592, English Parliament wanted to standardize the measurement of the mile and made the decision that it should be equal to eight furlongs. Furlongs, which are still used as a unit of measurement in horse racing, are 660 feet long. 660 times eight equals, you guessed it, 5,280 ft.
This continued until a major change took place around 200 years ago. As the Age of Discovery came to an end and industry grew primarily in Western Europe, it became necessary to unify units of length on a global scale. In the 17th century, discussions were held in Europe regarding the unification of units. After a century of discussions, France proposed the unit of the meter (meaning "to measure" in Greek) in 1791. The reference at this time was the distance of the meridian from the north pole to the equator. One meter was set as 1/10,000,000 of this distance. Today, one meter is defined as "the distance that light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second," as defined in 1983.
For navigation on water (marine), air, and space the nautical mile unit of length is used. Historically, a nautical mile was defined as the meridian arc length corresponding to one minute of a degree of latitude. Nautical mile is based on Earth’s circumference being 360 degrees. These degrees can then be divided into 60 minutes. One of these minutes (or minutes of arc as they are called in navigation) along a great circle on Earth represents one nautical mile. Today the international nautical mile is defined as exactly 1,852 meters (6,076 ft; 1.151 mi).
In terms of statute or land miles, a nautical mile represents 1.15 miles. This is because one degree of latitude is approximately 69 statute miles in length. 1/60th of that measure would be 1.15 statute miles.

            <Text>Since the absolute atmospheric pressure is always present, and acts on everything equally, we normally don’t even notice it. Pressures are usually measured up or down from atmospheric pressure, and an ordinary pressure gage reads zero when it is subjected to atmospheric pressure only. Pressures measured in this way is called the gage pressure. It is important to distinguish between gage pressure and the absolute pressure described in the next section.

            <Text>The exhaust system of a diesel engine performs three functions. First, the exhaust system routes the spent combustion gasses away from the engine, where they are diluted by the atmosphere. This keeps the area around the engine habitable. Second, the exhaust system confines and routes the gasses to the turbocharger, if used. Third, the exhaust system allows mufflers to be used to reduce the engine noise.

Chapter 2 Packing, Transport and Storage
2.1 Packing
The purpose of packing is to protect goods during transport, transshipment and storage and to minimize the cost of such transport, transshipment and storage. In addition to the economic efficiency of packaging, safety - i.e. retention of the value of the packed goods - is of primary importance. All items will be packed in proper type of packing (box, skid, bundle, drum ,bare, etc.) by the supplier under his responsibility. Packing will be designed according to the type and quality of the item. The packing shall be strong enough to ensure maximum safety during shipping.
2.2 Transport
2.2.1 Protective Measures Prior to Transport
The following protective measures are taken before delivery of the machine from the factory. The same protective measures should be taken, whenever the machine is moved:
• All synchronous machines delivered as a unit are provided with transport locking device protecting the machine against damages during transport. The locking device must be attached whenever the machine is transported.
• Machined metal surfaces, such as the shaft extension, are coated with an anti-corrosive coating before delivery.
• The bearings are greased at the factory or during the tests prior to delivery. This gives sufficient protection against corrosion.
• During shipping the machine should be placed under deck.
2.2.2 Lifting the machine
Before the machine is lifted, ensure that suitable lifting equipment is available and that personnel are familiar with lifting work. The weight of the machine is shown on the rating plate, dimension drawing and packing list.
NOTE!
Use only the lifting lugs or eyes intended for lifting the complete machine. Do not use any small additional lifting lugs or eyes available, as they are there only for service purposes. These additional lifting lugs usually have caution name plates adjacent to them.
NOTE!
The center of gravity of machines with the same frame may vary due to different outputs, mounting arrangements and auxiliary equipment.
NOTE!
Check that eyebolts or the lifting lugs integrated with the machine frame are undamaged before lifting. Damaged lifting lugs must not be used.
NOTE!
Lifting eyebolts must be tightened before lifting. If needed, the position of the eyebolt must be adjusted with suitable washers.

Chapter 2 Packing, Transport and Storage
2.2.3 Lifting of unpacked machine
Lifting must be performed with great care and using slings long enough to assure the lifting angle requirements, see Figure 2-1. Lifting of unpacked machines. If the requirements are not met, there is a risk of damage.
• The machine must be lifted from its frame. Do not attempt to lift the machine from the top cover! • lift the complete generating set by the generator lifting points.
• When moving the generator always keep it in the horizontal plane, this will reduce the risk of the rotor falling out if 1-bearing design considered.
2.2.4 Checks upon arrival and unpacking
Check upon arrival
Inspect the machine and the package immediately upon arrival. Any transport damage must be photographed and reported immediately, i.e. within less than one (1) week after arrival, if the transport insurance is to be claimed. It is therefore important, that evidence of careless handling is checked and reported immediately to the transport company and the supplier. A machine that is not installed immediately upon arrival must not be left without supervision or without protective precautions. For more details, see Chapter 2.3.Storage.
Unpacking
Place the synchronous machine so that it does not hinder the handling of any other goods and on a flat, vibration-free surface. When the package has been removed, a check should be made to see that the machine is not damaged and that all accessories are included. Tick off the accessories on the packing list which is enclosed. If there is any damage, suspected damage, or if accessories are missing, please report this immediately to the supplier.

Chapter 2 Packing, Transport and Storage
2.3 Storage
2.3.1 Short term storage (less than 2 months)
The machine should be stored in a proper warehouse with a controllable environment. A good warehouse or storage place has:
• A stable temperature, preferably in the range from 10 oC (50 oF) to 50 oC (120 oF). If the anti- condensation heaters are energized, and the surrounding air is above 50 oC (120 oF), make sure that the machine is not overheated.
• Low relative air humidity, preferably below 75 %. The temperature of the machine should be kept above dew point to prevent moisture from condensing inside the machine. If the machine is equipped with anti-condensation heaters, they should be energized. Verify the operation of the anti-condensation heaters periodically. The anti-condensation heaters shall be de-energized when air temperature inside the machine enclosure exceeds +40 oC. Before connecting power supply to the anti-condensation heater, check the supply voltage and power. If the machine is not equipped with anti-condensation heaters, an alternative method of heating the machine and preventing moisture from condensing in the machine must be used. Machine can be e.g. heated by using power supply in the machine main terminals. Required DC voltage is approx. 5% of the rated voltage and current shall not exceed 30% of the nominal current.
• A stable support free from excessive vibrations and shocks. If vibrations are suspected to be too high, the machine should be isolated by placing suitable rubber blocks under the machine feet.
• Air which is ventilated, clean and free from dust and corrosive gases.
• Protection against harmful insects and vermin.
If the machine needs to be stored outdoors, the machine must never be left ‘as is’ in its transportation package. To store the machine outdoors:
• Take the machine out from its plastic wrap.
• Cover the machine to prevent rain from entering it. The cover should allow ventilation of the machine.
• Place the machine on at least 100 mm (4”) high rigid supports. This prevents moisture from entering the machine from below.
• Provide with good ventilation. If the machine is left in its transportation package, make large enough ventilation holes in the package.
• Use anti-condensation heaters or alternative method of heating for heating the machine and preventing moisture from condensing in the machine
• Protect from harmful insects and vermin.
2.3.2 Long term storage (2-6 months)
In addition to the measures described in Chapter 2.3.1. Short term storage (less than 2 months), some extra measures need taken depending on whether the machine is stored indoors or outdoors.
NOTE!
Be careful not to damage the seals or the bearings.
Storage indoors
To store the machine indoors:
• If the machine is stored in its transportation package, make big enough holes on the sides of the transportation package so that the D-end and ND-end of the machine are accessible.
• If the protection made by the manufacturer has been removed, protect the unpainted surfaces such as shaft extensions, coupling discs, coupling halves and jacking screws with suitable anti-corrosion agent. • If the machine has been delivered in fully assembled condition, turn the rotor approximately 10 revolutions once per every 3 months to maintain a protective oil film or grease on the bearing surfaces.

Chapter 2 Packing, Transport and Storage
Storage outdoors
• To store the machine outdoors:
• Take all the measures described in Storage indoors above.
• Cover the machine completely with a big enough waterproof cover.
• Remove the side and end covers of the machine.
• Protect the bare shaft surfaces and non-painted parts with anti-corrosive agent.
2.3.3 Very long term storage (over 6 months)

3.5 Water cooler 3.5.1 General points
The purpose of the cooler is to remove heat losses of machine.(mechanical, ohmic, etc)
Water cooler is applied if a higher degree of protection is required from IP44 and over. The generators HFJ and HSJ can easily be converted for emergency operation as an open-circuit air-cooled machine if the coolant system or the cooling element fails. The cooler is located on the top of the machine.
The air is circulated by a fan fixed to the synchronous machine shaft.
3.5.2.1 Description of air-water double tube cooler
The double-tube technique keeps the cooling circuit from being affected by possible water leakage. The double tube provides a high safety level.
In case of leakage, the water goes from the inside of the internal tube to the coaxial space between the two tubes. The water is drained axially to a leakage chamber where it may activate a sensor.
An exchanger comprises a fin-tube block containing : • A steel frame
• A fin-tube block expanded mechanically to the tubes.
The tube bundle is roll-expanded in the end plates.
The water distribution in the tubes is provided by two removable water boxes.
A water box is equipped with collars for fitting the inlet and outlet lines. Neoprene seals ensure water tightness between the water boxes and the end plates.
3.5.2.2 Description of air-water single tube cooler
The single-tube technique keeps the vertical direction of cooling circuit from being affected by possible water leakage.
In case of leakage, the water goes from the inside of the tube to the frame. The water is drained to a leakage chamber where it may activate a sensor.

3.5.3 Cleaning
The frequency of cleaning operations depends essentially on the purity of the water used. Annual inspection is recommended at least.
The life of zinc block for anti-corrosion is about a year. Therefore, replace it with a new one every year. Cut off the water supply by isolating the inlet and outlet lines, and drain the water. Disconnect the leakage sensor, and make sure that there are no leaks.
Remove the water boxes on each side of the machine.
Rinse and brush each water box. NOTE !
3.5.4 Stop the machine
Leak detection for water cooler : If a leak is detected, cut off the power supply of the water inlet / outlet lines and change to emergency operations immediately.
The problem must be ascertained and repaired.
Remove the two water boxes, apply a slight positive pressure in the leakage chamber and between the two tubes(only concerns double tube coolers).
If a tube is damaged, plug it at both ends.
Use a tapered plug.
Preferably the plug should be made of salt-water resistant aluminum bronze or a synthetic material. 3.5.5 Leak detection(Float system)
A magnet float activates a switch located in the float case.
3.5.5 Cooler removal
The cooler unit is slid into its housing.
It is possible to remove the cooler from the housing without removing the water boxes as shown as below.
The cooler is fastened to the housing via a series of screws on the housing.
Remove the water supply and return pipes.
Provide two eye-bolts to hold the cooler when it comes out of its housing.
Remove the cooler using slings that can be attached to the connecting flanges.
        Do not use a hard wire brush as this will remove the protective tar-epoxy layer which has formed on the surfaces of the water boxes.
Clean each tube with a metal scraper.
Rinse in soft water.
Keep the leakage chamber dry(double-tube water cooler only)

Chapter 4 Installation and alignment
4.1 Installation of generator
NOTICE
Experience has shown that any base mounted assemblies of generator and driven units temporarily aligned at the factory, no matter how rugged or deep in section may twist during shipment. Therefore, alignment must be checked after mounting.
The lubrication measures for normal bearings to be carried out before or during erection of the machines.
Install the machines so that the cooling air has free access and can escape unobstructed. Warm exhaust air must not be drawn in again.
Louver openings must face downwards to maintain the particular degree protection. Remove the shaft block (where applicable).
Follow the instruction attached to the shaft extension or shown in the terminal box.
The rotors are normally balanced dynamically by mans of a half feather key placed in the shaft extension.
Align the machines carefully and accurately balance the elements to be fitted on the shaft to ensure smooth and vibration-free running.
Place shims under the feet of the machines if necessary to prevent them from being stressed mechanically. Transmissions elements may be fitted and removed only by prevent them from falling out during shipment. A machine must not be commissioned without its transmission element having been fitted.
4.2 Alignment of generator
The correct alignment of machinery is very important for reducing the stress and vibration of the shaft and the wear of the bearing and coupling.
In case a coupling maker gives those instructions, it is recommended that the instructions be followed.
      4.2.1 Flexible Coupling
The flexible coupling set forth herein means the one driven through the rubber brush or the
leather brush including the gear coupling. In aligning the generator equipped with the sleeve bearing, attention is to be paid to the endplay of the generator bearing and to the position of the coupling. The
center of the generator bearing endplay is indicated by the end play indicator.
The bearing endplay can be equally divided by setting the end play indicator to the standard line of the shaft as shown in Fig. 4.1

Chapter 4 Installation and alignment
In case of key type coupling, the axial, parallel and angular tolerance are to be acceptable by coupling element property. In case of flange type coupling, coupling works should be carried out in accordance with standard instructions of the engine maker. (HHI alignment standard as shown on Fig. 4.2)
Fig. 4.2 HHI alignment standard
CAUTION
NOTICE
Experience has shown that any base mounted assemblies of generator and driven units temporarily aligned at the factory, no matter how rugged or deep in section may twist during shipment. Therefore, alignment must be checked after mounting.
4.2.2 Rigid Coupling
In case of the sleeve bearing, when both flanges are connected to each other, the endplay indicator is referred to install the flexible coupling in order to determine the position of the generator.
4.2.3 Alignment
NOTE !
The foot plane is of concern for each unit of rotating equipment. Checked driven equipment if necessary.
Alignment is made to bring the shaft centers of the generator and machine combined with it into the same line; the parallel and eccentricity are measured through the coupling. Generally a thickness gauge or a taper gauge is used in
measuring the parallel, and in
         In case the coupling is used, it may be considered that the rotor can be easily moved in the axial direction. In fact, however, it hardly slides in the axial direction at the coupling as the torque grows greater. When by some reason the rotor has undergone some axial movement, and the coupling does not provide enough slip to allow the rotor to return to the magnetic center of the generator, it will continue to operate with the bearing end in contact with the shoulder of the journal.
             measuring the eccentricity, a dial gauge is to be fitted to the coupling on one side; the
both shafts are to be turned by 0 deg, 90 deg, 180 deg and 270 deg; and the dial gauge
reading is to be taken at the four points as shown in Fig. 4.3 The alignment accuracy is to
be generally 0.025 mm or less (both plate and circle).

Chapter 5 Electrical Connections
5.1 General information
Electrical connections are made after the mechanical installation and alignment procedures.
The electrical connections included the connection of main and auxiliary cables, earthing cables and possible external components.
5.2 Connection of main power cables and neutral cable
The main terminal box is typically supplied drilled plate with cable glands if customer send us specification of main &amp; aux cables. If not, cable gland plates will be supplied as blind. The customer or a third party is therefore responsible for this. The stator terminals are marked with the letters U, V and W according to IEC 60034-8. Stripping, splicing and insulating of the cables must be performed in accordance with the instructions delivered by the cable manufacturer. The lugs should not be permanently tightened by bus bars, but only attached (for checking of insulation resistance). The cables must be supported so that no stress is applied to the bus bars in the terminal box. When three- phase cables are used, the prescribed distance must be maintained between the leads at intersections. Bracing and spacers should be used if necessary.
5.3 Earth connection
The ground cable can be connected inside of the main terminal box. The earth connection of generator frame is located on the foot.
5.4 Insulation distance of main power connections
The connections of the main power cables are designed to withstand demanding operation conditions where the insulators can be subjected to dirt, humidity and surge voltages. In order to ensure lasting and trouble free running, it is therefore important that local requirements or other applicable standards for the insulation distances are met. If no local requirements or other applicable standards are available, it is suggested that the minimum insulation distances mentioned below table. Recommended minimum insulation distances are used. These distances apply both for insulation distances between two different phases, and for insulation distances between one phase and the earth. The air insulation distance is the shortest distance through air between two points with different electrical potential. The surface insulation distance is the shortest distance along surfaces next to each other between two points with different electrical potential.

Chapter 8 Maintenance
8.1 Preventive maintenance
A synchronous machine often forms an important part of a larger installation and if it is supervised and maintained properly, it will be reliable in operation and guarantee a normal life time.
The purpose of maintenance is therefore to :
• Secure that the machine will function reliably without any unforeseen actions or interventions.
• Estimate and plan service actions in order to minimize down time.
This chapter presents recommendations regarding maintenance program, and work instructions how to conduct common maintenance tasks. These instructions and recommendations should be read carefully. Note that the maintenance recommendations presented in this chapter represent a minimum level of maintenance. By intensifying maintenance and supervision activities, the reliability of the machine and the long-term availability will increase.
The data obtained during supervision and maintenance is useful for estimating and planning additional service. In case some of this data indicates something out of the ordinary, trouble shooting will aid in locating the reason for the trouble. HHI recommends the use of experts in the creating maintenance programs, as well as in performing the actual maintenance and possible trouble shooting.
8.2 Safety precautions

            8.4 Maintenance of general construction
To ensure a long life span for the general construction of the machine, the machine exterior should be kept clean and should periodically be inspected for rust, leaks and other defects. Dirt on the machine exterior exposes the frame to corrosion and can affect the cooling of the machines.
8.4.1 Checking during running of machine
During the first days of running it is important to keep the machine under close surveillance in case any changes occur in the vibration or temperature levels or there are abnormal sounds.
During running, pay special attention to temperature and vibration levels.

8.5. Maintenance of bearing 8.5.1 Operating description
NOTICE
Before starting, check if the bearing is filled with oil or not to the necessary oil level.
CAUTION
Prolonged operation at extremely slow rotation speeds (several rpm) without lubrication could seriously damage for the service life of the bearing.
CAUTION
8.5.2 Oil change
8.5.2.1 Ring lubrication system
Check the bearing temperature regularly.
The governing factor is not the temperature rise itself, but the temperature variations over a period of time. If abrupt variations without apparent cause are noticed, shut down the machine and renew the oil.
The lubrication oil indicated on the data plate is used for starting up the machines at an ambient temperature of above +5°C.
At lower temperatures (to about -20°C), it is necessary to preheat the oil.
If the ambient temperature is below -20°C another type of oil according to the special conditions is
used.
Do not mix oils of different grades.
Recommended oil changing intervals are about 3000 and 6000 operating hours in the case of intermittent and continuous duty.
When cleaning, first flush the bearings with kerosene and then with oil.
NOTE !
If the lubrication oil contains unusual residues or its color looks changed, bearings shall be inspected.
Pour in the kerosene and oil through the top sight-glass hole.
Leave the drain open until all the kerosene has been removed and clean oil runs out. Now, plug the drain and fill the bearing with oil up to the center of the lateral inspection glass.
When the machine has run up to speed, check the oil ring through the top inspection glass to see that it rotates correctly, and check the bearing temperature.
Should the bearing temperature not drop to the normal value after the oil change, it is recommended that the surfaces of the bearing shells be inspected.
                    If the bearing temperature exceeds the normal operating value by 15 K, stop the machine immediately. Inspect the bearing and determine the causes. Setting values of a safety device

Chapter 8 Maintenance
If the bearings are fitted with thermometers for checking the bearing temperature, fill the thermometer well in the upper bearing shell for thermo feeler with oil to improve heat transfer and top up with oil every time the lubricating oil is changed.
8.5.2.2 Forced lubrication system
Check the bearing temperature regularly.
The governing factor is not the temperature rise itself, but the temperature variations over a period of time. If abrupt variations without apparent cause are noticed, shut down the machine and renew the oil.
Recommended oil changing intervals are about 20,000 operating hours.
After the machine has come to a stand-still, the old oil is drained out of the bearings and oil tank and operate the oil pump with kerosene for a short time and then with oil to clean the bearings.
For the oil pump, the oil tank, the cooler and the pipe lines: Pour in the kerosene and then the oil through the filling opening of the oil tank. Leave the drains open from time to time until all the kerosene has been removed and clean oil runs out of the bearings and oil tank. Then plug the drains and fill the tank with oil. Should the bearing temperature not drop to the normal value after the oil change, it is recommended that the surfaces of the bearing shells be inspected.

8.6. Maintenance of stator and rotor winding
The windings of rotating electrical machines are subjected to electrical, mechanical and thermal stress. The windings and insulation gradually age and deteriorate due to these stresses. Therefore, the service life of the machine often depends on the insulation durability.
Many processes leading to damages can be prevented or at least slowed down with appropriate maintenance and regular testing. This character offers a general description on how to perform basic cleaning, maintenance and test.
Before conducting any maintenance work on the electrical windings, general electrical safety precautions are to be taken and local regulations are to be respected in order to prevent personnel accidents.
Independent test and maintenance instructions can also be found in the following international standards:
• IEEE Std 43-2000, IEEE Recommended Practice for Testing insulation Resistance of Rotating Machines
8.6.1 Cleaning of stator and rotor winding
Insulated windings should be kept reasonably clean of dirt, oil, metal particles and other contaminants. A film of dirty oil tends to accumulate particles that may interfere with satisfactory ventilation of the machine.
Access the rotor and stator assemblies and then clean windings using one or all of the following methods.

Chapter 8 Maintenance
W ARNING
Use cleaning solution in an open or well-ventilated area; avoid breathing fumes. Keep away from open flames. Do not use a wire brush or a steel blade scraper to clean parts. Do not use gasoline, fuel oil or kerosene for cleaning.
8.6.1.1 Cleaning method
1. Vacuum Cleaning
To remove dust, dirt and particles the use of suction is preferable to blowing out with compressed air, since there is less possibility of damage to insulation and less chance of blowing conducting or harmful particles into areas that may later result in damage during operation.
2. Compressed Air Cleaning
Compressed air to blow out loose dust and particles from inaccessible areas such as air ducts and between stator end turns.
3. Solvent Cleaning
Solvent Cleaning: A method for removing all visible oil, grease, soil, drawing and cutting compounds, and other soluble contaminants from steel surfaces. It is intended that solvent cleaning be used prior to the application of paint and in conjunction with surface preparation methods specified for the removal of rust, mill scale, or paint.
3.1 System Procedure Before Solvent Cleaning
Prior to solvent cleaning, remove foreign matter (other than grease and oil) by one or a combination of the following: brush with stiff fiber or wire brushes, abrade, scrape, or clean with solutions of appropriate cleaners, provided such cleaners are followed by a fresh water rinse.
3.2 Methods of Solvent Cleaning
Remove heavy oil or grease first by scraper. Then remove the remaining oil or grease by either of the following methods:
1) Wipe or scrub the surface with rags or brushes wetted with solvent. Use clean solvent and clean rags or brushes for the final wiping. Acceptable solvents are lacquer thinner and denatured alcohol.
2) Steam clean, using detergents or cleaners and follow by steam or fresh water wash to remove detrimental residues.
3) Solvent cleaned surfaces should be primed or prepared as specified before any detrimental corrosion or recontamination occurs.
4. Steam Cleaning
To provide general guidelines for steam cleaning electrical winding, stator and rotor that have been processed through a complete resin impregnation and cure process.
(Do not steam clean green windings.)
4.1 Scope
1) Cleaning and removal of foreign materials that have accumulated near or on the windings of stators, rotors, exciters, armatures.
2) Cleaning of the outside of these units; provided the defined bake times required to dry the unit after cleaning is adhered to.
4.2 Definitions (optional)
1) Green winding – any winding that does not have a fully cured application of resin or varnish on it.
4.3 Special Tools Required
1) Vacuum Cleaner – preferably with a clean filter so any collected materials can be bagged and saved for evaluation.
2) Preheated oven large enough to accommodate the part.
3) Water containment system to assure water is diverted to a location it can be recovered from and properly disposed of.
4) Calibrated temperature measuring device.

Chapter 8 Maintenance
1. Electrical Windings
• Remove any baffles, shrouds, or other feature that may be removed that could block access to the
areas that require cleaning.
• Vacuum the loose debris from the unit. (DO NOT use an air hose at this operation.)
If practical, use a vacuum with a bag and send the bag with materials collected to QC when task is complete (this is most important for warranty repair work).
• Initiate pre-heat of oven at 50 – 65 0C before starting the steam cleaning process.
The oven must be preheated before placing the just cleaned part into it. Oven must have calibrated
controls and have a temperature recording chart in use.
• Do not begin steam cleaning frame until the steam cleaner spray is clearly a mixture of steam and water. (Do not use soap or detergent.)
• Make sure the waste water is diverted to a location where it can be contained.
• Make sure no unauthorized personnel are in the work area for safety reasons. • To avoid the risk of damage from the steam cleaning process:
1) The nozzle should typically be held 305 to 610 mm from any coil. The practical minimum Distance from nozzle to coils is 105 mm.
2) Avoid a direct spray onto any temperature sensing device or its leads.
3) Only turn the stream of steam on when the wand or nozzle is moving and turn it off before it stops moving.
4) The motion of the wand should create a sweeping type action. 5) Do not apply a continuous stream to any point on the windings.
• Start cleaning at the top surfaces and gradually work down. Repeat the process several times as
needed. Estimated time to clean parts effectively is a minimum of 15minutes plus 3 minutes for every 450 kg of mass. The actual time will vary based on the condition of the unit, but everyeffort should be made to completely clean the unit so a second cleaning can be avoided.
• Place the unit into a preheated 50 – 65 0C oven as soon as possible, but not to exceed 90 minutes from the time the cleaning operation is complete.
• Have inspection visually verify the unit is clean and free of damage.
1) Look for any damage to coils or leads. Highest risk is damage caused by high pressure fluids hitting coil wedges, temperature sensors, space heaters, and coils.
2) Look for evidence of residual debris or dirt that may not have been removed by the steam cleaning process. If a possible problem area exists, sample the area by applying a strip of masking tape to the area, removing and attaching the masking tape to clear plastic film.
Identify the location the sample was collected from and forward samples with this work instruction.
2. Stator and Rotor cores
• Remove any baffles, shrouds, or other feature, that may be removed, that could block access to the areas that require cleaning.
• Vacuum the loose debris from the unit. (DO NOT use an air hose at this operation.)
• Remove any oil, grease or similar materials from the unit with a combination of scrapers, cloths,
solvents, or high pressure fluid stream at room temperature or cooler.
• Preheat the part in an oven at 105 – 120 0C before starting the steam cleaning process. The oven
must be preheated before placing the part into it. Oven must have calibrated controls and have a temperature recording chart in use.
• Do not begin steam cleaning frame until the steam cleaner spray is clearly a mixture of steam and water. (Do not use soap or detergent.) Check temperature of fitting as it enters the flow control handle.
I should be greater than 65 0C.
• Make sure the waste water is diverted to a location where it can be contained.

8.6.2 The correct operating temperature
The correct temperature of the windings is ensured by keeping the exterior surfaces of the machine Clean, by seeing to the correct operation of the cooling system by monitoring the temperature sensors.
For air cooled machines it is important to the cleanliness of air inlets and outlets of air filter.
If the machine is equipped with the temperature detectors, stator operating temperature must be monitored. Significant temperature differences among the detectors or high temperature could be a sign of damage in the windings.
8.6.3 Insulation resistance test
During general maintenance work and before the machine is started up for the first time or after long standstill period, the insulation resistance of stator and rotor windings must be measured.
The insulation resistance measurement provides information about the humidity and dirtiness of the insulation. Based upon this information, correct cleaning and drying actions can be determined.
For new machines with dry winding, the insulation resistance is very high. The resistance can, however, be extremely low if the machine has been subjected to incorrect transportation and storage conditions and humidity, or if the machine is operated incorrectly.
NOTE !
Windings should be earthed briefly immediately after measurement in order to avoid risk of electric shock.
Conversion of measured insulation value
In order to be able to compare measured insulation resistance value, the values are stated at 40°C. The actual measured value is therefore converted to a corresponding 40°C value with the help of the following figure. The use of this figure should be limited to temperature near to the standard value of 40°C, since large deviations from it could result in errors.

• Kt : Insulation resistance temperature coefficient at temperature t°C
Example :
Rt = 30 MΩ measured at 20°C Kt = 0.5
R40 = 0.5 x 30 = 15 MΩ
General consideration
The following consideration should be noted, before deciding any actions based upon the insulation resistance tests :
• If the measured value is considered too low, the winding must be cleaned and /or dried, see Chapter 8.6.7 Drying for details.
• Machines, that are suspected to have a moisture problem, should be dried carefully independent of the measured insulation resistance value.
• The insulation resistance value will decrease when the winding temperature rises.
• The resistance is halved for every 10-15°C temperature rise.
Minimum values for insulation resistance
The limit values for minimum insulation resistance and critical insulation resistance(for measurement at a winding temperature of 25°C) and for measuring voltage can be derived from the following table depending on the rated voltage for the machine.

The insulation resistance is measured using an insulation resistance meter. The test voltage is 500V or 1000 VDC. The test time is 1 minute, after which the insulation resistance value is recorded. Before the insulation resistance test is conducted, check that :
CAUTION
If any CT or PT of generator is earthed, it should be removed before megger test.
• Opening the side cover of cable gland (or main terminal) box on generator top side. • You can see the generator main bus bars.
• Connect the each terminal of Megger Tester between Main Bus Bar (One Phase) and frame
earthling.
• If the measurement value is greater than 100 MOHM, the condition of generator stator winding is
O.K. If not so good, please sufficiently dry the generator windings using the space heater installed into generator body. And then retry the megger test.
• After megger test, please connect the jumper line between main bus bar and frame earthling in order to remove the voltage charged into the generator stator windings.
(Please note that this action is for the safety.)
Insulation resistance measurement of the rotor field winding and excitation machine
The test voltage for the rotor winding and excitation machine is 100V or 500VDC. When testing the windings of the rotors:
• Short circuit the rectifier before measuring
• Measure the rotor winding temperature if possible or estimate otherwise measurement temperature of the rotor winding.
• Opening the air intake side (or inspection cover) of frame body.
• You can see the rotating rectifier's rings on the generator rotor part
• Connect the each terminal of 500V Megger Tester between Rectifier Ring (for Rotating Diode) and Frame Eathing.
• If the measurement value is greater than 10 MOHM, the condition of generator rotor winding
is O.K. If not so good, please sufficiently dry the generator windings using the space heater installed into generator body. And then retry the megger test.
• After megger test, please connect the jumper line between rectifier ring and frame earthing in order to remove the voltage charged into the generator rotor windings.
(Please note that this action is for the satiety.) When testing the stator winding of the excitation machine: • Disconnect the power supply cables from the voltage source.
• Connect the insulation resistance meter between the stator winding and the frame of machine as shown in below figure.

• Measurement of the stator winding of the excitation machine. MΩ represents the insulation
resistance meter.
8.6.4 Polarization index for Medium voltage machine
For the polarization index test the insulation resistance is measured after the voltage has been applied for 15 seconds and 1 minute (or 1 minute and 10 minutes). The polarization index test is less dependent on the temperature is below 50°C, it may be considered independent of temperature. High temperatures can cause unpredictable changes in the polarization index. Therefore the test should not be used in temperature above 50°C.
Dirt and humidity accumulating in the winding normally reduces the insulation resistance, and the polarization index, as well as their dependence on temperature.
There are several rules for determining the lowest acceptable value with which the machine can be safely started. For the polarization index (PI), the values usually range between 1 and 4. Value close to 1 indicate that the windings are humid and dirty.
The minimum PI value for class H stator winding is more than 2, where PI = 𝑅1𝑚𝑖𝑛 or PI = 𝑅10𝑚𝑖𝑛
𝑅1.5𝑠 𝑅1𝑚𝑖𝑛
Note !
If the 1 minute insulation resistance is above 5000 MΩ, it can be disregarded.
8.6.5 High voltage test
A voltage test is used to check for electrically weak spots in the windings that may lead to insulation failure during servicing. It is carried out during major inspections, troubleshooting and repairs.
     8.6.6 Visual winding inspection
Winding inspection give information on:
• The rate of contamination ; presence of dirt and humidity
• Stability of bracings, vibration marks, and cracking Hyundai Electric &amp; Energy Systems, Co., Ltd
Rotating Machines
 40

Chapter 8 Maintenance
• Marks of overheating
• Marks of movement
• Tightness of the slot wedges
• Winding overhangs and their supports
When examining the contamination, particular attention should be paid to the open creep age surfaces, as the insulation resistance is easily affected by the dirt accumulating there.
Accumulating dirt blocks the coil gaps and air ducts, and thus diminishes the cooling capacity of the machine. As a result, the winding temperature rises, and aging may speed up considerably.
Mechanical strain, vibration, and shocks may cause cracks on the edges of the supports, bindings, and around slot ends. Loose supports and slot wedges are signs of further deterioration. Check for abrasion marks and powder near the supports, bindings, and at the slot ends. Complete loosening of the slot wedges and bent coils are serious problem that must be rectified immediately.
Humidity in the winding often causes e.g. rust on iron, drop marks, dripping, and wetting marks on dirt layers. Brush-shaped patterns, often charred and left behind by the tracking currents, warm of an approaching failure. In rare cases, the conductors are corroded.
Marks of the electrical effects (apart from tracking current marks), are usually hidden inside the slot and conductor insulations.
The following are marks of overheating:
Copper in the damper windings grows darker (darkening may also be due to the gases in the environment), and it oxidizes.
• Core laminations of the rotor become blue (over 350°C)
• There are color differences in the fastening bolts of synchronous machines.
• Insulation may shrink or split (usually over 200°C), bindings may crack (over 200°C), and polyester film or fibers may melt (over 250°C).
Prolonged periods over temperatures cause premature aging. The insulating materials become brittle and darken in the early, stages. As a result, the windings split, disintegrate, and fracture.
8.6.7 Drying
The winding must be dried:
• After washing (especially water wash and rinse)
• If they have become humid in use or during a standstill.
Drying should always be started with an external blower or warm air. Other means should be
attempted, only if blower and warm air do not suffice.
During drying, the rate of temperature rise of the winding should not exceed 5 K per hour, and the final temperature should not exceed 105°C. A sudden temperature rise or a too high final temperature can cause steam to be formed in the cavities of the winding, which in turn can destroy the windings. During the drying process, the temperature should be monitored periodically, and the insulation resistance should be measured at regular intervals.
A very wet machine should be dismantled and the winding dried in an oven. Every part should be checked. If the machine is not very wet, the winding can be dried by passing a current through it.
  Hyundai Electric &amp; Energy Systems, Co., Ltd
Rotating Machines
41

Chapter 8 Maintenance
If the winding is dried by passing a current through it, the source of electricity can be e.g. a welding machine or a similar device.
Note !
Direct current or alternate current can be used. The current must not exceed 25% of the nominal current, which is indicated on the rating plate on the machine. The winding temperature should also be continuously monitored.
When drying in an oven, the temperature rise and the maximum temperature should be monitored carefully. The oven temperature should be around 90°C for 12 to 16 hours and then 105°C, for 6 to 8 hours. These times can vary, and the correct time should be monitored with and insulation resistance test.
Drying in an oven with good ventilation is the most effective technique. Unfortunately this is not usually possible at the machine’s operating site. Therefore, either hot-air-blow or heating the windings with current should be used.
An insulation resistance test should be performed after drying the windings. When drying is started, the insulation resistance decreases due to the temperature rise. As the drying continuous, however, the insulation resistance increases until it reaches a stable value.
8.6.8 Maintenance related to electrical performance, excitation, control and Protection
8.6.8.1 Protection trips
The synchronous machine needs to be protected with alarms or alarms/trips in case of abnormal running conditions, both electrical and mechanical. Some of these protections can be reset and the machine restarted directly as the fault is located.
8.6.8.2 Automatic voltage regulator (AVR)
The automatic voltage regulator (AVR) is important in controlling and protecting the machine, and problems in connections or settings of the AVR might lead to different types of operational faults. For detailed information about AVR see Annex 2 - AVR manual.
8.6.8.3 Insulation resistance measurement for auxiliaries
To ensure correct operation of the machines protections and other auxiliaries, their condition can also be determined by an insulation resistance test, however this is not recommended.
8.6.8.4 Diode fault
If a diode in the rotating rectifier fails, the generator must be tripped. To determine and locate a faulty diode:
Open the rectifier covers at the non-drive end of the machine and measure the voltage with an ohm- meter over one of the diodes.
If diode failure is detected, disconnect all diodes and test them separately to locate the faulty diode. To replace faulty diodes:
• Open the rectifier cover at Non-Drive end of the machine.
• Disconnect the wires connected to the diodes and exciter winding connection cables.
• Check the condition of the diodes by measuring the voltage over a diode in both directions • Replace the damaged diode(s).
• Clean the contact surface and apply electric joint compound.

Chapter 8 Maintenance
• Fasten the diode(s). Bind the connection leads of the diodes as on original assembly. • Check fastening and locking of all rectifier bridge components.
• Make sure that no tools etc. are inside the machine and close the service covers.
After replacing the diodes, the condition of the diodes can be checked by comparing no-load excitation current to commissioning values. A diode failure result as a significant increase or decrease in excitation current.

A Megohmmeter or megger is a electrical meter specifically designed to measure very large resistances, particularly the resistance of electric insulation, resistance which is too large to be measured accurately with a DMM. It consists of an internal high voltage source (up to 1000 V), an accurate ammeter, and a display scale marked in megohms.   

&lt;figure xml:id="fig_megger"&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;Megohmmeter&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;image source="images/megger.png"&gt;

&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/sidebyside&gt;
Before use, the equipment under test must be secured, locked out, and grounded to discharge any residual capacitive static charge. The meter is connected between an insulated conductor and ground, and then the test voltage is applied for 60 seconds or until the resistance  reading stops changing, whichever comes first. The meter measures the current flow through the insulation, and using ohm’s law, calculates and displays the insulation resistance. </Text>

            <Text>A cutaway view of a typical marine boiler is shown in &lt;xref ref="sg-0008_png"/&gt;. This boiler is described as a &lt;em&gt;water-tube&lt;/em&gt;, D-Type, accelerated natural circulation boiler, because its tubes contain the water and steam, not combustion gases; are arranged roughly like the letter &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt;; and because the water circulates through the boiler without a pump, purely due to differences in the density of the water and steam. Early marine boilers, and some auxiliary boilers today are designated &lt;em&gt;fire-tube&lt;/em&gt; boilers, because the hot exhaust gases products of combustion pass through the tubes, and the water surrounds the tubes. Other boiler designs and auxiliary boilers will be discussed in more detail in later courses at MMA, either &lt;em&gt;Steam Generators&lt;/em&gt; for marine engineers, or &lt;em&gt;Commercial Boilers&lt;/em&gt; for facilities engineers. 
Steam is generated by burning fuel in the furnace, heating and boiling the water contained inside the tubes and the drums at the top and bottom of the boiler. The gases of combustion flow over the tubes, and since the water temperature within the tubes is lower than the gas temperature, heat flows from the combustion gases into the water. As the heat flows into the water, the water temperature starts to rise, and continues to rise until the water begins to boil. The boiling water forms vapor bubbles like those seen on the bottom of a pan on the stove. The specific volume of these vapor or steam bubbles is about 1600 times greater than the specific volume of the surrounding water. Since density is the inverse of specific volume, the steam bubbles float and rise up to the highest point, the &lt;em&gt;steam drum&lt;/em&gt;. From there, the steam is collected and directed into the superheater tubes, where it picks up additional heat energy, and then is sent on to the main engine as superheated steam to propel the ship or serve other functions. 
The main components of the boiler will be described in this section.

            <Title>Magnitude and Direction</Title>
            <Text>The magnitude of a torque describes how strongly it turns an object, in the same way that the magnitude of a force describes how hard it pushes on something. When you turn a door knob, the magnitude is how hard you twist the knob.  When you push on a door, the magnitude is the product of how hard you push and the distance from the hinges. 
Torque is produced by applying a force at some distance from center of rotation. The magnitude T is found by multiplying the applied  force F by the distance d between the force and the axis of rotation measured perpendicularly. The perpendicular distance d between the force and the axis of rotation is called the moment arm, or the  lever arm.   Note that if the moment arm is largest when the force is at a right angle with the shank of the wrench.
&lt;me&gt;T = F d = F r \sin\theta&lt;/me&gt;
Since the torque is the product of the force’s magnitude and the perpendicular distance, the greater the force, the greater the torque, but the closer force is to the axis of rotation, the smaller the moment. 

&lt;figure xml:id='wrench-T'&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Moment Arm&lt;/caption&gt;

&lt;image source="images/wrench2.png"/&gt;
&lt;/sidebyside&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
The direction of a torque is the direction that the torque tends to rotate the object about its axis.  A clockwise torque is used to tighten ordinary nuts and screws, while a counterclockwise torque loosens them.

            <Title>Soft Starting</Title>
            <Text>Because across-the-line starters provide full voltage to the motor from the start, the motor experiences a high starting current. This initial surge of current is called the inrush current, and it can be several times the motor's full-load operating current.  This problem is more acute for large motors.
Large starting current has two negative effects. First, the high current in the windings can generate enough heat to damage the motor over time, especially if the driven load accelerates slowly. Second, very high starting current can draw down line voltage sufficiently to cause lights to dim and other equipment being supplied from the same line to malfunction. 
To reduce the starting currents of large motors, several methods are employed. &lt;ul&gt;
Wye-delta starters initially connect the motor to the power supply using a wye connection, which provides only 57% of normal voltage.  After a configurable time delay, the connection switches to delta, and full line voltage is available for normal operation. 
Autotransformer starters operate similarly but can supply more intermediate voltage steps. 
Soft starters and variable frequency drives, which are electronic devices, gradually increase the voltage, effectively limiting the starting current.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</Text>

            <Title>Inductors</Title>
            <Text>An inductor is an electrical component that stores energy in a magnetic field when current flows through it. It consists of a coil of wire wound around a core material. When current passes through the coil, a magnetic field is created around it, and this field stores energy. Any device which uses electrical current to produce a magnetic field is an inductor.
An inductor is like a "magnetic energy storage" device. It resists changes in current and helps regulate and control the flow of electricity. They are used in applications like filtering, energy storage, and electromagnets.

&lt;/sidebyside&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

Ferrite core inductors have a core made of ferrite, a ceramic material  containing iron oxide and other elements. The ferrite core concentrates magnetic fields, enhancing the performance of the inductor.
Iron core inductors have a core made of iron or iron-alloy material. They offer higher inductance values and are often used in power supply and filtering applications.
Toroidal inductors have a coil wound around a doughnut-shaped (toroidal) core, providing high inductance and reduced electromagnetic interference.
Variable inductors allow manual adjustment of inductance, and are often used in tuning circuits.
Solenoids are cylindrical coils used to create strong magnetic fields to produce mechanical motion in devices like electromechanical actuators and relays.
Field windings are used to create magnetic field in motors and generators.

            <Title>What is an IGBT?</Title>
            <Text>&lt;sidebyside widths="65% 35%" valign="middle" &gt;
An IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor) is a power semiconductor device that combines the characteristics of a MOSFET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor) and a bipolar junction transistor (BJT). IGBTs are known for their high voltage and current handling capabilities, low conduction losses, and fast switching speeds. IGBTs can rapidly switch on and off in the range of microseconds to a few tens of nanoseconds. They are widely used in high-power electronic applications, such as motor drives, power converters, and inverters.
&lt;image source="images/IGBT_symbol"&gt;
&lt;remix&gt;&lt;source&gt;weh cc0   &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/remix&gt;
&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/sidebyside&gt;
The operation of an IGBT involves three main states:
Off State When no voltage is applied to the gate, the IGBT is in an off state, and only a small leakage current flows from the collector to the emitter. It behaves like an open switch or closed valve.
On State When full voltage is applied to the gate with respect to the emitter, current freely flows from the collector to the emitter. This is the on state of the IGBT, and it can conduct high currents like a closed switch.
Control State The IGBT can be controlled by applying a variable voltage to the gate. When a positive voltage is applied, it turns on the IGBT, allowing current flow. By adjusting the gate voltage, the IGBT can regulate the current flow.

            <Title>Engineroom rounds</Title>
            <Text>Making a thorough inspection round is an important part of being a professional marine engineer. The round will enable you to become familiar with the “normal” operating conditions of the plant, i.e. temperatures, pressures, vibrations, noises, liquid levels and odors. As problems develop, you will recognize small variations and catch them before they develop into larger problems. You will learn which machines are running, which will reduce the time necessary to restart a tripped machine, or to start up a stand-by unit in an emergency. You will note which tanks are in service and their levels, to insure that you have sufficient fuel oil, lube oil and feedwater to complete the watch. 
When you make an engine room round, you should: &lt;ul&gt;
Feel all motors for temperature and vibration. The ends of the motors will give an indication of the condition of the bearings. Heat generated on the motor sides may mean a motor overload or a cooling problem.
Check pump bearings and packing glands for excessive temperature or leakage. Leaking glands should be carefully tightened to minimize leakage into the bilge.
Be observant as you move from space to space.  Note any leaks, unusual vibrations, heat, smells or noises as you move from space to space. 
Check bilge levels for water or oil.  
Maintain good housekeeping. Leaks and spills, burned out light bulbs, loose tools, trash, etc. should be attended to.
Note the operation of gages and other instrumentation. A properly ranged gage will have the needle near the mid position (12 o’clock) during normal operation. A gage which never appears to move may be faulty, and should be replaced.  Note mis-calibrated gages in the maintenance log.
Observe and log all pressures and temperatures to see that they remain normal. Compare your observations with recent readings in the logbook, and look back to identify trends. Subtle changes in pressures or temperatures may indicate developing machinery problems.
Check the oil level in machinery sumps regularly; if changes occur, investigate for leaks. Samples of oil should be tested regularly to check for water leaks and acidity.
Observe and log the main engines and auxiliary machinery oil and cooling water temperatures 
Check the instrumentation on the main switchboard, to note the electrical load and check for grounds.

&lt;!--todo  discuss this with operating engineers --&gt;

            <Title>Water Jacket</Title>
            <Text>Water-cooled engines can overheat if the cooling water system fails to remove waste heat. Removal of the waste heat prevents the engine from seizing due to excessive expansion of the components under a high temperature condition. The cooling water jacket is commonly where the sensor for the cooling water system is located. 
The water jacket temperature sensors provide early warning of abnormal engine temperature, usually an alarm function only. The setpoint is set such that if the condition is corrected in a timely manner, significant engine damage will be avoided. But continued engine operation at the alarm temperature or higher temperatures will lead to engine damage.</Text>

            <Text>Both valves are closed, and the fresh air charge has been compressed. The fuel has been injected and is starting to burn. After the piston passes TDC, heat is rapidly released by the ignition of the fuel, causing a rise in cylinder pressure. Combustion temperatures are around 2336°F. This rise in pressure forces the piston downward and increases the force on the crankshaft for the power stroke as illustrated in Figure 19. The energy generated by the combustion process is not all harnessed. In a two stroke diesel engine, only about 38% of the generated power is harnessed to do work, about 30% is wasted in the form of heat rejected to the cooling system, and about 32% in the form of heat is rejected out the exhaust. In comparison, the four-stroke diesel engine has a thermal distribution of 42% converted to useful work, 28% heat rejected to the cooling system, and 30% heat rejected out the exhaust.

            <Title>Water in the fuel oil</Title>
            <Text>Water in the fuel can lead to low boiler pressure, loss of propulsion, loss of the turbogenerators, etc. The water originates from contaminated fuel delivered onboard, from leaks in fuel oil tank heating coils, or from leaks in the tanks themselves.

The symptoms of water are fires that sputter, burn erratically, or go out.  Water in the fuel also affects the fuel oil service pump, causing erratic fuel pressure, racing and unusual noises.

For safety, the *Kennedy* boilers are fitted with flame detectors which will secure the fuel supply to the individual burners if they detect a flame failure.  Without this device, water in the fuel could cause flarebacks or possibly a boiler explosion. 

Correct operation of the fuel oil settling tanks should minimize the effects of water.  Fuel should be allowed to settle for about a day before use.  The main fuel pump should take suction from the settling tank low suction connection.  If water is detected at the burners, suction can be switched to high, to be above the oil/water interface, and the FO transfer pump can be used to strip the water to the slop tank.</Text>

            <Text>In the event of major flooding, locate and isolate the source as quickly as possible by closing skin valves, and then secure the watertight doors to the AMR and shaft alley to prevent progressive flooding of the adjacent spaces.  

Start all available bilge pumps to control the flooding and de-water the engineroom.  Aboard the *Kennedy* this includes the bilge and ballast pump, the general service pump, the reciprocating bilge pump, the two bilge sump pumps, the oily water separator, the wilden pump, and the two chiller circulating pumps located in the AMR. By Coast Guard regulations, the largest pump in the engineroom, which in our case is the main circulating pump, has an emergency bilge suction which can also be used. For additional capacity, eductor pumps from the damage control lockers can be rigged using firemain pressure.

If the flooding is out of control, secure the boilers and relieve boiler pressure by jacking open the superheater safety valves, to prevent a boiler explosion from occuring when cold water contacts the pressure parts.

To minimize repair costs after a flooding incident, protect flooded machines from rusting by draining and rinsing them inside and out with fresh water and coating all surfaces with a rust preventative or lube oil.  </Text>

            <Title>Head Pressure</Title>
            <Text>Head Pressure 
Head pressure pertains to the pressure exerted by a fluid due to the weight of the fluid a vertical distance above a certain reference point. 
It is commonly measured in meters (m) or feet (ft). Essentially, head pressure represents the potential energy that a fluid possesses, which can be converted into work or kinetic energy. 
A vertical column of water 2.31 feet high exerts one pound of force over one square inch. 
When measuring head pressure, the specific gravity of a fluid must be included. Specific gravity is a measure of the density of a substance in comparison to the density of water. 
The Specific Gravity of fresh water equals 1. 
Pressure/Head Conversion Formula 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;The weight of one cubic foot of fresh water is of 62.427 pounds.&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image7.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;The weight of one cubic foot of fresh water is of 62.427 pounds.&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image6.jpeg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
A column of water one foot high distributed over one square inch = .433 psi 
What this relationship is saying is that for every foot we go up in height, we add 0.433 pounds per square inch at the base of an object. Or we multiply the height of the water by 0.433. Keep in mind that we are talking about water here and specifically the density and weight of water. Other liquids will have their own density, and therefore the psi at the bottom of a column of another liquid would be different than that of water. 
Example problems: 
A column of water 10 ft high exerts what pressure? 
Answer___________________ 
A Column of water 100 ft high exerts what pressure? 
Answer___________________ 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Column of water one foot high&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image8.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
For columns of water less than one foot, we multiply the height in inches by .036 psi. 
There are 12 inches in 1 foot, therefore \frac{.433psiperfoot}{12inchesperfoot} = .036 psi 
One Inch of Water = .036 psi. 
A column of water 12 inches high exerts what pressure? 
Answer____________________ 
A column of water 6 inches high exerts what pressure? 
Answer___________________ 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;One Cubic Inch of Fresh Water&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image9.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
A column of water 2.31 feet in height gives us a pressure at the base of 1 psi. 

   \frac{1poundofwaterequalswhatverticaldistance?}{1footofwaterexerts.433psi} = \frac{1psiwater}{.433\frac{psi}{foot}/water} =\frac{1psi}{.433psi} = 2.31 feet of water exerts one pound force

            <Title>Plug Valves</Title>
            <Text>Plug valves, &lt;xref ref="plugvalve_png"/&gt;, have a through-ported cylindrical or tapered   plug which can rotate in a close-fitting body. Alignment of the ports (holes) in the   plug with those in the body permit fluid flow. 
Operation of a plug valve requires rotating the handle or lever on the plug stem 90   degrees. Normally the plug valves (for the most common type with two pipe connections   180 degrees apart) position (open or closed) can be determined by looking at the   operating lever. When the lever is parallel to the piping system, the valve is open.   When the lever is perpendicular to the piping system, the valve is closed. 
Plugs valves have limited throttling ability and should be used like gate valves,   either fully open or closed. 
Plug valves may be built with multiple openings in the plug and multiple ports in the   valve body. These designs allow a variety of fluid flow directions through the plug   valve by proper positioning of the operating lever. Pointers attached to the plug stem   or operating lever are sometimes used to indicate direction of flow. 
When a plug valve is described as &lt;q&gt;three-way, two-port&lt;/q&gt; it means the valve body   has three openings to pipe connections on the outside of the body. Two port means the   plug has two openings in it that fluid flows in and out through.

            <Title>Horsepower</Title>
            <Text>Power is the amount of work done per unit time or the rate of doing work. For a diesel engine, power is rated in units of horsepower. Indicated horsepower is the power transmitted to the pistons by the gas in the cylinders and is mathematically calculated. 
Brake horsepower refers to the amount of usable power delivered by the engine to the end crankshaft. Indicated horsepower can be as much as 15% higher than brake horsepower. The difference is due to internal engine friction, combustion inefficiencies, and parasitic losses, for example, oil pump, blower, water pump, etc. 
The ratio of an engine's brake horsepower and its indicated horsepower is called the mechanical efficiency of the engine. The mechanical efficiency of a four-cycle diesel is about 82 to 90 percent. This is slightly lower than the efficiency of the two-cycle diesel engine. The lower mechanical efficiency is due to the additional friction losses and power needed to drive the piston through the extra 2 strokes. 
Engines are rated not only in horsepower but also by the torque they produce. Torque is a measure of the engine's ability to apply the power it is generating. Torque is commonly given in units of lb-ft.</Text>

            <Title>Speed Measurement</Title>
            <Text>Various instruments are used to measure speed, depending on the context and type of speed being measured. Here are some common instruments: 
Speedometer: Commonly found in vehicles, it measures the speed of the vehicle in units such as kilometers per hour (km/h) or miles per hour (mph). Instruments, such as the speedometer, can display the instantaneous speed of a vehicle. 
Radar Gun: Often used by law enforcement to measure the speed of moving vehicles. It works by emitting radio waves and measuring the Doppler shift of the reflected waves. 
Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging): Uses laser pulses to measure the distance to an object and can determine its speed by analyzing the time it takes for the laser to return. 
Pedometer: Measures the number of steps taken and can estimate speed based on stride length and the number of steps per minute. 
GPS (Global Positioning System): Uses satellite signals to determine the position of an object over time, calculating speed based on changes in position. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Speedometer showing an instantaneous speed of 172.1 Km/h.&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image35.jpeg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
For Measuring Rotational Speed: 
Tachometer: Measures the rotational speed of a shaft or disk, typically in revolutions per minute (RPM). 
Stroboscope: Uses flashing light to measure rotational speed by making a rotating object appear stationary when the light flashes at the same frequency as the rotation. 
Optical Encoders: Detect rotational position and speed by using light and photodetectors to measure the movement of a patterned disk.

            <Title>Introduction</Title>
            <Text>Electricity is associated with the accumulation or the flow of charged particles, particularly electrons, which are negatively-charged, subatomic particles. Charged particles will naturally flow from areas of high concentration to low concentration if a conductive path is available. The conductor is usually solid, like a copper wire, but can also be liquids such as salt water and mercury, or ionized gases. 
Static electricity is caused by the accumulation of electrons, as might occur from rubbing hard rubber on a wool carpet. The resulting static charge  can be released suddenly as a spark when you touch a metal object. During a thunderstorm, large quantities of charged particles build up in the clouds and are eventually released to the earth as lightning through ionized air. 
In practical devices, the charged particles are made to flow in a controlled fashion through an electrical circuit to supply power to electrical loads, such as lights, motors, heating elements, electronic devices, etc.  This flow of charged particles is called electrical current.
In this section we introduce some important concepts and vocabulary related to electricity, electric circuits, and electrical machines. </Text>

This module also protects the inverter and DC bus from damage caused by the propulsion motors when the ship is slowing down.  During these periods the momentum of the ship will drive the propellor and motor, causing the motors to behave like generators and produce electrical power.  
Excessive electrical power cannot be fed back into the electrical distribution system, so when the DC bus reaches a certain voltage, the excess energy is shunted through a chopper unit to braking resistors.  The braking resistors are located near the converter rooms, and are capable of dissipating up to 10 MJ for 20 seconds once every 30 minutes</Text>

I = 0.6 A, E_1 = 6 V, E_2 = 12 V, E_3 = 30 V.
&lt;/answer&gt;
&lt;solution&gt;
The total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances &lt;me&gt;R_t = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 = 80\ \Omega&lt;/me&gt;.
By Ohms Law, the current is &lt;me&gt;I = E/R_t = \frac{48 \text{ V}}{80 \Omega} = 0.6 \text{ A}&lt;/me&gt;.
The voltage drop across each resistor is &lt;md&gt;

            <Title>What is Pulse Width Modulation?</Title>
            <Text>Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is a technique used in electronics to control the average value of a signal.  PWM works by rapidly turning a signal (usually a square wave) on and off. The overall effect is that the signal appears to have varying average voltage or power, depending on the width of the on or high portion of the signal.
The duty cycle is a parameter of PWM that represents the percentage of time the signal is on or at a high level compared to the period &lt;mdash/&gt; the time to complete one cycle. It determines the average value of the signal. A duty cycle of 50% means the signal is on for half the time and off for the other half, resulting in an average voltage or power that is halfway between the high and low levels. By changing the duty cycle, the average value of the signal can be controlled. Increasing the duty cycle increases the average value, while decreasing the duty cycle decreases the average value.

&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/sidebyside&gt;
PWM requires a control signal that determines the desired average value. This control signal could come from a microcontroller, analog circuit, or other control systems.
The PWM signal is often passed through a low-pass filter. The filter averages out the rapid switching of the signal, resulting in a smoother output signal with the desired average value.

            <Title>Introduction</Title>
            <Text>Time is a fundamental and abstract concept that is used to order events, quantify the duration between events, and describe the progression of phenomena. It is one of the basic dimensions in the physical universe, along with length and mass. 
Measuring time began more than thirty thousand years ago. But back then, societies did not have clocks. Time was measured by the patterns of the moon, shadows of the sun, and the placement of the stars in the sky. These astronomical objects were widely used to determine time. 
Humankind’s need to gauge the divisions of the day and night led the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans to create sundials, water clocks, and other early chronometric tools. Western Europeans adopted these technologies, but by the 13th century, demand for a dependable timekeeping instrument led medieval artisans to invent the mechanical clock. Although this new device satisfied the requirements of monastic and urban communities, it was too inaccurate and unreliable for scientific application or navigation. 
Precision chronometers accurate enough to determine a ship's longitude were not developed until the mid 1700's.  These precision chronometers went on to play key roles in the Industrial Revolution and the advance of Western civilization.

&lt;/figure&gt;
Today, inexpensive, highly accurate time is available everywhere. Signals from atomic clocks, the internet's network time protocol (NTP), and from GPS satellites provide everyone with the correct time with accuracy unheard of just a few years ago.

            <Text>A  pump is a device used to increase the pressure and move &lt;em&gt;liquids&lt;/em&gt;, such as water or oil, or &lt;em&gt;slurries,&lt;/em&gt; which are mixtures of liquids and solids, through pipes. If a pump is used to move gases, it is usually referred to as a  fan,  compressor, or  blower. 
The fluid inlet to the pump is called the suction. Fluid flows from the suction into the pump  chamber, and then out the pump  discharge. While the fluid is in the pump chamber, an external power source imparts energy to the fluid in order to: &lt;ul&gt;
 move the fluid from a lower to a higher level 
 move the fluid from a lower to a higher pressure 
 overcome fluid friction in the passages and pipelines 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Most of the energy from the external power source is transformed into usable fluid &lt;em&gt;pressure&lt;/em&gt;, which is a form of potential energy, or into &lt;em&gt;velocity&lt;/em&gt;, which increases the kinetic energy of the fluid. The remainder of the energy is absorbed by frictional losses in the pump and fluid passages, and shows up as heat. The fluid, now at a higher energy level, is led to the pump outlet called the discharge. 
The external energy supplied to most pump shafts is in the form of torque, produced by electric motors, diesel or gas engines, or gas or steam turbines. Some pumps use a sliding, back-and-forth, external motion and are known as  reciprocating. Pressurized gas or liquid is used as an energy source to operate a  jet type pump. 
The  capacity of a pump is the volume of fluid that the pump can move (under specific operating conditions) per unit of time and is usually expressed as &lt;q&gt;Gallons per Minute&lt;/q&gt; or &lt;q&gt;GPM&lt;/q&gt; for short. The pressure that a pump is capable of delivering is described as the pump  head, and will be discussed in the next section.

            <Text>Air, which is all around you, has weight, and it presses against everything it touches. This pressure is called atmospheric pressure, or air pressure. Atmospheric pressure is the force exerted on a surface by the air above it as gravity pulls it to Earth. Atmospheric pressure is the pressure exerted by the Earth's atmosphere at a given location. Elevation affects atmospheric pressure. For example, standard atmospheric pressure at sea level is approximately 14.7 psia or 101.325 kPa. In Denver, Colorado, atmospheric pressure is 12.4 psia or about 84.0 kPa, and in Death Valley, California it is 14.9 psia or 102.6 kPa. Atmospheric pressure is commonly measured with a barometer.

            <Text>&lt;statement&gt;
For the series-parallel circuit below, determine the total current I if the battery supplies 120 V, and the resistors are R_1 = 100\ \Omega, R_2 = 200\ \Omega, and R_3= 500\ \Omega.
&lt;image width="60%" source="images/series_parallel"/&gt; 

&lt;/statement&gt;
&lt;answer&gt;
I = 0.494 A = 494 mA. 
&lt;/answer&gt;
&lt;solution&gt;
The system can be thought of as resistor R_1 in series with the parallel combination of resistors R_2 and R_3.   The total resistance of this combination is&lt;md&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt;R_t   \amp= R_1 + \frac{1}{\frac{1}{R_2}+\frac{1}{R_3}} &lt;/mrow&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt;    \amp=  100  + \frac{1}{\frac{1}{200}+\frac{1}{500}}&lt;/mrow&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt;    \amp= 242.9\ \Omega&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/md&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Applying Ohm’s Law with this resistance gives the current&lt;me&gt; I =  E/R_t =  \frac{120 \text{ V}}{242.9\ \Omega} = 0.494\text{ A} &lt;/me&gt;

            <Title>Unions and Couplings</Title>
            <Text>Couplings and unions are both pipe fittings used to join two pipes or nipples together, but they are used in different situations. Couplings are used to make a permanent connections, while unions are used to permit the system to be taken apart for maintenance from time to time.
&lt;figure xml:id="fig_coupling_union" &gt;

&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
A coupling is a simple, short section of pipe with internal female threads.  Two sections of pipe are tightened into the coupling to make the connection.  In order to disassemble the connection, one of the pipes needs to be rotated through several rotations to unscrew it.  This is not too practical because the entire system may need to be taken apart to remove one piece.  
A union consists of three parts – male and female parts with matching tapered faces, and a hexagonal union nut with internal threads which fits over the male part and screws onto straight threads on the female part.  
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Union Cross-section and Disassembled&lt;/caption&gt;

&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/sidebyside&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
The union is assembled by sliding the union nut over the male part,  then screwing the male and female parts permanently onto the pipes. After the pipes are aligned, the union nut is tightened to draw the two tapered faces together to create a seal.  Pipe dope or teflon tape must be used on the tapered threads, but should not be used on the mating faces.  Pipes connected with a union can be taken apart by unscrewing the union nut without affecting other parts of the piping system.

            <Title>Ohm’s Law</Title>
            <Text>Ohm’s law describes the relationship between current, voltage, and resistance in an electric circuit. According to Ohm's Law, the current flowing through a circuit is directly proportional to the voltage across it and inversely proportional to the resistance of the circuit. Mathematically, this relationship is expressed as &lt;men xml:id="ohms-law"&gt;I = V/R&lt;/men&gt;  where: &lt;ul marker=""&gt;
I is the the current in amperes
V is the voltage in volts, and 
R is the resistance in ohms. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
In other words, an increase in voltage leads to a corresponding increase in current if the resistance remains constant, while an increase in resistance results in a decrease in current for a given voltage.
It's important to note that Ohm's Law is most applicable to linear resistors under constant conditions. In AC circuits with reactive components like capacitors and inductors, Ohm's Law needs to be extended to include the concept of impedance, which takes into account both resistance and reactance.
Use this digram for the three example problems below.

1. Fundamental Concepts
1.1 Electric Motors
The electric motor is a machine capable of converting electrical energy into mechanical energy. The induction motor is the most widely used type of motor because it combines
all the advantages offered by the electrical energy such as
low cost, easy of supply and distribution, clean handling and simple controls - together with those of simple construction and its great versatility to be adapted to wide ranges of loads and improved efficiencies. The most common types of electric motors are:
a ) Direct current motors
These motors are quite expensive requiring a direct current source or a converting device to convert normal alternating current into direct current. They are capable of operating with adjustable speeds over a wide range and are perfectly suited for accurate and flexible speed control. Therefore, their use is restricted to special applications where these requirements compensate the much higher installation and maintenance costs.
Technological Universe of Electric Motors
b ) Alternating current motors
These are the most frequently used motors because electrical power is normally supplied as alternating current. The most common types are:
Synchronous motors: synchronous motors are three-phase AC motors which run at fixed speed, without slip, and are generally applied for large outputs (due to their relatively high costs in smaller frame sizes).
Induction motor: these motors generally run at a constant speed which changes slightly when mechanical loads are applied to the motor shaft. Due to its simplicity, robustness and low cost, this type of motor is the most widely used and, in practical terms, is quite suitable for almost all types of machines. Currently it is possible to control the speed of induction motors by frequency inverters.
   Figure 1.1 - Technological Universe of Electric Motors
6 Specification of Electric Motors
This Classification Diagram shows the most widely used types of motors. Motors for specific use and with reduced application are not shown.

1.2 Basic Concepts
For a better understanding of the next sections, the following are described the concepts of some principles of Physics concerning energy and forces.
1.2.1 Torque
Torque, also known as moment of force, is the measure
of the energy required to rotate a shaft. Through practical experience, we can note that for lifting a weight similar to the one used in water wells (see figure 1.2). The required force “F” to be applied on the winch depends on the length “E” of the crank handle. The larger the crank handle, the less force is required. By doubling the length “E” of the crank handle, the required force “F” is reduced by half.
Figure 1.2 shows that the bucket weights 20 N while the diameter of the drum is 0.20 m, thus permitting the rope to transmit a force of 20 N on the drum’s surface, i.e. at 0.10 m from the axis center. In order to counterbalance this force, 10 N is must be applied on the crank handle if “E” has a length of 0.20 m. If “E” is twice as much, i.e. 0.40 m, force “F” becomes half, or 5 N. As you can see, to measure the “energy” required to make the shaft rotate, it is not sufficient to define the force applied but it is also necessary to indicate at what distance from the shaft center the force is applied. You must also inform at what distance from the shaft center the force is applied. The “energy” is measured by the torque. that is the result of “F” (force) x “E” (distance). F x E. In the given example, the torque is:
C = 20 N x 0.10 m = 10 N x 0.20 m = 5 N x 0.40 m = 2.0 Nm
Therefore, by using an electric motor to lift a water bucket in 2.0 seconds, the required Power will be:
C = F . E
(N.m)

P1 = = 245 W

If we use a higher power rating motor, able to do this work in 1.3 seconds, the required power will be:
490
P2 = = 377 W
1.3
The most commonly used unit for measuring the mechanical power is HP (horsepower), equivalent to 0.7457 kW (measuring unit used internationally for the same purpose).
Relationship between power units P (kW) = 0.7457 . P (HP)
P (HP) = 1.341 P (kW)
In this case the outputs of the above mentioned motors will be:

1.2.2 Mechanical Energy &amp; Power
Power measures the "speed" with which energy is applied or consumed. In the previous example, if the well is 24.5 m deep the work or energy (W) spent to lift the bucket from the bottom of the well up to the wellhead will always be the same: 20 N x 24.6 m = 490 Nm
Note: the measuring unit for the mechanical energy, Nm, is the same that is used for torque - however the values are of different nature and therefore should not be confused.
W = F . d (N.m)
OBS.: 1 Nm = 1 J = Power x time = Watts x second
Power expresses how quick the energy is applied, it is calculated by dividing the total energy or work by the time in which it is done.
Although energy is always one and the same thing, it can be presented in several forms. By connecting a resistance to a voltage supply, an electric current will flow through the resistance that will be heated. The resistance absorbs energy, transforming it into heat which is also a form of energy. An electric motor absorbs electric energy from the power supply, transforming it into mechanical energy available at the end of the shaft.

DC Circuits
The “electric power” on DC circuits can be obtained by the ratio among voltage (U), current (I) and resistance (R) involved in such circuit, that is:
P = U . I (W)
or
U2
P= (W) R
or
P = R . I2 (W)
Where: U = voltage ( V )
I = current ( Amps )
R = resistance ( Ω )
P = average Power ( W )
AC Circuits
a ) Resistance
In the case of “resistances”, the higher the supply voltage, the higher the current that results in faster heating of the resistance. This means that the electric power will be higher. The electric energy absorbed from the line, in case of resistance, is calculated by multiplying the line voltage by the current if the resistance ( load ) is single-phase.
P = Uf . If (W)
In a three-phase system, the power in each phase of the load is Pf = Uf x If as it were an independent single-phase system. The total power is the sum of the power of the three-phases, i.e.:
P = 3Pf = 3 . Uf . If
Considering that the three-phase system can be delta or star connected, we will have the following relations:
Star-connection: U = √ 3 . Uf e I = If Delta-connection: U = Uf e I =√ 3 . If Thus, the total power for both connections will:
P = √ 3 . U . I (W)
Note: this formula applies to resistive loads only, i.e. where there is no phase shift of the current.
b ) Reactive loads
For “reactive” loads, i.e. where there is phase shifting in the case of induction motors, the phase shift must be taken into account and the formula then becomes.
P = √ 3 . U . I . cos φ (W)
Where: U = Line voltage I = Line current
cos φ = Phase shift angle between voltage and current.
Electric power is normally measured in watts ( W ) corresponding to 1 volt x 1 ampere or its multiple kilowatts ( kW ) = 1000 watts. This unit may also be used to measure the output of mechanical power. Electric energy is normally measured by the kilowatt-hour ( kWh ) corresponding to the energy supplied by a power of 1 kW over a period of 1 hour ( this is the unit appearing on electricity bills ).
1.2.4 Apparent, Active and Reactive Power
Apparent power ( S )
It is the multiplication result of the voltage by the current
( S = U . I for single-phase systems and S =√3 . U . I, for three-phase systems. This corresponds to the effective power which exists when there is no phase displacement of the current, i. e. for the resistive loads. Then,
S =
P Cos φ
( VA )
 Evidently, for resistive loads, cos φ = 1, and the effective power can then be interpreted as apparent power. The measuring unit for apparent power is volt-ampere ( VA ) or its multiple, kilovolt-ampere ( kVA ).
Active power ( P )
It is the portion of apparent power that performs work, that is, the portion that is converted into energy.
P = √ 3 . U . I . cos φ ( W ) or P = S . cos φ ( W )
Reactive power ( Q )
It is the portion of apparent power that does “not” perform work. It is only transferred and stored on passive elements ( capacitors and inductors ) of the circuit.
Q = √ 3 . U. I sen φ ( VAr ) or Q = S . sen φ ( VAr ) Power triangle
Figure 1.3 - Power Triangle ( inductive load )
   8 Specification of Electric Motors

1.2.5 Power Factor
The power factor is indicated by cos φ, where φ is the angle of voltage displacement relating to the current. It is the relationship between active ( P ) and the apparent power
( S ) (Figure 1.3).
Power factor correction
The increase of power factor is made by the connection of a capacitive load, in general, a capacitor or a synchronous motor with overexcitation, in parallel with the load.
For example:
A three-phase electric motor, 100 HP ( 75 kW ), IV poles, running at 100% of the rated power, with an original power factor of 0.87 and efficiency of 93.5%. Now a reactive power should be determined to raise the power factor to 0.95.
Solution:
Using the table 1.2, on the intersection of 0.87 line with the column of 0.95, we get the value 0.238 that multiplied by the motor absorbed power from the line in kW, gives the amount of reactive power necessary to increase the power factor from 0.87 to 0.95.

  Then we can state that,
g Resistive load: cos φ = 1
g Inductive load: cos φ ( delayed )
g Capacitive load: cos φ ( advanced )
Note: the terms “delayed” and “advanced” refers to the current angle relating to the voltage angle.
A motor does not draw only active power, transformed after in mechanical power and heat (losses), but also absorbs reactive power needed for magnetization, but that does not produce work. On the diagram of figure 1.4, the vector P represents the active power and Q the reactive power, which added results in the apparent power S. The power factor is determined by measuring the input power, voltage and, rated load current.
Figure 1.4 - The Power factor is determined measuring the input power, the voltage and the rated load
Power factor importance
Reactive energy limits useful (active) energy carrying capacity in the transmission, sub-transmission, and distribution, in other words, the higher the power factor, the greater the availability of active power in the system and greater is the use of the electrical system.
The electric motor plays a very important role in the industry since it represents more than 68% of the energy consumption. Therefore, it is essential to apply motors with outputs and features well adapted to its function since the power factor changes with motor load.

10 Specification of Electric Motors

1.2.6 Efficiency
The electric motor efficiency is defined as how efficient it is to make the conversion of the line absorbed electric energy into mechanical energy available at the shaft end. The efficiency defines how this transformation is made. By calling mechanical power available at the shaft end “output” (Pu ) and electric energy absorbed by the motor from the supply “input” (Pa ), the efficiency is the ratio between these two, i.e.,
By representing the values U and I in a graph at successive instants, we obtain figure 1.5b. Figure 1.5b also shows some values which will be defined further on. It can be noted that the voltage and current waves are not “in phase”, i.e. they do not pass the zero point simultaneously, notwithstanding the fact that they are of the same frequency. This occurs with many types of electrical loads e.g. electric motors (reactive loads).
Frequency
Is the number of times per second the voltage changes its direction and returns to the initial condition. It is expressed in “cycle per second ” or “Hertz” and is represented by Hz.
Maximum voltage ( Umax )
This is the “peak value” of the voltage, i.e. the instantaneous crest value achieved by the voltage during one cycle (one half of the cycle is positive and the other half negative, this is reached twice per cycle).
Maximum current ( Imax )
This is the “peak“ of the current.
Effective value of voltage and current ( U and I )
It is the value of the continuous voltage and current which generate an output corresponding to that generated by the alternated current. We can identify the effective value as:
Pu ( W )
η = = Pa ( W )
745 . P ( HP ) √ 3 . U . I. cos φ
=

 1.2.7 Torque Versus Power Ratio
When mechanical energy is applied in the form of a rotating movement, the developed output depends on the torque C
and on the rotational speed n.
C ( kgfm ) . n ( rpm P ( HP ) =

For example:
If we connect a “resistance” to an AC circuit ( cos φ = 1 ) with Umax = 311 V and
Imax = 14. 14 A.
the developed output power will be:
P = U . I . COS φ = Umax . Imax . 311 . 14.14 . 1 √2√2
P = 2.200 Watts = 2.2 kW
Note: usually, when referring to voltage and current, for example, 220 V or 10 A, without mentioning any other factor, we are referring to voltage or current effective values, which are normally applied.
Phase displacement ( φ )
Phase displacement means “delay” of the current wave with respect to the voltage wave (see figure 1.5b). Instead of being measured in time (seconds), this delay is usually measured
in degrees, corresponding to the fraction of a complete cycle, taking 1 cycle = 360o. However, phase displacement
is usually expressed by the angle cosine ( see Item 1.2.5 - Power Factor ).
1.3.1 Connection: Parallel and Series
Figure 1.6a Figure 1.6b
  1.3 Single-Phase AC Systems
Alternating current is distinguished by that voltage, which (instead of being a steady one, as for instance between the poles of a battery) varies with time, alternately reversing its direction.
In the single-phase systems, the alternating voltage U (Volts) is generated and applied between two wires to which the load absorbing current I (Amperes) is connected - see figure 1.5a.
  Figure 1.5a Figure 1.5b
Specification of Electric Motors 11

www.weg.net
 Two equal loads can be connected, for example, to a single- phase system, in two different ways:
g By making a series connection ( figure 1.6a ), where the
total current flows through the two loads. In this case, the
voltage across each load is half of the circuit voltage. g By making a parallel connection ( figure 1.6b ), where the
voltage is applied across each load. In this case, the current in each load is half of the total circuit current.
1.4 Three-Phase AC System
A three-phase system is formed by associating three single- phase voltage system, U1, U2 and U3 which so the phase displacement between any two of them ch is 120o, which means, the “delays” of U2 relating to U1, U3 relating to U2, relating to U3, are equal to 120o ( considering a complete cycle = 360o ). The system is balanced if the three voltages have the same effective value, U1 = U2 = U3, as shown
in figure 1.7.
Figure 1.7
By interconnecting the three single-phase systems and by eliminating the unnecessary wires, we have a three-phase system: three balanced voltages U1, U2 and U3 the phases of which are reciprocally displaced by 120o and applied between the three wires of the system. There are two different ways of making a connection, as shown in the following diagrams.
In these diagrams the voltage is usually shown by inclined arrows or rotating vectors and maintaining between them

By connecting the three single-phase systems, as shown in figures 1.8a, b and c, we can eliminate the three wires, leaving only one at each connecting point. Thus, the three- phase system can be reduced to three-wires, L1, L2, and L3.

1.4.2 Star Connection
By connecting one of the wires of each single-phase system to a common point, the three remaining wires will form a three-phase star system (see figure 1.9a). Sometimes the three-phase star system is made as a “four wire” or with the “neutral wire” system. The fourth wire is connected to the common point for the three phases.

The line voltage, or rated voltage of the three-phase system - and the line current - are defined in the same way as for delta-connections.

This manual covers “squirrel cage rotor motor” where
the rotor consists of a set of non-insulated bars that are interconnected by short-circuiting rings. What characterizes an induction motor is a fact that only the stator is connected to the power supply. The rotor is not power supplied externally and the currents that flow through it are induced electromagnetically by the stator from which comes the induction motor name.
1.5.1 Working Principle - Rotating Field
When an electric current flows through a coil, a magnetic field is generated, the direction of which is along the coil axis and proportional in value to the current.

corrosion and with cooling fins.

a ) Figure 1.11a shows a single-phase winding through
which flow the current I, and the field H, generated by the current. The winding is composed of one pair of poles,
the North Pole and the South Pole, the effects of which are added to produce field H. The magnetic flux passes through the rotor, across both poles and links up with itself by means of the stator core. When "I" is an alternating current, field H is established in the same way, so that its value is represented at every instant, by the same chart shown in figure 1.5b, also reversing its direction at every half cycle. The field H is pulsating, its intensity “varies” proportionally to the current, always in the same direction - North-South.
b ) Figure 1.11b shows a three-phase winding consisting of three single-phase winding displaced 120o each other. If this winding is fed from a three-phase system, currents I1, I2 and I3 will generate their own magnetic fields H1, H2 and H3 in a similar way. The displacement between these fields is 120o; moreover, since they are proportional to the respective currents, the phase displacement in time between them will equally be 120o, which can be represented in a chart similar to figure 1.7. At any instant, the total resulting field H will be equal to the graphical sum of field H1, H2 and H3.
Figure 1.12 shows this graphic sum for six successive steps
Figure 1.12
At instant (1), figure 1.12 shows that the field H1 is at its maximum whereas fields H2 and H3 are negative and have the same value: 0.5. The resulting field (graphic sum) is shown in the upper part of figure 1.12 (1) and has the same direction as the winding of phase 1.
Repeating this procedure for the instants 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6
of figure 1.7 we can see that the resulting field H presents a constant intensity, but its direction keeps rotating to complete a whole turn at the end of a cycle.
We can, therefore, conclude that a three-phase winding fed from three-phase currents generates a "rotating field" as if one single pair of poles was present, rotating and fed with a constant current. This rotating field, generated by the three- phase stator winding, induces certain voltages into the rotor bars (magnetic flux lines go through the rotor bars) which, being short-circuited, generate currents and, as a consequence, create a field on the rotor with reverse polarity if compared with the rotating field polarity. Since opposite fields attract
each other and considering the stator field (rotating field) is rotative, the rotor tends to follow the speed of this field. The result of this is that motor torque is created in the rotor that makes it rotate and then drive the load.
1.5.2 Synchronous Speed ( ns )
The synchronous speed of the motor is defined by the rotation speed of the rotating field which depends on the number
of poles (2p) of the motor and on the line frequency (f) in Hertz. The field makes a complete revolution at each cycle and “f” is the system frequency in cycles per second (Hertz). Winding may have more than one pair of poles which can be alternately distributed (one “North” and one “South”) along the circumference of the magnetic core. Since the rotating field runs through one pair of poles at each cycle and the winding has poles or “p” pair of poles, the speed of the field is:
ns
=
60 . f p
=
120 . f 2 p
( rpm )
  Examples:
a ) What is the synchronous speed of a six-pole motor, 50 Hz?
ns
120 . 50
= = 1000 rpm
 6
b ) A twelve-pole motor, 60 Hz?
120 . 60 12
It must be remembered that the number of poles of a motor must always be an even number in order to form pairs of poles. The table 1.3 shows the synchronous speed of the more common number of poles at 60 Hz and 50 Hz.
Table 1.3 - Synchronous speed
For 2-pole motors, as in item 1.5.1, the field turns by one complete revolution at each cycle. Thus, electrical degrees are equivalent to mechanical degrees. For motors with more than 2 poles, a smaller “geometrical” revolution is realized by the field.
For example:
For a 6-pole motor, we will have, in a complete cycle, a field revolution of 360o x 2/6 = 120 geometrical degrees. This is equivalent to 1/3 of the speed in 2 poles. We conclude, then, that:
Geometrical degrees = Mechanical degrees x p

1.5.3 Slip ( s )
If the motor runs at a speed different from the synchronous speed, i.e. differing from the speed of the rotating field,
the rotor winding “cut” the magnetic force lines of the field and so, according to the electromagnetism laws, induced currents will flow through the rotor winding. The heavier the load the higher must be the required torque to move it.
To obtain a higher torque, the speed difference must be greater so that induced current and the generated field becomes higher. Therefore, as the load increases, the motor speed decreases. When the load is at zero (motor at no-load) the rotor practically rotates at its synchronous speed.
The difference between motor speed (n) and synchronous speed (ns) is called slip (s), expressed as rpm or fraction of the synchronous speed or as a percentage of the synchronous speed:
When we refer to motor lifetime reduction, we do not refer specifically to excessively high temperatures resulting in sudden insulation burn out. Insulation lifetime (in terms of operating temperature much below the one affecting the insulation) refers to permanent aging of the insulation material which becomes dry and loses its insulation properties. As
a result, it will not withstand the voltage applied to it, thus causing short-circuit.
Experience shows that the insulation has a practically unlimited duration, if its temperature is kept below the limit
of its thermal class. Any increasing value above such a limit will reduce the insulation lifetime proportionally. Such a limit of temperature is much lower than the temperature that causes insulation burnout and it depends on the type of used material. This limit of temperature refers to insulation's hottest spot and not necessarily to the whole insulation. On the
other hand, a single weak spot in the insulation is enough to damage the winding completely.
With the increasing use of frequency inverters for the speed control of induction motors, other application criteria must also be considered for the preservation of the insulation system. For more details see “Influence of the frequency inverter on the motor insulation”.
1.6.1 Insulation Material
The insulation material prevents, limits and directs the electric current flux. Although the insulating material is primarily intended to block the current flux from a cable to the ground or to the lowest potential, it also serves to provide mechanical support, protect the cable from degradation caused by the environment's influences and to transfer the heat to the external environment.
Based on system requirements, gases, liquids, and solid materials are used to insulate electric equipment. Insulation systems affect the quality of the equipment, and the type and quality of the insulation affect the cost, weight, performance and useful lifetime.
1.6.2 Insulation System
A combination of two or more insulation materials applied to an electric equipment is designated insulation system.
This combination on an electric motor consists in magnet wire, insulation of the slot, insulation of the slot closing,
face to face insulation, varnish and/or impregnation resin, insulation of the connection leads and welding insulation. Any material or component that is not in contact with the coil is not considered as part of the insulation system.
1.6.3 Thermal Classes
Since the temperature of electro-mechanical products is basically the predominant factor for the aging of the insulation material and insulation system, certain basic thermal classifications are recognized and applied all over the world.
ns - n
s ( rpm ) = ns - n ; s =

1.6 Insulation Materials and Insulation Systems
Considering that an induction motor is a simple designed and rugged construction machine, its lifetime will exclusively depend on the quality level of the insulation materials. Motor insulation is affected by several factors including moisture, vibration, corrosive environments, and others. Among all these factors, the operating temperature of the insulating materials is the most critical.
The motor lifetime is reduced by half when subject 8% to 10 oC in operation above the rated temperature of the class of insulating material. To ensure a longer lifetime for the electric motor, the use of thermal sensors is recommended for the winding protection.
 Specification of Electric Motors 15

www.weg.net
Insulation materials and insulation system are classified based on the resistance to temperature for a long period of time. The standards listed below refers to the classification of materials and insulation systems:
Table 1.4 - Standards for materials and insulation system
The thermal classes defined for the materials and insulation systems are the following:
1.6.5 WEG Insulation System
In order to meet different market requirements and specific applications, associated to an excellent technical performance, nine insulation systems are used for
WEG motors.
The round enameled wire is one of the most important components used in the motor since the electric current flows through it and creates the magnetic field required for motor operation. During the production process, the wires are submitted to mechanical traction efforts, flexion and abrasion electrical effects that also affect the wire insulating material. During the operation, the thermal and electrical effects act on the wire insulation material. For this reasons, the wire requires an outstanding mechanical, thermal and electrical insulation resistance.
The enamel used currently on the wire ensures such properties, where the mechanical property is assured by the outside enamel coat that resists to abrasion effects while inserting it into the stator slots. The internal enamel coat ensures high dielectric resistance and the set provides thermal class 200 oC to the wire (UL File E234451). This wire is used for all Class B, F and H motors. Smoke Extraction Motors are built with special wire for extremely high temperatures.
Films and laminated insulating materials are intended to isolate thermally and electrically all motor winding parts. The thermal class is indicated on the motor nameplate. These films are aramid and polyester based films and also laminated films are applied to the following areas:
g between the coils and the slot (slot bottom film) to insulate
the lamination core ( ground ) from the enameled wire coil; g between phases: to isolate electrically one phase from the
other phase
g Closing of the stator slot to insulate electrically that coil
placed on the top of the stator and for mechanical purposes so as to keep the wires inside the stator slot.

It is understood that the thermal class represents the maximum temperature that the electromechanical equipment can reach on its hottest spot when operating at rated load without reducing its lifetime. The thermal classification of a material or system is based on a comparison with well-known reference systems or materials. However, for those cases where there is not any reference material, the thermal class can be obtained by exploiting the damage curve (Arhenius Graphic) for a certain time period (IEC 216 specifies 20,000/hours).
1.6.4 Insulating Materials in Insulation Systems
The specification of a product within a certain thermal class does not mean that each insulating material used has the same thermal capacity ( thermal class ). The temperature limit for an insulation system can not be directly related
to the thermal capacity of the individual materials in this system. In a system the thermal performance of a material can be improved by protective characteristics of certain material used with this material. For example: a 155 oC class material can have its performance improved when the set is impregnated with varnish for class 180 oC.
 16 Specification of Electric Motors

The impregnation varnishes and resins are mainly intended to maintain all enameled wire coil as a block with all stator components through agglutination of such materials and to fill all voids inside the slot.
This agglutination avoids vibration and friction between the wires. Such friction could cause failures on the wire enamel, then resulting in a short-circuit.
The agglutination (filling of voids) also helps the heat dissipation generated by the wire and mainly, when motors are fed by frequency inverter, prevents/reduces the formation of partial discharges (corona effect) inside the motor.
Two types of varnishes and two types of impregnation varnishes are currently used; all of them are polyester varnishes so as to meet motor construction and application requirements. Silicon resin is only used for special motors designed for very high temperatures.
Varnishes and resins usually improve thermal and electrical characteristics of the impregnated materials in such a way to classify these impregnated materials in higher thermal class if compared to the same materials without impregnation.
The varnishes are applied by the immersion impregnation process and then oven-dried. Solventless resins are applied by the continuous flow process.
Figure 1.12.b - Immersion impregnation process
Figure 1.12.c - Resin applied by continuous flow process
The connection leads consist of elastomeric insulation materials that have the same thermal class as the motor. These materials are exclusively used to insulate electrically the lead from the external environment. They have high electric resistance and proper flexibility to allow easy handling during manufacturing process, installation and motor maintenance.
For certain applications, such as submersible pumps, the leads must be chemically resistant to the oil of the pump. The flexible pipes are intended to cover and insulate electrically the welded connections between the coils wires and the leads and the connections between wires. They are flexible to allow them to get shaped to welding points and to the coil head tying. Three types of pipes are currently used:
g Heat-shrink polyester tubing - Class of 130 oC
g Polyester tube coated with acrylic resin - Class of 155 oC
g Fiberglass tube coated with silicon rubber - Class of 180 oC

2. Power Supply Characteristics
2.1 Power Supply System
The power supply system can be single or three-phase. Single-phase system is mostly used in homes, commercial centers, farms, while three-phase system is used in industries. Both operate at 60 Hz or 50 Hz.
2.1.1 Three-Phase System
The three-phase voltages mostly used in industries are: g Low voltage: 220 V, 380 V and 440 V
g High voltage: 2.300 V, 4.160 V and 6.600 V
The star connected three-phase low voltage system consists of three-phase leads (L1, L2, L3) and a neutral conductor
(N). The last one is connected to the generator star point or to the transformer secondary winding (as shown in figure Figure 2.1).
Figure 2.1 - Three-phase system
2.1.2 Single-Phase System
Single phase motors are connected to two phases (UL line voltage) or to one phase and to neutral conductor (Uf phase voltage). So the single-phase motor rated voltage must be equal to UL or Uf system voltage. When several single-phase motors are connected to a three-phase system (formed by
3 single-phase systems), care must be taken in order to distribute them uniformly so as to avoid unbalance between phases.
Single wire earth return (SWER)
The single-phase earth return (SWER) is an electric system where the ground lead operates as return lead for the load current. This is applied as solution for the use of single-phase motors from power supply not having neutral available. Depending on the available electric system and on the characteristics of the soil where it will be installed (usually on farm power supply), we have:
a ) Single cable system
The single wire earth return ( SWER ) system is considered the practical and economical option. However, it can be used only where the origin substation outlet is star grounded.
Figure 2.2 - Single cable system
b ) Single cable system with insulation transformer
Besides requiring a transformer, this system has a few disadvantages such as:
g Link power limitation to isolation transformer rated power; g The grounding system of the isolation transformer must be
reinforced. Lack of this will result in absence of energy to the whole link.
Figure 2.3 - Single cable system with insulation transformer
c ) Single wire earth return (SWER) system with partial neutral
It is applied as a solution of the use of single wire earth return (SWER) system in regions with land (soil) of high resistivity when it is difficult to get ground resistance values of the transformer within the maximum design limits.

3. Characteristics of the Electric Motor Power Supply
3.1 Rated Voltage
This is the line voltage for which the motor has been designed.
3.1.1 Multiple Rated Voltage
Motors are generally supplied with sufficient terminals to enable alternative connections. This means that they can operate on at least two different voltages. The main types of alternative terminal connections are:
a ) Series-parallel connection
The winding of each phase is divided into two equal parts (halves) (please consider that the number of poles is always a multiple of two, so this type of connection is always possible). g By connecting the two halves in series, each half will have a
voltage to the half rated phase voltage of the motor;
g By connecting the two halves in parallel, the motor can be supplied with a voltage equal to one half of the previous voltage, without affecting the voltage applied to each coil.
(refer to examples given in figures 3.1a and b).

 Figure 3.1a - Series-parallel connection Y
c ) Triple rated voltage
The two previous alternative connection arrangements can be obtained in one motor if the winding of each phase is divided into two halves enabling series-parallel connection. All terminals have to be accessible so that the three phases can be connected in star or delta. This means that there can be four alternatives for rated voltage:
1 ) Parallel-delta connection;
2 ) Star-parallel connection, being the rated voltage equal
to√ 3 x the first one;
3 ) Series-delta connection, i. e. the rated voltage being
twice the value of the first one;
4 ) Series-star connection, the rated voltage is equal to √ 3 x
the third one. However as this voltage would be higher the 690 V, it is only indicated as reference for star-delta connection.
Example: 220/380/440( 760 ) V
Note: 760 V ( only for starting )
This type of connection requires twelve terminals and
Fig. 2.7 shows the normal numbering on the terminals as well as the connection diagram for the three rated voltages.
Figure 3.3
3.2 Rated Frequency ( Hz )
This is the network frequency for which the motor has been designed.
3.2.1 Connection to Different Frequencies
Three-phase motors wound for 50 Hz can also be connected to a 60 Hz network,
a ) By connecting a 50 Hz motor, of the same voltage, to a 60 Hz network, the motor performance will be as follows:
g same output;
g same rated current;
g starting current decreases 17%;
g starting torque decreases 17%;
g breakdown torque decreases 17%; g rated speed increases 20%.
Note: please consider the required outputs for motors that drive machines with variable torque and speed.
b ) If voltage changes proportionally to frequency, the performance will be:
g motor output increase 20%;
g rated current is the same;
g starting current will be approximately the same;
g starting torque will be approximately the same;
g breakdown torque will be approximately the same; g rated speed increases 20%.
Figure 3.1b - Series-parallel connection Δ
This type of connection requires nine terminals on the motor. The most common dual voltage system is 220/440 V, i. e. the motor is parallel connected when supplied for 220 V, or alternatively, it is series connected when supplied for 440 V. Fig. 3.1a and 3.1b show normal terminal numbering, as well as connection diagrams for this type of motor - both for star or delta connected motors. The same diagrams apply to any other two voltages, provided that one is the double of the other, e.g. 230/460 V.
b ) Star-Delta connection
Two ends of each phase winding are brought out to terminals. By connecting the three phases in delta, each phase receives total line voltage, e.g. 220 volts ( Fig. 3.2 ). By connecting the three phases in star, the motor can be connected to a line voltage of 220 x√ 3 = 380 V. The winding voltage remains at 220 volts per phase.
Uf = U √ 3
Figure 3.2 - Star-delta connection Y - Δ
This type of connection requires six terminals on the motor and is suitable for any dual voltage provided that the second voltage be equal to the first voltage multiplied by√ 3 ).
Examples: 220/380 V - 380/660 V - 440/760 V
In the example 440/760 V, the stated higher voltage is used to indicate that the motor can be driven by star-delta switch.

3.3 Voltage and Frequency Variation Tolerance
As per standard IEC 60034-1, for induction motors, the combinations of voltage and frequency variations are classified as Zone A or Zone B (figure 3.4).
3.4 Three-Phase Motor Starting Current Limitation
Whenever possible a squirrel cage three-phase motor should be started direct online (D.O.L.) by means of contactors.
It must be taken into account that for a certain motor the torque and current values are fixed, irrespective the load, for a constant voltage. In cases where the motor starting current is excessively high, harmful consequences may occur:
a ) High voltage drop in the power supply system. Due to that, equipment connected to the system may be affected;
b ) The protection system (cables, contactors) must be overdesigned resulting in higher cost;
c ) Utilities regulations limiting the line voltage drop.
If D.O.L starting is not possible due to these problems, indirect connection system can be used so as to reduce starting current

(440 V) You must use connection "A" (protection by 3 fuses). For higher outputs you must use the connection "B" (protection by 6 fuses), where the fuse set F1, F2, F3 is equal to the fuse set F4, F5, F6.

When starting by the Star-Delta method it is essential that the motor windings are suitable for operating on a dual voltage, e.g. 220/380 V, 380/660 V or 440/760 V. Motors must have at least six connection terminals. Star-Delta starting can be used if the torque is high enough to ensure the machine acceleration with reduced current. When star-connected, the current is reduced to 25-33% of the starting current reached when Delta connected.

The resistive load torque can not exceed the motor starting torque (figure 3.9) and during the delta commutation process the achieved values can not exceed the allowed one.
On the other hand, there are cases where this staring method can not be used, as shown in figure 3.10.
current, which was approximately 50%, increases to
170%, i. e., practically equal to the starting current in Y.
In this case, the star-delta connection has some advantages, because if it was D.O.L. connected, it would absorb 600%
of the rated current. The Star-Delta starter can only be used for starting machines at no loads. In the case of starting at no load, the load can only be applied after the motor has reached 90% of its rated speed. The commutation point from star to delta connection must be determined carefully in order to ensure that this starting method is effectively advantageous in cases where D.O.L starting is not possible. For triple rated voltage motors ( 220/380/440/760 V, connection must be at 220/380 V or 440/760 V, depending on the power supply.

Figure 3.11 shows a high resistive torque Cr.
If the motor is started in star connection it will accelerate the load up to approximately 85% of the rated speed. At this point the starter must be switched to delta. In this example, the current ( which is close to its rated value - e.g. 100% ) jumps suddenly to 320% which is of no advantage since the starting current was only 190%.

Fig. 3.11 shows a motor with the same characteristics, however, the resistive torque CR is much lower. When connected to Y the motor accelerates the load up to 95% of the rated speed. When the starter is switched to Δ, the

 3.4.3 Compensating Switch (Autotransformer)
The compensating switch can be used to start motors under load. This switch reduces the staring current preventing overload on the circuit, however ensures that the motor has sufficient torque to star and accelerate the load.
The voltage on the compensating switch is reduced by the autotransformer which has taps of 50%, 65% and
80% of the rated voltage.
For motor starting with voltage below the rated one, starting current and torque must be multiplied by factor K1 ( current multiplying factor ) and K2 ( torque multiplying factors ) obtained on the chart of figure 3.15.

3.4.4 Comparing Star-Delta Starters and “Automatic” Autotransformers
1 ) Star-delta ( automatic )
Advantages
a ) Star-Delta starters are widely used due to their relatively
low price.
b ) There are no limits to the number of times they can be
operated.
c ) The components require very little space.
d ) The starting current is reduced to approximately one-third.
Disadvantages
a ) The starter can only be applied to motors where the six leads or terminals can be accessed.
b ) The supply voltage must be the same as the rated motor voltage for Delta connection.
c ) Because the starting current is reduced to approximately one-third of the rated current, the starting torque is also reduced to one-third.
d ) If the motor does not reach at least 90% of its rated speed at the time of switching from Star to Delta the current peak will be as high as in a D.O.L. start, thus causing harmful effects to the contacts of the contactors and the connection system brings no advantage to the electrical system.
2 ) Auto-transformer ( automatic )
Advantages:
a) On the 65% tapping the line current is approximately
equal tp that of a Star-Delta starter, however, at the time of switching from reduced voltage to the full supply voltage, the motor is not disconnected so that the second peak is very much reduced since the transformer is converted into reactance for a short time.
b ) It is possible to vary the tapping from 65% to 80% or even up to 90% of the supply voltage in order to ensure that the motor starts satisfactorily.
Disadvantages:
a ) One of its great disadvantages is the limitation of its operation frequency. It is always necessary to know the operation frequency in order to determine a suitably rated auto-transformer.
b ) The compensating switch is much more expensive than a Star-Delta starter due to the auto-transformer.
c ) Due to the size of the auto-transformer starter, much larger control panels are required which increases the price.

Figure 3.18 - Power circuit - series-parallel starter
The series-parallel connection requires the motor to be designed for two rated voltages, the lowest one is equal to the power supply voltage and the other is two times higher.
For this starting method the most common voltage is 220/440 V, i. e., on starting the motor is series connected until it reaches its rated speed and then it is switched to parallel connection.

3.4.6 Electronic Start ( Soft-Starter )
New discoveries in electronics have allowed the creation of the solid state starters consisting of a set of pairs of thyristors ( SCR ) or ( combination of thyristors / diodes ), one on each motor power terminals.
The trigger angle of each pair of thyristors is controlled electronically for applying a variable voltage to the motor terminals during the “acceleration”. At the end of the start period, adjustable typically between 2 and 30 seconds, the voltage reaches its rated value with a smooth acceleration ramp instead of being submitted to increments or sudden peaks. Applying such starting method the starting current
( line current ) remains close to the rated current with only smooth variation. Besides the advantage of the voltage
( current ) control during the start, the electronic switch also has the advantage of not having movable parts or parts that generate electric arcs as the mechanical switches. This is one of the strengths of the electronic switches, since their lifetime becomes longer.

3.5 Direction of Rotation of Three-Phase Induction Motors
Depending on the electric connection configuration, a three-phase induction motor can operate at any direction
of rotation. The direction of rotation can be reversed by exchanging the position of two of the connecting leads.
WEG motors are supplied with bi-directional fans unless
only one direction of rotation is informed on the data sheet
or on additional nameplates. In general the motor allow the operation at any direction of rotation without affecting the motor cooling. Motors without fan, but ventilated by the own load ( the fan is the load ) must meet the cooling requirements of the motor, independent of the direction of rotation. In case of doubt, contact WEG

4.1.1 Torque X Speed Curve
Definition
The induction motor has zero torque at synchronous speed. As the load increases, the motor speed will decrease gradually until the torque reaches the maximum value
which the motor is capable of developing at normal speed.
If the load torque continues to increase, the motor speed
will suddenly decrease and may even lock the rotor. By graphically representing the torque variation with the speed for a normal motor, we obtain a curve as shown in Figure 4.1.

This torque can be indicated in Nm or more frequently as percentage of the rated torque.

In practice, the locked rotor torque should be as high as possible to enable the rotor to overcome the initial load inertia, and quickly accelerate it, especially when started with reduced voltage.

Cmin: minimum torque or pull up torque: - This is the smallest torque developed by the motor when accelerating from rest or zero speed to the speed corresponding to maximum torque. In practice this value must not be very
low, i.e. the speed torque curve should not have a strong depression during acceleration otherwise starting time is too long, resulting in overheating of the motor, especially in cases of high inertia, or starting on reduced voltage.
Cmáx: maximum torque or breakdown torque - This is the maximum torque developed by the motor at rated voltage and frequency, without an abrupt drop in speed.
In practice maximum torque must be as high as possible for two reasons:
1 ) The motor must be able to easily overcome loading peaks which can occasionally occur with crushers, calandering machines, mixers, etc.
2 ) The motor speed should not oscillate, i. e., the speed should not drop abruptly when momentary and excessive voltage drops occur.
4.1.2 Designs - Minimum Standardized Torque Values
Based on their torque characteristics in relation to the speed and starting current, three-phase squirrel cage induction motors are classified into designs, each one complying with a specific type of load. Defined by IEC 60034-1 Standard, the designs are the following:
Design N
Regular locked rotor torque, regular locked rotor current, low slip. These are the most common motors in the market and are used in applications such as pumps, machine tools fans, etc.
Design H
High locked rotor torque, regular locked rotor current, low slip. The motors with this design are used on applications that require high starting torques such as screens, conveyors, high inertia loads, crushers, etc.
Design D
High locked rotor torque, regular locked rotor current, high slip ( above 5% ). Used on applications such as eccentric presses and similar machines that have periodic load peaks. These motors are also used on elevators and loads that require high starting torque and limited locked rotor current. Figure 4.2 shows the torque curves x speed of the different designs.

26 Specification of Electric Motors
This design includes motors similar to those of N design; however, they are designed for star-delta starting. For these motors at star connection, the minimum torque values with locked rotor and the pull-in torque values are equal to 25% of the values indicated for Design N motors.
Design HY
This design includes motors similar to those of design N; however, they are designed for star-delta starting. For these motors at star connection, the minimum torque values with locked rotor and the pull-in torque values are equal to 25% of the values indicated for H Design motors.
The minimum torque values required for design N and design H motors, as specified in IEC 60034-1 standard, are shown in tables 4.1and 4.2.
For 4, 6 and 8-pole design D motors and rated power of 150 HP and below, IEC 60034 -1 states that: the locked rotor torque ( Cp ) shall not be lower than 2.75 of the motor rated torque ( Cn, ). Pull-up torque ( Cmín ) and breakdown torque
( Cmáx ) are not regulated by this standard.
IEC 60034-1 does not specify minimum torque values required for 2-poles, design H and design D motors.

4.1.3 Characteristics of WEG Motors
Although WEG states that their motors usually comply with Design N, in many cases their typical actual torque values far exceed the minimum required by the standard. In most cases
the values even exceed the minimum requirements of Design H. This means a very high speed-torque curve, bringing the following benefits:
1 ) Quick acceleration under heavy starting conditions, e.g. for piston pumps, loaded conveyors, high inertia loads, compressors with open valves, etc.
2) Quick responsiveness for special supplies such as those mentioned since standard motors are always readily available from stock, with price benefits and quick delivery.
3 ) The possibility of using reduced voltage starting methods, e.g. Star-Delta Starters, in normal cases, without affecting perfect load acceleration.
4 ) Due to the high value of the breakdown torque, momentary load peaks and temporary voltage drops
are accepted without any sudden speed loss. This is a fundamental requirement for the performance of machines that are subjected to heavy load peaks, such as crushers, calender machines, etc.
4.2 Load Inertia
The driven load inertia is one of the most important characteristics to be checked during the acceleration time to ensure that the motor will be able to drive the load within the ambient requirements or the thermal capabilities of the insulation materials.
Inertia is the way how we measure the resistance of an object to change its rotation movement around a shaft. It also depends on the shaft around which it is rotating, the shape of the object and the way its mass is distributed. The unit of the inertia moment is given by kgm2.
The total inertia of the system is given by the load inertia plus
In cases where the machine has “different speed than the motor” (ex.: belt/pulley assembly or gearboxes), inertia has to be considered for the motor rated speed as indicated below:
Figure 4.3 - Inertia at different speeds

Nm Nm Nm Nm
where:Jce - Load inertia related to the motor shaft Jc - Load inertia
Nc - Load speed
Nm - Motor rated speed
The total inertia of the load is essential for determining the acceleration time.
4.3 Acceleration Time
In order to check if the motor is suitable to drive the load, or when designing the installation, starting or protection system, the acceleration time must be known (from the moment
the motor starts and accelerates up to the rated speed).
The starting time can be determined approximately by the average acceleration torque.

 The average acceleration torque can be obtained from the difference of motor torque and the load torque. It should be calculated for each rotation interval ( the sum of the intervals would give the total acceleration time ). In practical terms, it
is enough to calculate graphically the average torque, i.e., the difference between motor average torque and load average torque. This average can be obtained graphically, by ensuring that the sum as the areas A1 and A2 is the same of area A3 and that the area B1 is the same as the area B2 (see figure 4.5).

Due to high starting currents on electric induction motors, the time required to accelerate high inertia loads will result in a sudden motor temperature rise. If the interval between successive starts is very short, the motor winding can experience some overheating that will cause some damage or reduce their lifetime. IEC 60034-1 Standard establishes a minimum number of starts ( S1 ) that the motors should withstand in the following conditions:
a ) Two consecutive starts: first start with the motor in cold state, i.e., with the winding at ambient temperature and the second start right after, but with de-energized motor and at rest.
b ) One hot start, i.e., with the winding at running temperature.
The first condition simulates the case when the first start fails, for example, the protection system trips, allowing a second start right after. The second condition simulates the case of an accidental motor shutdown during normal operation, for example, due to a power supply fault, allowing to start the motor again right after the power supply is re-established.
As the motor temperature rise depends on the inertia of the driven load, the standard establishes the maximum load inertia to which the motors should withstand in order to comply with the conditions above. Table 4.3 shows the inertia values for 2, 4, 6 and 8-pole motors.

The motors must have their number of starts per hour limited according to their duty indicated on the nameplate and/or as agreed for the design.
Excessive starts can cause overheating and consequent burning of the electric motor.

5.1.1 Two Speed Motors with Independent Winding
This type of motor has the advantage of combining winding with any number of poles; however, it is limited by core dimensioning (stator/rotor) and by the frame size that is usually far greater than the frame of a single-speed motor.
5.1.2 Dahlander
Two-speed motors with commutating pole winding is the most used system, also called "Dahlander connection." This connection provides a ratio of a number poles ratio of 1:2 with a consequent speed ratio 2:1.
It can be connected as follows (Figure 5.1):
www.weg.net
 kVA/cv = √ 3 Ip . U P ( cv ) . 1000
kVA/kW = √ 3 Ip . U
P ( kW ) . 1000
where: Ip - Locked rotor current or starting current U - Rated voltage ( V )
P- Rated power ( HP or kW )
Table 4.4 - Maximum values of the locked rotor apparent Power ( Sp / Pn ), expressed as per the unit value of the rated output ( Pn )
Note: to obtain the ratio Ip / In , multiply kVA/kW by the performance product and by the Power factor at full load.
Ip = Locked rotor current; In = Rated current
5. Speed Regulation of Asynchronous Motors
The relationship between speed, frequency, number of poles and slip is given by:
2
( 2p )
where : n = rpm
f = frequency ( Hz )
2p = number of poles s = slip
The formula shows that for the speed regulation of asynchronous motors, we can change the following parameters:
a ) 2p = number of poles
b ) s = slip
c ) f = frequency ( Hz )
5.1 Changing the Number of Poles
There are three ways to change the number of poles of an asynchronous motor, as follows:
g separated stator winding;
g one winding with pole commutation;
g combination of the two options above.
In all these cases, the speed regulation will be smooth, without losses, but frame size will be larger than for a single-speed motor.

g Constant torque
Torque is constant on both speeds and power ratio is 0.63:1. In this case, the motor is D/YY connected.
Example:
0.63/1HP motor - 4/2 poles - D/YY.
This connection is suitable for applications where the load torque curve remains constant with the speed variation.
g Constant power
In this case, the torque ratio is 2:1 and horsepower remains constant. The motor is YY/D connected.
Example: 10/10 HP - 4/2 poles - YY/Δ.

g Variable torque
In this case, the power ratio will be approximately 1:4. It is applied to loads such as pumps and fans.
The connection, in this case, is Y/YY.
Example: 1/4 HP - 4/2 poles - Y/YY.
5.1.3 Motors with Two or More Speeds
It is possible to combine a Dahlander winding with a single winding or more. However, this type of motor is not usual and is used only for special applications.
5.2 Slip Variation
In this case, the rotating field speed is maintained constant, and the rotor speed is changed according to
the conditions required by the load, which can be:
a ) rotor resistance variation
b ) stator voltage variation
c ) variation of both simultaneously.
These variations are achieved by increasing rotor losses which limit the use of this system.
5.2.1 Rotor Resistance Variation
This method is used for slip ring motors and is based on the following equation:
5.2.2 Stator Voltage Variation
This is not a usual method since it also generates rotor losses and the speed variation range is small.
5.3 Frequency Inverters
For further information about the use of frequency inverters for speed control, see chapter "Application of induction motors fed by frequency inverters".
6. Brake Motor
The brake motor consists of an induction motor coupled to
a single-disc brake, forming an integral, compact unit. The induction motor is a totally enclosed fan cooled machine with the same mechanical and electrical performance of WEG general purpose motors.
The brake is built with few movable parts which give long
life with reduced maintenance. The two faces of the brake pads create a large contact area, requiring only little pressure during the braking process, which reduces the brake heating and the wear is minimal. Besides that, the brake is cooled
by the motor cooling system. The electromagnet drive coil, protected with epoxy resin, can be operated continuously with voltages varying 10% above and below the rated voltage.
The electromagnet drive coil is DC powered, supplied by
a bridge rectifier made of silicon diodes and varistors, that suppress undesirable voltage spikes and allow a fast current shutdown. The DC power supply provides a faster and smoother brake operation.
The typical applications for brake motors: g Machine-tools
g Looms
g Packing machines
g Conveyors
g Bottle washing and filling machines g Winding machines
g Bending machines
g Hoists
g Cranes
g Lifts
g Roll adjustment of rolling machines g Graphic machines
In general terms, brake motors are used on equipment requiring quick stops based on safety, positioning and time- saving factors.

6.1 Brake Operation
When the motor is disconnected from the power supply,
the control also switches off the coil current and the electromagnet stops operating. The pressure springs force the armature towards the motor non-drive-end shield.
Fitted in the braking disc, the braking pads are compressed between the two friction surfaces, the armature, and the end shield braking the motor until it stops. When the motor is switched on, the coil is powered and the armature is pulled against the electromagnet frame by eliminating the spring force. Once they are free, the braking pads move axially in their seating, and they remain out of the friction area. Now the braking process is ended and allows starting the motor freely. As optional, WEG can supply the motors with brake lining.
6.2 Connection Diagram
The WEG brake motor allows 3 types of connection diagrams supplying slow, medium and quick braking.
a ) Slow braking
The power supply of the brake coil bridge rectifier is applied directly from the motor terminals, without interruption, as shown below:
D - Bridge rectifier
L - Electromagnet coil K - Contactor
Figure 6.1 - Connection diagram for slow braking
b ) Medium braking
In this case, a contact for interruption of the bridge rectifier supply current in the AC circuit is interconnected. It is essential that this is a NO auxiliary contact (S1) of the contactor itself or of the motor magnetic switch in order
to allow switching on and off of the brake and motor simultaneously.
 D - Bridge rectifier
L - Electromagnet coil
K - Contactor
S1- NO auxiliary contact
Figure 6.2 - Connection diagram for medium braking
c ) Fast braking
A contact for interruption is directly connected to one of the coil supply cables in the DC circuit. It is essential that this is a NO auxiliary contact of the contactor itself or a magnetic switch of the motor.
      32 Specification of Electric Motors
D - Bridge rectifier
L - Electromagnet coil
K - Contactor
S1 - NO auxiliary contact
Figure 6.3 - Connection diagram for fast braking

6.3 Brake Coil Power Supply
The power supply of the bridge rectifier with AC-current can be obtained from an independent source or from the motor terminals. This power supply may be in 110/220 V, 440 V or 575 V, according to the characteristics of the bridge rectifier/ brake coil set.
The brake coil can also be supplied for 24 V DC, but in this case, the power supply should be provided through an independent source (direct current), eliminating the use of bridge rectifier (RB).
Through motor terminals
a ) Motor 220/380 V: connect motor terminal 1 and 2 of the RB (220 V AC) between the terminals 1 and 4 of the motor.
b ) Motor 380/660 V: connect motor terminal 1 and 2 of the RB (220 V AC) between the terminal 2 and the neutral.
c ) Motor 220/380/440/760 V: connect the motor terminals 1 and 2 of the RB (220 V AC) between the terminals 1 and 4 of the motor.
d ) Motor with 3 leads (single voltage): connect the terminals 1 and 2 of the RB between the 1 and 2 of the motor (if the RB has the Same voltage of the motor).
e ) Two-speed motor 220 V (RB 220 V AC):
1. High speed: connect between the motor terminals 4 and 6. 2. Low speed: connect between the motor terminals 1 and 2.
Motor 440 V: connect the terminals of the rectifier bridge (440 V AC) to the motor terminals.
Independent power supply (AC):
For motors of other voltages, connect the terminals of the rectifier bridge to the independent 220 V power supply; however, always with the simultaneous interruption when the motor power supply is switched off. With independent power supply, it is possible to electrically release the brake, as shown in figure 6.4.

Figure 6.4 - Connection diagram for independent power supply
6.4 Brake Torque
It is possible to obtain a smoother motor stop by reducing the braking torque value. This is achieved by removing some brake pressure springs.
Important!
The springs must be removed in such a way that the remaining ones stay symmetrically arranged, avoiding in this way any friction even after operating the motor and thus avoid uneven wear of the braking pads.
6.5 Air Gap Adjustment
WEG brake motors are supplied with an initial factory set air gap, that is, the gap between the armature and the frame with the energized brake are pre-adjusted at the factory to the minimum value as indicated in Table 6.1.
As they are simple construction machines, brake motors require low maintenance. Only a periodical air gap adjustment is required. It is recommended to clean internally the brake motor in cases of penetration of water, dust, etc. or at the time motor when the periodical maintenance is carried out.

   Table 6.1
Due to the natural wear of the braking pads, the size of the air gap gradually increases without affecting the performance of the brake until it reaches the maximum value shown in Table 6.1. To adjust the air gap to its initial value, proceed as follows:
a ) Unfasten the bolts and remove the fan cover;
b ) Remove the seal ring;
c ) Measure the air gap at three points, near the adjustment
screws, using a set of feeler gauges;
d ) If the gap width is equal to or greater than the maximum
indicated dimension, or if the three readings are not the
same, proceed the adjustment as follows:
1. loosen the lock nuts and the adjustment screws; 2. adjust the air gap to the initial value indicated in
Table 6 .1 tightening by equally the three adjustment screws. The value of the air gap must be uniform at the three measured points, and must be such that the feeler gauge corresponding to the minimum gap, moves freely and the feeler gauge corresponding to the maximum gap cannot be inserted into the measured points;
3. tighten the locking bolts screws until the ends touch the motor end shield. Do not overtighten them;
 Specification of Electric Motors 33

www.weg.net
4. Tighten the lock nuts;
5. Re-check the air gap to ensure the measurements are
as per Item 2 above;
6. Remount the seal ring;
7. Remount the fan cover and fasten it with its fixing bolts.
The interval between periodical adjustments of the air gap, i.e., the number of braking cycles until brake pads wear
to their maximum allowed value depends on the load, the frequency of operations, and the cleanness of the working environment, etc. The ideal interval can only be determined by closely following up the performance of the brake motor during the first months of operation under actual working conditions. The wear of the brake pads also depends on the moment of inertia of the load.
WEG is also able to supply other brake options for more severe applications (e.g., cranes, tractors, gearboxes, etc.). In case of doubt, please contact WEG.
7. Operating Characteristics
7.1.1 Winding Heating Up
Losses
The effective or useful power output supplied by the motor
at the shaft end is lower than the power input absorbed by
the motor from the power supply, i. e., the motor efficiency is always below 100%. The difference between input and output represents the losses that are transformed into heat. This
heat warms up the winding and therefore must be removed from the motor to avoid excessive temperature rise. This
heat removal must be ensured for all types of motors. In the automobile engine, for example, the heat generated by internal losses has to be removed from the engine block by water flow through the radiator or by the fan, in the case of air-cooled engines.
Heat dissipation
The heat generated by internal losses is dissipated to the ambient air through the external surface of the frame. In totally enclosed motors this dissipation is usually aided by a shaft mounted fan. Good heat dissipation depends on:
g Efficiency of the ventilating system;
g Total heat dissipation area of the frame;
g Temperature difference between the external surface of the
frame and the ambient air ( text - ta ).
a ) A well-designed ventilation system, as well as having an efficient fan capable of driving a large volume of air, must direct this air over the entire circumference of the frame to achieve the required heat exchange.
A large volume of air is absolutely useless if it is allowed to spread out without dissipating the heat from the motor.
b ) The dissipation area must be as large as possible. However, a motor with a very large frame requires a very large cooling area and consequently will become too expensive, too heavy, and requires too much space for installation. To obtain the largest possible area while at the same time keeping the size and weight to a minimum ( an economic requirement ), cooling fins are cast around the frame.
c) An efficient cooling system is one that is capable of dissipating the largest possible amount of heat through the smallest dissipation area. Therefore, it is necessary that the internal drop in temperature, shown in figure 7.1, is minimized. This means that a good heat transfer must take place from the inside to the outer surface of the motor.
As explained, the objective is to reduce the internal drop in temperature ( i.e. to improve the heat transfer ) in order to obtain the largest possible drop of the outside temperature necessary for good heat dissipation. Internal drop in temperature depends on different factors which are indicated in figure 7.1 where the temperatures of certain important areas are shown and explained as follows:
Figure 7.1
  34 Specification of Electric Motors
A -
Thewindinghottestspotisinthecentreoftheslots where heat is generated as a result of losses in the conductors.
AB- The drop in temperature is due to the heat transfer from the hottest spot to the outer wires. As the air is a very poor conductor of heat it is very important to prevent voids inside the slots, i.e. the winding must be compact and perfectly impregnated with varnish.
B -
The drop in temperature through the slot insulation and through the contact of the insulation material with the conductors and by contact with the core lamination. By employing modern material far better heat transfer is obtained through the insulation materials. Perfect impregnation improves the contact of the inner side by eliminating voids. Perfect alignment of the lamination improves the contact to the outer side, eliminating layers of air, which have a negative effect on heat transfer.

BC - Drop in temperature by the transmission through the stator lamination material.
C - Dropintemperaturebycontactbetweenthestator core and the frame. Heat transmission depends on the perfect contact between the parts, good alignment
of the laminations, and accuracy in the machining
of the frame. Uneven surfaces leave empty spaces, resulting in poor contact and consequently bad heat transmission.
CD - Drop in temperature by the transmission through the frame thickness.
Due to modern design, use of first class material, improved manufacturing processes, and continuous quality control, WEG motors ensure excellent heat transfer properties from the motor inside to the outside thus eliminating “hot spots” in the windings.
Outer surface temperature of the motor
The figure 7.2 shows the recommended places where the outer surface temperature of an electric motor should be checked with calibrated temperature measuring instruments:
the insulation lifetime will shorten as the temperature increases. This temperature limit is well below the “burning” temperature of the insulation system and depends on the type of used insulation material.
This temperature limit refers to the hottest spot in the insulation system, but not necessarily to the whole winding. One weak point in the inner part of the winding will be enough to destroy the insulation system.
It is recommended to use temperature sensors as additional protection devices for the electric motor. These protection devices will ensure a longer lifetime and more process reliability.
The alarm and/or shutdown setting should be performed according to the motor temperature class. In case of doubt, contact WEG.
7.1.3 Insulation Classes
Insulation class definition
As previously mentioned the temperature limit depends on the type of used material used. In order to comply with the standards the insulation material and insulation systems (each one formed by a combination of several materials) are grouped in INSULATION CLASSES. Each one is defined
by the particular temperature limit, i.e. by the highest temperature that the insulation material or system can withstand continuously without affecting its useful life.
The insulation classes used for electrical machines and their respective temperature limits are in accordance with IEC 60034-1 are as follows:
Frame centre
Figure 7.2
Important!
D-enshield, near the bearing
www.weg.net
   Class A Class E Class B Class F Class H
( 105 oC ) ( 120 oC ) ( 130 oC ) ( 155 oC ) ( 180 oC )
 Measure also the ambient temperature (at a maximum distance of 1 m from the motor).
7.1.2 Motor Lifetime
As already informed in the Item “Insulation materials and insulation systems” its useful lifetime of the motor depends almost exclusively on the life of the winding insulation. The lifetime of a motor is affected by many factors, such as moisture, vibration, corrosive environments, and others. Among all these factors, the most important is the working temperature of the employed insulation materials. An increase from 8 to 10 degrees above the rated temperature class of the insulation system can reduce the motor lifetime by half.
When speaking about decreasing the useful lifetime of the motor, we are not talking about high temperatures where the insulation system burns and the winding are suddenly destroyed. For the insulation lifetime, this means gradual aging of the insulation material which becomes dry, losing its insulation properties
until it cannot withstand the applied voltage. This results in a breakdown of the insulation system and a consequent short- circuit of the winding. Experience shows that the insulation system has practically an unlimited lifetime if the temperature is kept below a certain limit if this temperature limit is exceeded,
7.1.4 Winding Temperature Rise Measurement
It would be rather difficult to measure the temperature of the winding with thermometers or thermocouples since the temperature differs from one spot to another and it is impossible to know if the measurement point is near the hottest spot. The most accurate and reliable method for determining the winding temperature is by measuring the variation of the winding resistance as a function of the temperature.
The temperature rise measurement by the resistance method, for copper conductors, is calculated according to the following formula:
R2 - R1 R1
Δt = t2 where: Δt =
t1 =
t2 = ta = R1 = R2 =
( 235 + t1 ) + t1 - ta
- ta =
 temperature rise;
winding temperature prior to testing, which should be practically equal to the cooling medium, measured by thermometer;
winding temperature at the conclusion of the test; temperature of the cooling medium at the conclusion of the test; winding resistance prior to testing;
winding resistance at the end of the test.
Specification of Electric Motors 35

www.weg.net
7.1.5 Electric Motor Application
The hottest spot temperature in the winding should be maintained below the maximum allowed temperature for
the insulation class. The total temperature is the sum of the ambient temperature, plus temperature rise (∆t), plus the difference existing between the average winding temperature and the hottest spot. Motor standards specify the maximum temperature rise ∆t, so the temperature of the hottest spot remains within the allowable limit based on the following considerations:
a ) Ambient temperature should not exceed 40 oC, as
per standard; above this value, working conditions are
considered as special operating conditions.
b ) The difference between the average temperature of the
winding and the hottest spot does not vary very much from the motor to motor and its value specified by the standard, is 5 oC for Classes A and E, 10 oC for Class B and F and 15 oC for Class H.
Therefore, motor standards specify a maximum allowed ambient temperature, as well as a maximum allowed temperature rise for each insulation class. Thus, the temperature of the hottest spot is indirectly limited.
The figures and the allowable temperature composition for the hottest spot are shown in Table 7.1 below:
Table 7.1 - Temperature composition as a function of the insulation class
For marine motors, all requirements specified by the classification societies must be considered, as shown in Table 7.2.
Table 7.2 - Temperature correction for marine motors
7.2 Thermal Protection of Electric Motors
Motors used for continuous duty must be protected
against overloads by a device integrated to the motor, or an independent device, usually fitted with a thermal relay having rated or setting current equal to or below the value obtained by multiplying the rated motor power supply current ( In ) by the Service Factor ( SF ), as shown in table below:
Table 7.3 - Power supply current x Service Factor
The thermal protection is provided by means of thermoresistances ( calibrated resistances ), thermistors, thermostats or thermal protectors. The temperature detectors to be used are defined in accordance with the temperature class of the insulation materials used for each type of machine as well as based on customer requirements.
7.2.1 Resistance Temperature Detector (Pt-100)
The temperature detectors operate on the principle that
the electrical resistance of a metallic conductor varies as
a function of the temperature (generally platinum, nickel or copper conductors). The temperature detectors are fitted with calibrated resistance which varies linearly with the temperature, allowing continuous follow up of motor heating on the controller display, with a high degree of accuracy and response sensitivity.
g
g
The same detector can be used for alarm (when the motor
is operated above the normal working temperature) and for tripping operation (usually set to the maximum temperature of the insulation class). The resistance of the cables, contacts, etc. can interfere with the measurement so there are different types of configurations that can be carried out to minimize these effects.
g
The two-wire configuration is usually satisfactory in places where the cable length to the sensor instrument does not exceed 3.0 m, using cables 20 AWG.
For the three-wire configuration ( commonly used in industry ) there will be compensation of the electrical resistance by the third wire.

7.2.2 Thermistors ( PTC and NTC )
Thermistors are temperature sensors consisting of semiconductor materials that vary its resistance very fast when reaching a certain temperature.

    36 Specification of Electric Motors

The “PTC” thermistors increase their resistance very fast
with temperature increase and some are characterized by
the abrupt resistance increase which makes them useful for thermal protection devices. The “NTC” thermistors reduce their resistance when the temperature increases. Thus, these thermal protection devices are used mostly to protect the motor against overheating.
The sudden change in resistance interrupts the current in
PTC, activates an output relay, which turns off the main circuit. Thermistors can be used for alarm and tripping purposes. For this purpose, two thermistors are required. They must be series connected, per phase.
The thermistors have reduced size, do not have mechanical wear, and provide a faster response when compared to other temperature sensors. However, they do not allow continuous monitoring of the motor heating process. Thermistors with their electronic circuit controls ensure complete protection against overheating caused by phase-fault, overload, under/ overvoltages or frequent reversals of the direction of rotation or on-off cycles. They have a low cost when compared to the Pt-100. However, they require a relay to control the alarm or operation activation.
Figure 7.4 - External view of a thermistor
Please find in the table below the main PTC types used for electric motors. The table shows the colors of the PTC cables with their respective activation temperature.
These thermostats are inserted into the winding heads of different phases and are series connected to the contactor
coil where, depending on the required protection and on the customer specifications, three thermostats ( one per phase ) or six thermostats ( two per phase ) can be used.
For alarm and tripping operation ( two per phase ), the alarm thermostats should be suitable for the activation at the high expected motor temperature, while the tripping thermostats should activate at the maximum temperature allowed for the insulation material.
Figure 7.5 - Internal and external view of a thermostat
The thermostats are also used for special applications of single-phase motors. In these applications, the thermostat can be series connected with the motor power supply, provided the motor current does not exceed maximum current allowed for the thermostat. If this occurs, the thermostat must be series-connected with the contactor coil. The thermostats are installed in the winding heads of different phases.

WEG also supplies electronic relay RPW that has the specific function to acquire the signal from the PTC and activates its output relay. For further information, please contact WEG.
7.2.3 Bimetal Thermal Protectors - Thermostats
These bimetal thermal protectors ( thermostat ) with NC silver contacts open when predetermined temperature rise is reached. When the activation temperature of the bimetal thermal protector decreases, the thermostat will return to its original form instantaneously allowing it to close the contacts again. The thermostats can be used on three-phase electric motors for alarm or tripping purposes or both ( alarm and tripping ).
Note: WEG recommends the installation of temperature sensors to protect the winding and bearings of the electric motor and so increase its useful life during operation.
Specification of Electric Motors 37

www.weg.net
7.2.4 Phenolic Thermal Protection System
These bimetal temperature sensors are fitted with NC contacts and are applied mainly for overheating protection of single-phase induction motors, caused by overloads, locked rotor conditions, voltage drops, etc.
The thermal protector is basically formed by one bimetallic disc that has two moving contacts, one resistance and one pair of fixed contacts. The thermal protector is series-connected with the power supply and, due to the thermal dissipation caused by the current flowing through its internal resistance, the disc
is submitted to a deformation that opens the contacts and the motor power supply is interrupted.
After the temperature drops below the specified one, the thermal protector will reset. Depending on the reset method, two types of thermal protectors may be used:
a ) Auto-reset thermal protector
b ) Manual reset thermal protector
Figure 7.7 - Internal view of the thermal protector
Thermal protectors can also be used for three-phase motors, but only when Y connected. The following connection diagram can be used:
Figure 7.8 - Thermal protector connection diagram for three-phase motors
Advantages
g Combination of a thermal protector sensitive to temperature and current;
g Possibility of automatic reset.
Disadvantages
g Current limitation, since the thermal protector is directly connected to the winding of the single-phase motor;
g Application on three-phase motors only when star- connected.
    Note: WEG recommends the installation of temperature sensors to protect the winding and bearings of the electric motor and so increase its useful life during operation.
    38 Specification of Electric Motors

   Table 7.5 - Thermal protection
g Usually these circuit-breakers do not have regulation/setting possibilities for their thermal current/rated overload, having only fixed values of this rated current and in most cases it is not equal to the rated current of the motor.
g In the case of three-phase systems, the thermal device of the circuit-breakers do not have the protection against “phase fault” as its thermal device does not have the “typical bipolar overload” - 2 phases - provided on the normal and the electronic overload relays.
7.3 Service Duty
According to IEC 60034-1, the service duty is the degree of regularity of load to which the motor is submitted. Standard motors are designed for continuous running duty. The load
is constant during an indefinite period of time, and it is equal
to the rated motor output. It is purchaser's responsibility to state the duty as accurately as possible. In cases where there are no load variations or when variations can be predicted,
the duty can be indicated by numbers or by means of charts representing the load variations over time. Whenever the actual load variation in real time cannot be determined a fictitious sequence, no less severe than the actual duty should be indicated by the customer. When another starting duty is used than the informed one on the motor nameplate this may result in motor overheating and consequent motor damage. In case of doubt, contact WEG.
7.3.1 Standardized Service Duties
According to IEC 60034-1, the duty types and the assigned alphanumeric symbols are explained below:

A duty consisting of a specific number of discrete values of loads (or equivalent loading) and if applicable, speed, each load/speed being maintained for sufficient time to allow the machine to reach thermal equilibrium, see Figures 7.18a, b, and c. The minimum load within a duty cycle may have the zero value (no-load or de-energized and at rest).

Note: with respect to duties S3 through to S8, the time of operation is generally too short to reach the thermal equilibrium. The motor heats up partially and cools down at every cycle. Only after many cycles, the motor reaches the thermal equilibrium.
k ) Special duties
The load can vary during operation time or when reversal or counter-current braking, etc. is activated. The proper motor selection can only be ensured after contacting the factory and providing a complete description of the cycle:
g Motor output required to drive the load. If the load varies cyclically, provide a load x time diagram (as example see Figure 7.15).
g Resistive torque of the load.
g Total moment of inertia ( GD2 or J ) of the driven
machine with reference to its rated speed.
g Number of starts, reversals, counter-current braking, etc. g Operation time with load and time at rest/no-load.
7.3.2 Duty Type Designation
The duty type shall be designated by the symbol described in item 7.3. The continuous running duty can be indicated alternatively by the word “continuous”. Examples for the duty type designation:
1 ) S2 60 seconds
The designation of the duties S2 to S8 is given by the following indications:
a ) S2, operation time at constant load;
b ) S3 to S6, cycle duration factor;
c ) S8, each one of the rated speeds that are part of the
cycle, followed by its respective rated output and its duration time.
For the duty types S4, S5, S7, and S8 other indications can be added to the designation, however, these indications should be agreed previously between the manufacturer and the customer.
Note: as an example of the indications to be added, previously agreed relating to the duty type designation different from the continuous running duty, following indications can be made relating to the considered duty type: a ) Number of starts per hour;
b ) Number of braking per hour;
c ) Type of braking;
d ) Constant of kinetic energy ( H ), rated speed of motor and load. The
last one can be changed by the inertia factor ( FI ).

Where: Δt is in p.u. ( per unit ) for the different loads and their respective operations. The TL value is given p.u. for the expected lifetime of the thermal insulation system. During the time at rest, the load must be indicated by the letter “r”.
7.3.3 Rated Output
Rated output is the mechanical power available at shaft end, within its characteristics at continuous running duty. The rated output concept, i. e., the mechanical power available
at shaft end, is directly related to the temperature rise of the winding. As you know, the motors can drive much higher power loads than its rated output, until it almost reaches the breakdown torque. However, if the overload exceeds motor output for which it has been designed, overheating will be generated and the motor lifetime will be reduced significantly, or may even result in motor burn out.
Consider that the required motor power is always defined by the load characteristics, for example: a load of 90 HP required from the motor, will be always 90 HP even if the motor has been designed for 75 HP or 100 HP.
7.3.4 Equivalent Power Ratings for Low Inertia Loads
It is assumed that the electric motor must supply to the driven machine the required power. It is also recommended that the motor provides some extra power for eventual overloads; depending on the duty cycle, the motor can occasionally supply more or less power. Although there
are many standardized ways to describe the running conditions of a motor, it is often necessary to evaluate the load conditions imposed on the motor by more complex duty cycles than those described in the standards. The formula below gives a usual method to calculate the equivalent power rating:
It is also based on the fact that load losses vary according
to the square of the load, and that the temperature rise is directly proportional to losses. This is true for motors that run continuously but drive intermittent loads.
So: Pm = Power
P12 . t1 + P22 . t2 + P32 . t3 + P42 . t4 + P52 . t5 + P62 . t6 t1 + t2 + t3 + t4 + t5 + t6
             21t2 Pm = T ∑ P ( t ) Δt
This method is based on the hypothesis that the effective load applied to the motor will provide the same thermal requirements than a fictitious equivalent load, that requires continuously the power Pm.
Time
Period
 Figure 7.19 - Continuous running with intermittent loads
If the motor is at rest between the operation times, the motor cooling will be reduced. Thus, for motors where the cooling efficiency is directly related to motor operation ( for example, TEFC motors ), the equivalent power is calculated by the following formula:

7.4 Service Factor ( SF )
Service factor ( SF ) is the factor that, when applied to rated output, represents the allowable load that can be applied to motor continuously, under specified operating conditions. Note that this refers to continuous overload conditions,
i.e., a power reserve that gives the motor a better capacity
to withstand adverse operating conditions. Service factor should not be confused with momentary overload capacity during a few minutes. A service factor = 1.0 means that the motor has not been designed for continuous operation above its rated output. However, this does not change its capacity to withstand instantaneous overloads. IEC 60034-1 specifies the most common Service Factors per motor output.
8. Environment Characteristics
The selection of electric motor for particular applications should consider some parameters such as:
g Altitude where the motor will be installed;
g Temperature of the cooling medium.
According to IEC 60034-1, the usual service conditions are: a ) Altitude not exceeding 1.000 masl;
b ) Cooling medium ( in most cases, the ambient air ) with
temperature not exceeding 40 oC and free from harmful substances.
Up to altitudes not exceeding 1.000 masl and ambient temperatures not exceeding 40 oC, the operating conditions are considered normal and the motor must supply its rated output without overheating.
8.1 Altitude
Motors operating at altitudes above 1000 m.a.s.l will have overheating problems caused by the rarefaction of the air which results in the reduction of the cooling capacity. Poor heat exchange between the motor and cooling air will require a loss reduction which will also reduce the motor output.
The motor heating is directly proportional to losses and these vary in quadratic proportion with the motor outputs.
There are some application alternatives to be evaluated:
a ) The installation of a motor at altitudes above 1000 masl can be made by using insulating material of higher thermal class;
b ) As per IEC 60034-1, temperature rise limits must be reduced by 1% for every 100 m of the altitude above 1000 masl. This rule is valid for altitudes up to 4.000 masl. For higher altitudes, please contact WEG.
Example:
A class B, 100 HP motor, Δt 80 K, operating at an altitude
of 1500 masl, the ambient temperature of 40 oC must be reduced by 5 oC, resulting in a maximum stable temperature of 36 oC. The ambient temperature may be evidently higher provided that temperature rise is lower than the temperature class of the insulating materials.
Tamb = 40 - 80 . 0.05 = 36 oC
8.2 Ambient Temperature
Motors operating at temperatures below 20oC will have the following problems:
a ) Excessive condensation, requiring additional condensed
water drains or installation of space heaters when motor remains out of service for long periods;
b ) Bearing frosting which causes grease or lubricant hardening requiring the use of special lubricants or antifreeze grease (please check our website).
Motors operating continuously at ambient temperatures above 40 oC, their insulation system can be damaged. A possible solution for this problem is to build the motor with a special design using special insulating materials or oversizing the motor.
8.3 Determining Useful Motor Output at Different Temperature and Altitude Conditions
Combining effects of temperature and altitude variation,
the dissipation capacity of motor output can be obtained multiplying the useful output by the multiplying factor of table 8.1 below:
Example:
A Class F Insulation motor, 100 HP, operating at an altitude of 2.000 masl and the ambient temperature of 55 oC. Based in table 8.1 - α = 0.83 thus P” = 0.83 , Pn
The motor can only supply 83% of its rated output.

8.4 Environment
8.4.1 Aggressive Environments
The aggressive environment such as shipyards, port facilities, fish industries, marine applications, chemical, and petrochemical industries require that all equipment operating at such environments are suitable and reliable to withstand such harsh conditions without presenting any problem.
For the application of electric motors in these aggressive environments, WEG has a specific line for each motor type duly designed to meet specific and standardized requirements for the most adverse operating conditions. These motors can be delivered with the following special characteristics:
g Double impregnated winding
g Anticorrosive alkyd paint (inside and outside)
g Galvanized mounting bolts
g Oil seal between the shaft and end shield (may be lip seal,
W3Seal, etc.)
g Additional protection by sealing joints.
For environments with a temperature range between -16oC and 40 oC and relative air humidity ≤ 95%, anticorrosive coating for internal surfaces is recommended. For environments with temperatures between 40 oC and
65 °C also anticorrosive coating for internal surfaces is
recommended, however, a derating factor to 40 oC should be
considered.
Note: for environments with relative air humidity &gt; 95%, anticorrosive coating for internal surfaces with connection of space heater is recommended.
For marine motors, the specific operating characteristics are defined by the type of driven load on board. However, all motors offer the following special features:
g Reduced temperature rise for operation in ambient up to 50 oC g Capacity to withstand without any problem, sudden
overload conditions of short duration up to 60% above the rated torque, as specified in standards of Certification Bodies.
WEG rigid control during the production process ensures reliable operation to the marine motors. They meet the construction and inspection requirements as well as the tests specified in the standards of the Certification Bodies, such as:
g Registro Italiano Navale (RINA)
g American Bureau of Shipping (ABS)
g Bureau Veritas (BV)
g China Certification Society (CCS)
g Det Norske Veritas and Germanischer Lloyd (DNV GL) g Lloyd's Register (LR)
g Russian Maritime Register of Shipping (RS)
g Korean Register of Shipping (KRS)
g Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (ClassNK)
8.4.2 Environments Containing Dust or Fibers
To analyze whether motors are suitable to operate in these environments, the following information should be available: approximate size and amount of fibers present in the environment. This information is since along the time, the fibers can obstruct the ventilation system resulting in motor overheating. If fiber content is excessive, air filters should be applied or the motor must be cleaned frequently.
Prevent motor cooling impairment
For this case there are two solutions:
1 ) Use motors without ventilation system;
2 ) For motor with cooling by ducts, calculate the volume of
air to be displaced by the motor fan, by establishing the airflow required for perfect the motor cooling.
8.4.3. Explosive Atmospheres
Explosion-proof, non-sparking, increased safety and dust- proof motors are intended for use in explosive atmospheres containing combustible gases, vapors, or explosive dust or fibers. Chapter 9 (explosive atmospheres) deals specifically with this subject.
8.5 Degree of Protection
Enclosures of electrical equipment, according to characteristics where they will be installed and their maintenance accessibility, should offer a certain degree of protection. Thus, for example, an equipment to be installed in a location subjected to water jets must have housing capable of withstanding the water jets under determined pressure and angle of incidence, without water penetration.
8.5.1 Identification Codes
Standard IEC 60034-5 defines the degrees of protection of electrical equipment by means of the characteristic letters IP, followed by two characteristic numerals.
Table 8.2 - The first characteristic numeral indicates the degree of protection against the ingress of solid objects and accidental or inadvertent contact.

www.weg.net
The combination of the two characteristic numerals, i. e., between The two degrees of protection are shown in Table 8.4. According to standards the qualification of a motor is clearly defined for each degree of protection by standardized tests that do not leave any scope of misinterpretation.
Bearing sealing
To meet the degree of protection required for each application, the motors have sealings that prevent the entry of waste through the bearings.
WEG Motors can be supplied with the following bearing sealing:
g V’Ring
g Lip seal / Oil seal
g Labyrinth
g WSeal® - Exclusive WEG's sealing system that consists of a
V'Ring with double lips and metal cap mounted on this ring. g W3 Seal® - Exclusive WEG's sealing system that consists of
three seals: V'Ring, O'Ring, and Labyrinth.
The WSeal® and W3 Seal® sealing systems have been developed by WEG to protect the motor against the accumulation of solid and liquid impurities present in the environment.
NOTE: To know the motor sealing, you should consult the seals available by product line and frame size.
The above options suit most applications on the market. For more information, contact WEG.
8.5.3 Weather Protected Motors
According to IEC 60034-5, the motor will be weather protected when due to its design (technical discussion between customer and WEG), the defined protections provide a correct operation of the motor against rain, dust and snow.
WEG also uses the letter W to indicate the degree of protection of the motor to indicate that the motor has
a special paint plan (weather protected). The painting plans may vary according to the environmental severity, which should be informed by the customer during motor specification/order.
Aggressive environments require that equipment be perfectly suitable to support such conditions ensuring high reliability in service without showing any problems.
WEG manufacturers a wide range of electric motors with special characteristics, suitable for use in shipyards, ports, fishing plants and several naval applications, as well as in chemical and petrochemical industries and other aggressive environments. So WEG motors are suitable to operate under the most severe operational conditions.

They are: IP21 and IP23 (to open motors), IP44 and IP55 (to enclosed motors). For special and more dangerous areas there are other commonly used degrees of protection such as IPW 55 (weather protection) IP56 (protection against water jets), IP65 (totally protected against dust) and IP66 (totally protected against dust and water jets).
46 Specification of Electric Motors

8.6 Space Heater
The space heater are installed inside the motor when it operates in high-humidity environments, (humidity&gt; 95%) and / or when it remains out of operation for long periods
(longer than 24 h), thus preventing water accumulation water inside the motor by the condensation of humid air.
The space heater heats up the motor inside few degrees above the ambient temperature (5-10 °C), when the motor is switched off. The supply voltage of the space heaters must be specified by customer. The space heaters can be supplied for following supply voltage: 110 V, 220 V and 440 V.
Depending on the frame size, following space heaters will be installed. See Table 8.5:
Table 8.5 - Space heaters
WARNING: the space heaters should only be powered on when motor is off, otherwise the motor may overheat, resulting in potential damages. Disconnect input power to the motor before performing any maintenance. Also space heaters must be disconnected from input power.
8.7 Noise Levels
WEG Motors comply with NEMA and IEC standards which specify the maximum sound pressure levels in decibels. The values of Table 8.6 comply with IEC 600034-9 standard.

9. Explosive Atmosphere
9.1 Hazardous Area
An installation where inflammable products are continually handled, processed or stored requires special care to ensure the maintenance of property and the personnel safety.
Based on their characteristics, electric equipment can become ignition sources causing sparks, when opening or closing contacts or due to overheating of any component, caused intentionally or originated by fault currents.
9.2 Explosive Atmosphere
An atmosphere is considered explosive when the proportion of gas, vapor, dust, fibers, or flyings is such that after sparking caused by short-circuit or overheating of one component causes an ignition and explosion. Three elements are required for an explosion to occur:
Fuel + oxygen + ignition = explosion
9.3 Classification of Hazardous Areas
According to IEC 60079-10-1 Standard, hazardous areas are classified as follows:
Zone 0:
Zone 20:
Area in which an explosive atmosphere in the form of a cloud of combustible dust in air is present continuously for long periods.
Zone 21:
Area in which an explosive atmosphere in the form of a cloud of combustible dust in air is likely to occur, occasionally, in normal operation.
Zone 22:
Area in which an explosive atmosphere in the form of a cloud of combustible dust in air is not likely to occur in normal operation but, if it does occur, will persist for a short period only.
Among the products where their powders or dusts create potentially explosive environments inside confined ambient are the coal, wheat, cellulose, fibers and plastics in finely divided particles, etc.
9.3.1. Classes and Groups of the Hazardous Areas
Classes - refer to the nature of the mixture. The concept of classes is only adopted by the NEC standard.
Groups - The definition of groups is associated with the composition of the mixture.
Class I
Explosive gases or steams. Based on the type of gas or steam, we have following classification:
g GROUP A - acetylene
g GROUP B - hydrogen, butadiene, ethane oxide
g GROUP C - ethyl ether, ethylene
g GROUP D - gasoline, naphtha, solvents in general.
Class II
Combustible of conductive dust. Based on the type dust, we have following classification:
g GROUP E
g GROUP F
g GROUP G Class III
Light and flammable fibers and particles.
According to IEC 60079-0, Hazardous areas are divided into three separate classifications:
g Group I - For mines containing methane gas.
g Group II - For application in other areas with gas explosive
atmospheres. These areas are dived in IIA, IIB and IIC.
g Group III - For application in explosive dust atmospheres.
These group is divided in:
g IIIA-Combustiblefibers
g III B - Non-conductive dust g IIIC-Conductivedust
Area where the occurrence of a flammable and/or explosive mixture is continuous, or exists for long periods. For example, inside a fuel tank the explosive atmosphere is always present.
Zone 1:
Area where the probability of occurrence of a flammable and/ or explosive mixture is associated with normal equipment and process' operation. The explosive atmosphere is frequently present.
Zone 2:
Area in which an explosive gas atmosphere is not likely to occur in normal operation, but if it does occur, will persist for a short period only. This conditions associated with abnormal operation of equipment and process, losses or negligent use. The explosive atmosphere may accidentally be present.
According to NEC/API 500 Standards, the hazardous areas are classified as follows:
g Division 1 - Area where there is HIGH probability of
occurring an explosion.
g Division 2 - Area where there is lower explosion probability.
Table 9.1 - Comparison between ABNT/IEC and NEC/API
The process of dust storage in confined spaces offers potentially explosive atmospheres. This occurs when dust is mixed with air in the form of a dust cloud or when the dust is deposited on the electrical equipment. Areas where dust, flyings and fibres in air occur in dangerous quantities are classified , according to IEC 61241-10, as hazardous and are divided into three zones according to the level of risk.

9.4 Temperature Classes
The maximum temperature on the outer and/or inner surface of an electric equipment must always be lower than the ignition temperature of the gas or steam. Gases can be classified for temperature classes based on their ignition temperature, where the maximum surface temperature of the corresponding class must be lower than the corresponding temperature of the gases.

 9.7 Explosion-Proof Equipment
It is a type of protection where the parts that may ignite an explosive atmosphere are confined within enclosures that can withstand the pressure caused by an internal explosion of an explosive atmosphere and prevents the transmission of the explosion to an explosive atmosphere.
Figure 9.3 - Protection principle
The induction motor (with any type of protection) is not tight protected, i. e., there is air exchange with the environment. During operation, the motor heats up and the inside air will have higher pressure than the outside (air is then blown out); when the power supply is turned off, motor cools down and, as a consequence, the inside pressure decreases allowing penetration of air (which is contaminated). The enclosure will not allow any eventual internal explosion to propagate to the external environment. For the system safety, WEG controls all air gaps - flame paths (tolerances between joints) and the finishing joint since they are responsible for the volume of gases exchanged between the inside and outside the motor.
10. Mounting Arrangements
10.1 Dimensions
Dimensions of WEG electric motors are standardized according to the standard International Electrotechnical Commission - IEC-60072. In these standards the basic dimension for the standardization of the assembly dimensions of electric machines is the height from the base to the shaft end center, designated by the letter H (see Figure 10.1).
The "A" dimension, distance between centerlines of mounting holes in the feet or base of machine, on the front side, is unique for H values up to 315, however it can have multiple values from frame size H equal to 35 mm. For those customers who require standardized frames size according to NEMA standard, table 10.1 makes a comparison between dimensions H-A-B-C-K-D- E of IEC standard and D; 2E; 2F; BA; H; U-N-W of NEMA standard.
Figure 10.1
To each height of shaft end H, a C dimension is associated, distance from the centerline of mounting hole in the nearest foot to the shoulder on drive end shaft. However, to each H dimension, several B dimension can be associated (distance between centerlines of mounting holes in feet), allowing to have either “longer” or “shorter” motors.

 For painting over the WEG original painting, please make sure with your paint supplier that the new painting
system is compatible with the base paint used in WEG motors and that the surfaces are prepared accordingly, otherwise it can affect the performance of the paint plan and void the product warranty.
10.4.1 Tropicalized Painting
High humidity indexes can result in premature insulation system deterioration which is the main component that ensures the motor lifetime. Any ambient with up to 95%
of relative humidity does not require additional protection, other than space heaters to avoid water condensation inside the motor. However, for any ambient with relative humidity above 95%, an epoxy painting is applied on all inside motor components which is known as tropic-proof painting.
11. Three-Phase Electric Motor Selection and Application
On application engineering of electric motors it is common to compare load requirements with motor characteristics. A lot of applications can be correctly driven by more than one type of motor.
This means that selection of a specific type of motor does not necessarily exclude other types.
Application of computers has improved significantly motor calculation resulting in more accurate results along with more economical designs of machines.
WEG induction motors, squirrel cage or slip rings, low or high voltage, can be used on a wide range of applications, specially in steel plants, mines, pulp and paper industries, sanitation, chemical and petrochemical areas, cement plants, among others, requiring more and more correct motor selection for each particular application. Proper motor selection with respect to the type, torque, power factor, efficiency, temperature rise, insulation system, voltage and mechanical degree of protection can only be made after careful overall analysis that takes into consideration certain parameters such as:
g Initial cost
g Power supply capacity
g Requirements for Power factor correction
g Required torques
g Effect of load inertia
g Speed control requirements or not
g Exposure of the machine to wet, polluted and/or aggressive
environments.
Squirrel cage asynchronous motor is the most commonly used in any industrial application due to its rugged and simple construction characteristics along with economic factors in reference to the motor itself, as control and protection.
Specification of Electric Motors 55

www.weg.net
Using WEG Premium line motors is regarded the most convenient current means to reduce energy consumption. It has been proved by tests that these motors have 30% less
of losses representing a major energy saving. Designed and manufactured with the state-of-the-art technology, these motors are intended to reduce losses and increase efficiency resulting in low energy consumption and reduced energy bills. These motors are also highly recommended for applications with voltage variation. They are tested in conformance with IEC 60034-1 Standard and their efficiency is indicated on the motor nameplate. The efficiency is determined by the test method B of the IEEE STD 112. Efficiency values are obtained through the loss separation method in accordance with IEC 60034-1.
The Premium line motors are standardized according to
IEC standards, maintaining the power/frame ratio and are therefore interchangeable with all standard motors available on the market. Although more expensive than the squirrel cage motors, the application of slip ring motors is necessary for starting heavy loads (high inertia), or when variable speed drives or starting current limitation is required while a high starting torque must be maintained.
b ) Acceleration torque
This torque is required to accelerate the load to the rated speed. At all points between zero and rated speed, the motor torque must always be higher than load torque. Right over the intersection point of the two curves, acceleration torque is zero, i.e., the balance point from which the speed remains constant is reached. This intersection point between the two curves should correspond to the rated speed.

  Table 11.1 - Comparison between different types of machines
For correct motor selection it is essential to consider all technical application characteristics, specially load, environment and power supply characteristics allowing the designer to calculate the following:
a ) Starting torque
The starting torque required to move and overcome the static inertia of the machine. For any load to be accelerated from zero speed to its rated speed, motor torque must be always higher than the load torque.
Figure 11.1 - Motor selection considering the resistive load torque
where: Cmáx = breakdown torque Cp = starting torque
Cr = resistive torque
ns = synchronous speed n = rated speed
The acceleration torque assumes very different values during the starting stage. The average acceleration torque ( Ca ) is obtained from the difference between motor torque and resistive load torque.
c ) Rated torque
It is the torque required to accelerate the load when operating at a specific speed. The torque required for normal operation of a machine can be constant or can vary between wide limits. For variable torques, the breakdown torque should be sufficiently high to withstand momentary overloads. The operating characteristics of a machine, related to torque, can be divided into three classes:
g Constant torque
On this type of machine, torque remains constant during speed variation and the output increases proportionally with the speed.
----------- Torque required by the machine --------- Outputrequiredbythemachine
Figure 11.2
C = Constant resistive torque
P = Power: proportional to the speed (n)
  56 Specification of Electric Motors

g Variable torque
Variable torque can be found in pumps and fans.
g Constant power
Constant Power applications require a power equal to the rated Power for any speed.
Figure 11.4
C = Resistive torque: inversely proportional to the speed P = Constant power

W22 Magnet Drive System® consists of a three-phase synchronous AC motor fitted with high energy magnets in their rotor and driven by a variable frequency drive (VFD)*.
The use of permanent magnets eliminates the Joule losses in the rotor thus ensuring higher efficiency levels than the IE4 efficiency level. As the Joule losses are eliminated, the motor operates colder enabling the use of smaller frame size and increases its lifetime.
The use of frequency inverter enables a continuous control of the motor speed and provides constant torque in the whole speed range, including 0 rpm, without requiring forced ventilation at low frequencies. Due to the rotor design, the used balancing process and the frame size reduction, the vibration and noise levels of W22 Magnet Motors could be reduced when compared to the induction motors with the same output.

*W22 Magnet motors must be driven only by the CFW-11 frequency inverter line developed with specific software for this function.
11.3 Application of Induction Motors with Variable Frequency Drives
Inverter fed induction motor drives (also called static frequency converters) are the most common solution used in the industry and is currently the most efficient method for the speed control of induction motors. These applications provide several benefits when compared to other speed control methods. However, these applications depend on a suitable design to take advantage when compared between energy efficiency and costs. Among the many benefits are the cost reduction, remote control, versatility, increased quality and productivity and better use of the energy performance.
11.3.1 Normative Aspects
The breakthrough occurred in the electric motor application with frequency inverters requires increasingly standards development and standards adoption to standardize the procedures for evaluating these drives.
The main International Standards that deal with this subject are:
g IEC: 60034-17 - Rotating Electrical Machines - Part 17: Cage induction motors when fed from converters - application guide
g IEC 60034-25 - Rotating Electrical Machines - Part 25: Guide for the design and performance of cage induction motors specifically designed for converter supply
g NEMA MG1 - Application considerations for constant speed motors used on a sinusoidal bus with harmonic content and general purpose motors used with adjustable- voltage or adjustable-frequency controls or both
g NEMS MG1 - Part 31: Definite purpose inverter-fed polyphase motor
11.3.2 Induction Machine Speed Variation by Frequency Inverter
The relationship between the rotor speed, the supply frequency, the number of poles and the slip of an induction motor is given by the following equation: number of poles and the slip of an induction motor is given by the following equation:
120 . f1 . ( 1 - s )
n = --------------------------
p
where: n = mechanical speed [rpm] f = line frequency [Hz]
p = number of poles s = slip
The analysis of the formula shows that the best way to vary the speed of an induction motor is by varying the supply frequency. The frequency inverters transform the line voltage, with constant amplitude and frequency, into a voltage with variable amplitude and frequency. The speed of the rotating field and consequently the mechanical speed of the motor is changed by varying the frequency of the supply voltage. Thus, the inverter operates as a source of variable frequency to
the motor. According to the induction motor theory, the electromagnetic torque developed by the motor is given by the following equation:
T = K .Φ . I 1 m 2
When the voltage drop is neglected due to the impedance of the stator winding, the magnetization flux will be:
V1
Φm = K2 .

where: T Φm

: rotor current (A) (depends on the load) : rotor voltage (V)

V1
k1 and k2: constants (depend on the material and on the machine
design)

However, to operate the motor in a speed range it is not sufficient to change only the supply frequency. Also, the voltage amplitude must be proportionally changed to the frequency variation. Thus, the current flux and consequently the electromagnetic torque of the motor remain constant, while the slip is maintained. The change of the V/f variation rate is linear up to the base frequency (rated) of motor operation. Above this value, the voltage, that is equal to the rated motor voltage, remains constant and only the stator frequency is changed.

11.3.3 Characteristics of the Frequency Inverter
In order to obtain an output signal of desired voltage and frequency, the input signal must accomplish three stages within the frequency inverter:
g Diode bridge - Rectification (converting AC to DC) -
voltage coming from the power supply;
g Filter or DC Link - Regulation/smoothing of the rectified
signal with storage in a capacitor bank;
g IGBT power transistors - Inversion (converting AC to DC) of
the DC link voltage by the Pulse-Width Modulation
(PWM) technique. This modulation technique allows the output voltage/frequency variation by means of transistors (electronic switches) without interfering with the
 Thus, the region above the base frequency is referred to as field weakening, in which the flux decreases causing the motor torque decrease. The torque supplied by the motor remains constant up the base frequency of the operation, decreasing gradually when operating frequencies are increased.

11.3.3.1 Control Types
Variable voltage and frequency
 Field Weakening
  fb Frequency
There are basically two electronic inverter control types: scalar and vector.
The scalar control is based on the original concept of a frequency inverter: a signal of certain voltage/frequency ratio is imposed onto the motor terminals and this ratio is kept constant throughout a frequency range, in order to keep the magnetizing flux of the motor practically unchanged. It is generally applied when there is no need of fast responses to torque and speed commands and is particularly interesting when there are multiple motors connected to a single
drive. The control is by open loop and the obtained speed precision is a function of the motor slip, which depends on the motor load. To improve the performance of the motor at low speeds, some drives use special functions such as slip compensation (attenuation of the speed variation as function of the load) and voltage boost (increase of the V/f ratio to compensate for the voltage drop due to the stator resistance and maintain the torque capacity of the motor) at low speeds.
 
www.weg.net
This is the most used control type owing to its simplicity and also due to the fact that the majority of applications do not require high precision or fast responses during the speed control.
The vector control enables fast responses and high precision levels on the motor speed and torque control. Essentially the motor current is decoupled into two vectors: one to produce the magnetizing flux and the other to produce the torque, each one regulating the torque and the flux separately. The vector control can be realized by open loop (sensorless) or closed loop (feedback) control.
g Speed feedback - a speed sensor (for instance, an incremental encoder) is required on the motor. This control mode provides great accuracy on both torque and speed of the motor even at very low (and zero) speeds.
g Sensorless control is simpler than the closed loop control, but its action is limited particularly to very low speeds. At higher speeds this control mode is practically as good as the feedback vector control.
11.3.3.2 Harmonics
For the AC power line, the system (frequency inverter + motor) is a non-linear load which current include harmonics. The characteristic harmonics generally produced by the rectifier are considered to be of order h = np±1 on the AC side, thus, in the case of a 6 diode (6 pulses) bridge, the most pronounced generated harmonics are the 5th and the 7th ones, which magnitudes may vary from 10% to 40% of the fundamental component, depending on the power line impedance. In the case of rectifier bridges of 12 pulses (12 diodes), the most harmful harmonics generated are the 11th and the 13th ones. The higher the order of the harmonic, the lower can be considered its magnitude.
So higher order harmonics can be filtered more easily.
The most commercially available drives have 6-pulses.
The harmonic distortion of the power system can be quantified by the THD (Total Harmonic Distortion), which is informed by the inverter manufacturer and is defined as:
h √∞A2
where: Ah : are the rms values of the non-fundamental harmonic components A1 : is the rms value of the fundamental component
h : harmonic order
The IEEE Std.512 recommends maximum values for
current harmonics generated by electric equipment. Most manufacturers of inverters take care during the design of their equipment to ensure that the THD limits established by this standard are fulfilled.

11.3.4 Inverter Influencing Motor Performance
Induction motors driven by PWM inverter are subjected to harmonics that can increase the losses and the temperature as well as the noise and vibration levels, when compared
to the sinusoidal supply condition. The inverter influence on the motor depends on several factors related to the control, such as switching frequency, the effective pulse width, pulse number, among others.

There are basically the following solutions to mitigate the harmonics generated by a PWM frequency inverter:
Installation of output filters (load reactance, dV/dt filters, sinusoidal filters, etc.), use of multi-level inverters (more sophisticated topology), Pulse Width Modulation quality improvement (optimization of pulse patterns) and increase of the switching frequency.
Furthermore, other effects may appear when induction motors are fed by inverters. Although not produced specifically by the harmonics, other important effects may appear and should not be neglected, such as dielectric stress of the insulation system and shaft currents that reduce bearing life.

Considerations regarding energy efficiency
The lack of international standards that specify test procedures to evaluate the system (motor + inverter) efficiency allows such tests to be carried out in many different ways. Therefore, the results obtained should not influence the acceptance (or not) of the motor, except under mutual accordance between customer and manufacturer, as specified by international standards. Experience shows the effectiveness of the considerations below:
g An induction motor fed by PWM voltage provides a lower efficiency level than when fed by purely sinusoidal voltage, due to the losses increase caused by harmonics.
g In applications of motors with frequency inverters, the whole system must be evaluated (inverter + motor), rather than the motor efficiency only.
g Each case must be properly analyzed, taking into account following characteristics: operating frequency, switching frequency, load conditions, motor power, THD supplied by the inverter, etc.
g Special measuring instruments must be used for the correct evaluation of electrical quantities (True RMS meters).
g Higher switching frequencies increase the motor efficiency and decrease the inverter efficiency.
Influence of the inverter on the temperature rise of the winding
Induction motors may heat up more when fed by frequency inverter than when fed by sinusoidal voltage supply. This higher temperature rise results from the motor losses' growth owing
to the high harmonic components of the PWM signal and the often reduced heat transfer resulting from speed variation of self- ventilated motors operating at low frequencies. Basically there are following solutions to prevent motor overheating:
g Rated torque derating (frame oversize);
g Use of independent cooling system;
g Utilization of the “Optimal Flux Solution” (exclusive to
applications using WEG drives and motors).
Criteria for torque derating
In order to keep the temperature rise of WEG motors, when supplied by PWM, within acceptable levels and the loadability, limits shown in Fig. 11.13 and 11.14 must be met.
Note: Motors rated for explosive atmospheres should be evaluated on a case by case basis - in such case please contact WEG.
Optimal flux condition
The “Optimal Flux” solution was developed for the purpose of making WEG induction motors able to operate at low speeds with constant torque loads still keeping an acceptable temperature rise level, without the need of neither oversizing the machine nor blower cooling it.
The study of the composition of the motor losses and their relation with the frequency, magnetic flux, current and the speed variation allowed the determination of an optimal flux condition for each speed.
The incorporation of the solution obtained for WEG CFW700 / CFW701 and CFW11 inverters allows a continuous mitigation of the motor losses throughout the whole operating range, which is performed automatically by the inverter.
Important!
This solution can only be used for variable torque loads or when applied above the base frequency and when:
g Class IE2 High-Efficiency or Class IE3 Premium Efficiency
motors are used;
g The motor is fed by WEG frequency inverter
( CFW11 or CFW700 / CFW701 version 2.40 or above ); g Sensorless vector control is used.

Modern frequency inverters use power transistors (typically IGBTs), whose switching process occurs at very high speed - at kHz frequencies. To achieve such switching, the transistors have very fast times for conducting initiation and blocking which result in voltage pulses with a high dV/dt (rate of voltage change over time). When squirrel cage induction motors are fed by frequency, those pulses combined with the cable
and motor impedance may cause repetitive overvoltages (overshoots) at the motor terminals. This pulse train may degrade the motor insulation system and may hence reduce the motor lifetime. The overshoots affect especially the inter turn isolation of random winding and its value is determined primarily by following factors: rise time of the voltage pulse, cable length and type, minimum time between pulses, switching frequency and multi motor operation.

Criteria regarding the insulation system
When WEG low voltage induction motors are used with frequency inverters, the following criteria must be met to protect the insulation system of the motor: if any of the conditions below are not met, filters must be installed between the frequency inverter and the motor.
Note: motors rated for explosive atmospheres should be evaluated on a case by case basis - in such case please contact WEG.
Table 11.4
* Definition in accordance with NEMA MG1- Part 30
The phenomenon of induced shaft voltage/current is caused fundamentally due to unbalanced waveforms present in
the magnetic circuit of the motor. The usual causes of this problem that primarily affect large machines are eccentricities and other imperfection resulting from the manufacturing process. The advent of PWM inverters aggravated this problem, now occurring also with lower power machines, since the motors are now fed with unbalanced waveforms that have high frequency components. The causes of shaft induced voltage owing to the PWM inverters supply is added to those intrinsic voltages of the motor which also causes current circulation through the bearings.
The basic reason for bearing currents to occur within a PWM inverter fed motor is due to the common mode voltage. The high frequency of the common mode voltage generated by the frequency inverter ensures that the capacitive reactances within the motor become low, allowing the current to pass through the coupling formed by the rotor, shaft and bearing toward the earth.
Common mode voltage and motor equivalent circuit
for high frequencies
The three-phase voltages supplied by the PWM inverter, different from the pure sinusoidal voltage, is not balanced, i.e., the vector sum of the instantaneous voltages at the three phases of the frequency inverter output is not equal to zero, but it is equal to an electric potential of high frequency.
This high frequency common mode voltage may result
in undesirable common mode currents. Existing stray capacitances between motor and earth may allow current flowing to the earth, passing through rotor, shaft and bearings and reaching the end shield (earthed).
The high frequency model of the motor equivalent circuit, in which the bearings are represented by capacitances shows the paths through which the common mode currents flow. At high speed operation there is no contact between the rotor and the (earthed) outer bearing raceway, due to the plain distribution of the grease.
The electric potential of the rotor may then increase with respect to the earth until the dielectric strength of the grease film is disrupted, occurring voltage sparking and flow of discharge current through the bearings. This current that circulates whenever the grease film is momentarily broken down is often referred to as the “capacitive discharge component”.
These discontinuous electric discharges wear the raceways and erode the rolling elements of the bearings, causing small superimposing punctures. Long term flowing discharge currents result in furrows (fluting), which reduce bearings life and may cause the premature machine failure.
There is still another current component that circulates permanently through the characteristic conducting loop comprising the shaft, bearings, end shields and the housing/ frame, that is often called the conduction component.

Protection criteria against bearing currents

Note: motors rated for explosive atmospheres should be evaluated on a case by case basis - in such case please contact WEG.
12. Environmental Information
12.1 Packaging
WEG electric motors are supplied in cardboard, plastic, steel or wooden packaging. These materials can be recycled or reused. All wood used in the packaging of WEG motors comes from reforestation.
12.2 Product
As far as constructive aspects are concerned, electric motors are basically manufactured with ferrous metals
(steel, cast iron), non-ferrous metals (copper, aluminum),
and plastic. In general, the electric motor has long life cycle, however, when its disposal, WEG recommends that the packaging and the product materials are properly separated and sent for recycling. Non-recyclable materials should be properly disposed in landfills, co-processed or incinerated. Service providers of recycling, disposal, co-processing or incineration must be properly licensed by local environmental authorities to carry out these activities.
13. Tests
This chapter defines the witnessed or no witnessed tests that can be performed by WEG upon customer request.
As defined by IEC 60034-1, the tests are grouped in ROUTINE, TYPE and SPECIAL tests. The test procedures are specified in IEC 60034-2. Other tests not listed below can be performed by the manufacturer provided there is an agreement between the parties.

  Table 11.5 - Bearing protection
The rotating electrical machines have basically three
noise sources: the ventilation system, the rolling bearings and the electromagnetic excitation. Bearings in perfect operating conditions produce practically despicable noise, in comparison with other sources of the noise generated by the motor.
In motor fed by sinusoidal supply, especially those with reduced number of poles (higher speeds), the main noise source is the ventilation system. On the other hand, in motors with higher number of poles and lower operation speeds often stands out the electromagnetic noise.
However, in variable speed drive systems, especially at low operating speeds when ventilation is reduced, the electromagnetically excited noise can be the main source of noise whatever the motor polarity, owing to the harmonic content of the voltage.
Criteria regarding the noise level
Results of laboratory tests (4 point measurements accom- plished in semi-anechoic chamber with the
frequency inverter installed outside the chamber) carried
out with several WEG motors and frequency inverters using different switching frequencies have shown that WEG three-phase induction motors, when fed by PWM frequency inverters and operating at rated frequency (typically 50 or 60 Hz) present an increment in the sound pressure level of 11 dB(A) at most.
Notes:
g O switching frequency increase tends to reduce the noise level of
electromagnetic origin generated by the motor.
g The noise criteria above apply only to motor frame sizes ≤ 355.

            <Text>Bore and stroke are terms used to define the size of an engine. Bore refers to the diameter of the engine's cylinder, and stroke refers to the distance the piston travels from the top of the cylinder to the bottom. The highest point of travel by the piston is called top dead center (TDC), and the lowest point of travel is called bottom dead center (BDC). One stroke is 180° of travel up or down between TDC and BDC.

            <Title>Head Calculations</Title>
            <Text>Fresh water has a specific weight  &lt;me&gt; \gamma_{\scriptsize{\ce{H2O}}} = 62.4 \lb{}/\ft{}^3&lt;/me&gt;.  This means that a \ft{1}\times\ft{1}\times\ft{1} cube of water weighs \lb{62.4}.  To find the pressure of a column of water 1 foot high, divide the weight of the water by the by the area of the of the base of the cube. &lt;me&gt; \textrm{1 foot of head}  = \frac{\lb{62.4}}{\inch{144}^2} = \psi{0.433}&lt;/me&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;One cubic foot of fresh water weighs 62.4 pounds.&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/water-cube.jpeg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
This equation indicates that a 1 foot head of fresh water exerts a \psi{ 0.433} pressure at the base. 
Each additional foot of head will increase the pressure by an additional \psi{0.433}, so a head h (of water, in feet) is equivalent to a pressure &lt;me&gt;p = \left[\frac{\psi{0.433}}{\ft{1}}\right] h&lt;/me&gt;
For liquids other than fresh water, the calculation must be adjusted for density.  Recall that the specific gravity of a substance is defined as the ratio of the density (or specific weight) of a substance to the same value for water &lt;me&gt;\textrm{s.g.} = \frac{\rho}{\rho_{\scriptsize{\ce{H2O}}}} = \frac{\gamma}{\gamma_{\scriptsize{\ce{H2O}}}}&lt;/me&gt;.  Fresh water has a specific gravity of 1; salt water has a specific gravity of 1.031, so it is slightly denser than fresh water; and mercury has a specific gravity of 13.633, so it is much denser than water.
To find the pressure in psi of a head h of a fluid with a specific gravity s.g. &lt;men xml:id='head-equation'&gt; p =  \left[\frac{\psi{0.433}}{\ft{1}}\right ] (\textrm{s.g.})\  h&lt;/men&gt;

            <Title>Centrifugal Pump Design</Title>
            <Text>Centrifugal pumps come in two basic designs, volute and diffuser, and many variations, including: single- or double-suction, single or multiple stages, and horizontal or vertical layout. 
In the  volute pump, the one most commonly used, the impeller discharges into a progressively expanding casing, as shown in &lt;xref ref="centpump_png"/&gt;. The casing is proportioned to produce equal velocity of flow all around the circumference of the casing and then gradually to reduce the velocity as the liquid passes from the casing into the nozzle to be discharged from the pump, thereby transforming a considerable part of the velocity head into pressure head. 
&lt;figure xml:id="diffusertype_png"&gt;
 &lt;caption&gt;Diffuser Type Centrifugal Pump&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;image source="images/diffusertype.png" width="50%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
In the  diffuser pump, the impeller is surrounded by gradually expanding passages formed by stationary guide vanes, sometimes called a diffusion ring, as shown in &lt;xref ref="diffusertype_png"/&gt;. In these expanding passages the direction of flow is changed and velocity largely converted to pressure before the liquid enters the volute. It is worth noting that the diffuser vanes are set approximately tangent to the ends of the impeller blades. In this kind of casing, efficiency may be slightly higher than in volute pumps, since velocity is more completely converted into pressure. The added cost of manufacture and more complicated construction of diffuser pumps, however, is generally not considered justified except occasionally in the case of large high pressure pumps. 
&lt;figure xml:id="impellers_png"&gt;
 &lt;caption&gt;Impellers&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;image source="images/impellers.png" width="50%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
The impellers used in volute and diffuser pumps are of three kinds, &lt;em&gt;open&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;semi-open&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;enclosed&lt;/em&gt; as shown in &lt;xref ref="impellers_png"/&gt;. The open impeller consists only of blades attached to a hub. The semi-open impeller is constructed with a circular plate, called the web, on the inside edge of the blades. The web need not extend all the way out to the ends of the blades. The use of a web makes it possible to use thinner blades. In the case of the enclosed impeller, a shroud is added on the outside edge of the blades, so that the liquid is in large measure confined in the blade region, between the web and the shroud. Holding the liquid between these plates reduces friction losses in the pump. Open and semi-open impellers are normally found in pumps that must handle relatively large solids in the liquid, such as sewage pumps. 
Impellers may also be  single or  double-suction. The former consists of a single impeller drawing liquid in from one side through one eye, while the double suction impeller is similar to a pair of single suction impellers placed back to back, placing an eye on each side of the impeller so that the liquid is drawn into the impeller from opposite directions. Double suction impellers can handle greater capacities of liquid than a single suction impeller of the same size and operating speed. This is because the larger inlet area of the two suction eyes provides less resistance to liquid flow into the impeller. 
&lt;figure xml:id="doublesuction_png"&gt;
 &lt;caption&gt;Double Suction Pump&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;image source="images/doublesuction.png" width="50%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
 Single stage pumps contain only one impeller, drawing in the liquid and expelling it through the discharge into the liquid system. A double-suction, single-stage pump is shown in &lt;xref ref="doublesuction_png"/&gt;. A disadvantage of the single-stage pump, however, is that discharge pressure cannot be increased above the maximum working pressure of the impeller design operating at a given speed. Above this limit, under practical working conditions, the pump will not deliver any further increase in pressure. Most volute type, single stage pumps do not operate at speeds in excess of 3600 RPM and typically produce maximum discharge pressures in the 150 to 200 psi range. Diffuser type, single stage pumps may operate at speeds as high as 8000 RPM and produce discharge pressures in excess of 1000 psi; turbine driven boiler feed pumps are sometimes this type. 
In  multistage pumps, this disadvantage is overcome by combining several single-stage pumps, whether single or double suction, so that the discharge of one impeller is delivered to the suction of the next impeller. The liquid is delivered to each succeeding stage under the pressure imparted to it by the preceding stage, and additional velocity and pressure are added. As the liquid passes through each impeller in turn, additional pressure is imparted to it. A much higher working head can be produced than is possible with a single impeller. For the sake of compactness the several impellers of multistage pumps are almost invariably placed on one shaft, and the whole unit is built into one housing. The impellers are arranged in multistage pumps to eliminate or minimize end thrust. 
Both volute and diffuser pumps will be found in single and multi-stage construction. Because of the greater cost and complexity of diffuser pumps, they are rarely used. 
The pump itself can have a &lt;em&gt;vertical&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;horizontal&lt;/em&gt; layout, determined by the direction of the pump shaft axis when the pump is installed. Horizontal designs, in most applications, are easier for maintenance personnel to work on, while vertical designs require less floor space for installation. Both designs work equally well. </Text>

            <Title>Superheater</Title>
            <Text>When water boils, it occurs at a particular temperature which is determined by the pressure of the surroundings. For example, water at atmospheric pressure always boils at 212 °F, while water at 600 psia always boils at 486 °F. This boiling temperature is known as the &lt;em&gt;saturation temperature&lt;/em&gt; and it can easily be determined from the steam tables found in . At a given pressure, the steam’s temperature can be raised above the corresponding saturation temperature by adding additional heat to the steam, but this must occur in an area where there is no liquid water present, or the additional heat would simply boil more water and would not raise the steam temperature at all. Raising steam temperature above the saturation temperature is known as &lt;em&gt;superheating&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;degree of superheat&lt;/em&gt; refers to the difference between the steam temperature and the saturation temperature corresponding to the steam’s pressure. For example, 600 psia, 600 °F steam would have 114 degrees of superheat, since it is 114 degrees above the corresponding saturation temperature. 
In marine boilers, superheating occurs in the &lt;em&gt;superheater&lt;/em&gt;. The superheater is a series of boiler tubes located in the hottest part of the gas path, but screened from the radiant heat of the furnace behind three or more rows of &lt;em&gt;screen tubes&lt;/em&gt;. Heat is added to the superheater primarily by convection. The superheater tubes and headers may be installed either horizontally or vertically. 
All the steam formed in the generating tubes rises up to the steam drum and flows into the dry pipe, and from there the steam, which is dry and at saturation temperature, enters the superheater header and is distributed to the superheater tubes. There, the steam picks up sensible heat, which increases the energy content of the steam, improving the overall steam cycle efficiency and reducing fuel consumption. The steam leaves the boiler at the superheater outlet. At the outlet you will find a &lt;em&gt;superheater vent&lt;/em&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;superheater safety valve&lt;/em&gt; followed by the main and turbogenerator steam stop valves. 
The degree of superheat created in the superheater is determined by several factors, including the temperature of the feedwater, the load on the boiler, and the number and location of burners in use. These factors are not adjustable by the engineer, so the superheater outlet temperature is not under his direct control. A boiler of this type is known as an&lt;em&gt;uncontrolled superheat&lt;/em&gt; boiler. Other boiler designs provide a means to control the superheat temperature independent of the above factors, and are known as &lt;em&gt;controlled superheat&lt;/em&gt; boilers. 
The superheater elements are normally filled entirely with steam, not water. Since no boiling occurs there, all the heat transferred to the superheater tubes must be carried away by the steam flowing through the tubes, or else they will quickly overheat and burn out, destroying the boiler. Whenever there is a fire in the boiler and no steam flow leaving the boiler, the superheater vent must be opened manually by the engineer to protect the superheater from overheating.

            <Title>Boiler explosion</Title>
            <Text>A boiler explosion is a catastrophic destruction of the boiler caused by a rapid, uncontrolled combustion of fuel inside the furnace.  Boiler explosions occur when an *explosive mixture* of unburned fuel and oxygen in the furnace is ignited by an ignition source such as hot brickwork or an inserted torch.  The unburned fuel must be in vapor form to cause an explosion.  It may may be supplied by an unignited burner, or by evaporation of liquid fuel in contact with hot boiler surfaces. The oxygen is readily available through open register doors and from the forced draft fan. In order to be explosive however, the air/fuel ratio must fall within a certain range -- too much air, or too little, and the mixture will not be explosive, but with the right ratio and an ignition trigger...

A *flareback* is small boiler explosion, which usually occurs during light-off. It extinguishes the atomizer fires and causes furnace gas and flame to blow into the fireroom through the burner peep hole an light-off port. While not as destructive as a boiler explosion, flarebacks can injure personnel and are a sign that something is wrong with your light off procedures -- insufficient purge, registers not opened, oil too hot or too cold, improperly assembled tips, etc. When lighting off, always wear a face shield and keep your face away from the peephole, just in case.  

Boiler explosions occur most frequently during light-off, and the most common cause  is attempting to light or re-light a burner without a proper purge. The furnace must *always* be purged to remove or lower the concentration of explosive vapors before lighting off.  A five minute purge with the forced draft fan on high and the register doors wide open is sufficient to completely replace all air in the furnace.   Light off with a torch or an igniter; never attempt to light off by using the hot brickwork. Once the burner is lit, the air register must be opened wide immediately to supply enough air for good combustion.  If the boiler does not light of on the first try, review the light-off procedure before proceeding.  Repeated unsuccessful light-off attempts are a danger sign. 

Another dangerous condition occurs when liquid oil accumulates in the furnace. The hot surfaces in the furnace vaporize the oil and, with the right amount of oxygen, create potentially explosive situation.  This situation can occur after a loss of fires.  Normally this will be detected by the flame scanner and the fuel oil solenoid will secure the fuel supply. If this system fails, unburned fuel will spray into the furnace until the fuel is secured manually. Other possibilities include improperly assembled or damaged atomizers, that drip oil rather than creating a well formed spray pattern, and leaking or incompletely closed burner valves on secured burners. This situation will probably be accompanied by heavy black smoke that can not be cleared by adjusting the air flow. 

Purging is not sufficient when oil pools in a boiler. Any amount of unburned fuel pooled in the furnace should be considered dangerous. The boiler must be shut down and the accumulated oil removed by hand after the boiler has cooled.  </Text>

            <Title>Direct-current generators</Title>
            <Text>Since any generator with a rotating element will naturally produce an alternating voltage, it is necessary, in a DC generator, to continually convert this alternating voltage into a direct voltage. In traditional DC generators the construction of the machine is reversed relative to the alternators discussed above, so that the magnetic field is stationary, while the windings rotate, as in &lt;xref ref="fig_24_13_png"/&gt;. The rotor is then called the   &lt;term&gt;armature&lt;/term&gt;, and is fitted with a rotating switching device called a   &lt;term&gt;commutator&lt;/term&gt;, which does the AC to DC conversion. The voltage produced in the windings of the armature is sinusoidal, as it is in an alternator. If this voltage were taken out of the rotor by slip rings and brushes, as in &lt;xref ref="fig_24_12_png"/&gt;, single-phase AC would be delivered to the generator terminals. The commutator is essentially a single slip ring divided into separate segments called &lt;term&gt;commutator bars&lt;/term&gt;. Each terminal of the armature winding is connected to one commutator bar. As the armature rotates, the winding terminal beneath each brush switches half way through every revolution, simultaneously with the change in polarity of the voltage in the winding. The polarity of one brush and its connected generator terminal is thus always positive, while the other brush and generator terminal is always negative.
&lt;figure xml:id="fig_24_13_png"&gt;
 &lt;caption&gt;Two-pole DC generator with commutator&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;image source="pics/electricity/24-13.png" width="75%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
The DC voltage produced by a generator with a single armature winding and a two-bar commutator fluctuates as shown in the upper plot of &lt;xref ref="fig_24_14_png"/&gt;. To obtain a more constant voltage more windings would be added to the armature, with each winding connected to a pair of diametrically-opposed commutator bars, to yield an output voltage curve as shown in the lower plot of &lt;xref ref="fig_24_14_png"/&gt;. The more windings there are on the armature, the steadier will be the resulting terminal voltage of the generator. Large DC generators have dozens of armature windings and commutator bars.
&lt;figure xml:id="fig_24_14_png"&gt;
 &lt;caption&gt;Voltage delivered by a DC generator with, at top, a single winding and a   two-segment commutator, and, at bottom, three evenly-spaced windings and as six-bar   commutator.&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;image source="pics/electricity/24-14.png" width="60%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
A commutator is only one way to achieve the continual switching necessary to convert AC to DC; electronic devices called &lt;term&gt;rectifiers&lt;/term&gt; are also used. Modern rectifiers are built around solid-state &lt;term&gt;diodes&lt;/term&gt;. A diode has low resistance to current flow in one direction and very high resistance to current flow in the other direction. &lt;xref ref="fig_24_15_png"/&gt; depicts a rectifier circuit. By appropriately connecting rectifiers to the stator windings of an alternator, DC can be provided without the maintenance problems associated with brushes and commutators. Alternators can be used in automobiles, where the power is distributed as DC, because they are fitted with rectifiers.

 &lt;image source="pics/boilers/safetyvalve.png" width="75%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
The boiler is equipped with three safety valves, similar to the one shown in &lt;xref ref="register_png"/&gt; Two are located on the steam drum, and one on the superheater outlet pipe. The safety valve outlets are connected to the &lt;em&gt;sky pipe&lt;/em&gt; which discharges outside the engine room up the smokestack. The safety valves are set to open if the boiler pressure becomes too high. The superheater safety valve is adjusted to the lowest opening pressure, so it will open first, followed by the two drum safeties. It is important that the superheater safety valve opens first, because if the drum safety valve opened first, there would be a disruption of the flow of steam through the superheater, which would cause it to overheat.

            <Title>International System of Units (SI)/Metric (kPa)</Title>
            <Text>In the metric system, pressure is typically measured using kilopascals (kPa), which represent newtons per square meter (N/m²). One pascal is equal to one newton of force distributed over a one-square-meter area. However, this is a relatively small pressure, so in practical applications, kilopascals (kPa) or megapascals (MPa) are commonly used. 
One newton is the force needed to accelerate one kilogram of mass at the rate of one meter per second squared. So, we can say one newton is one kgm/s². 
Force Units are measured in pascals or kilopascals (newtons). 
Area Units are measured in centimeters or meters squared. 
In the SI system, pressure is described in pascals (Pa). Since Pressure = Force/Area, the equation for measuring pressure in pascals is: 
Pressure (pascals) = \frac{Force}{Area} =\frac{Newtons}{MetersSquared} =\frac{N}{m^{2}} = \frac{kg}{mxs^{2}}

Pressure = \frac{Force}{Area}
   \frac{Newtons}{Meterssquared}= \frac{F = ma}{MetersSquared} = \frac{kgxM/s^{2}}{MetersSquared}=\frac{Forceduetogravity = 9.8m/s^{2}}{Area}</Text>

            <Title>Leaking boiler tubes</Title>
            <Text>Boiler leaks range from small to large, and may come on slowly or suddenly.  Your response will depend on the severity of the casualty.

A leaking boiler can be detected in a number of ways.  With small leaks, your first indication may come from unusual behavior of the boiler water chemistry.  A small leak is like putting the boiler on continuous blowdown.  You will observe a reduction in boiler chemical concentrations -- total dissolved solids, phosphates and salinity will all decrease. With larger leaks, you may notice steam in the periscope, or see wisps of steam escaping from the stack. You may see water or steam escaping from the boiler, or hear an unusual hissing noise. Leaking boilers will require more feedwater than normal -- the feed regulator will open wider, and you will use more make up feed.  Leaks cause additional fuel to be burned resulting in an increased fuel oil pressure at the manifold. With major leaks you may find it impossible to maintain the boiler water level and boiler pressure, and they might even extinguish the fires.

Boiler leaks are generally caused by improper operation or maintenance</Text>

            <Title>Transformers</Title>
            <Text>A transformer is an electrical device that uses electromagnetic induction to increase (step-up) or decrease (step-down) AC voltages.  Transformers are simple, efficient, have no moving parts, are easily maintained.
A simple single-phase transformer consists of two wire coils, called the primary and secondary windings, wound around a common magnetic core.  The core is made of laminated soft iron sheets or other materials that have high magnetic permeability, to enhance the magnetic coupling between the windings. An AC source voltage is supplied to the primary winding, and the electrical load is connected to the secondary winding. 
&lt;figure xml:id="fig_transformer_terms"&gt;

&lt;caption&gt;  Transformer terminology &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;image width="90%" source="images/transformer_terms"&gt;

&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
When alternating current flows through the primary winding, it generates an alternating magnetic field in the magnetic core.  This changing magnetic field, in turn, induces a voltage in the secondary winding through electromagnetic induction.  If the secondary winding has more turns than the primary winding, the secondary voltage will be higher than the input voltage and the transformer is referred to as a step-up  transformer. Conversely, if the secondary winding has fewer turns than the primary winding the secondary voltage will be less than the primary voltage, and the transformer is a  step-down transformer. 
A transformer does not add any power to the electrical circuits only changes its form.  Because electrical power is proportional to the product of current and voltage, when the voltage steps up, the current must step down.
The relationships between the ratios of primary and secondary voltages, currents and turns are as follows: &lt;mdn&gt; &lt;mrow&gt;\frac{V_s}{V_p}\amp= \frac{N_s}{N_p}&lt;/mrow&gt; &lt;mrow&gt;\frac{I_s}{I_p}\amp= \frac{N_p}{N_s}&lt;/mrow&gt; &lt;/mdn&gt;.  Note that when the turns ratio is greater than one, the voltage steps up and the current steps down.
Beyond voltage transformation, transformers also furnish electrical isolation between primary and secondary circuits, creating physical and electrical separation while maintaining energy transfer.
Three-phase transformers can be made using three single-phase transformers, with the primary and secondary windings connected in wye or delta depending on the application.</Text>

The  feed check valve comes first. It is a stop-check valve which is normally left open, but which can be used to regulate the feed water flow to the boiler if necessary. The feed check valve is always fitted with a reach rod or other means to permit it to be manually operated from the boiler control station.
The feed check is followed by the feed water regulator which is an automatic, pneumatically actuated regulating valve that responds to changes in boiler drum level and steam demand to automatically maintain a constant water level half-way up the steam drum.
The final valve of the set is the feed stop valve. This valve is provided to permit the feed system to be secured at the boiler when necessary.

            <Text>Military time is a timekeeping system used by the military, emergency services, and other organizations. 
Instead of using a 12-hour clock with a.m. and p.m. designations, military time uses a 24-hour clock system. This system is used in contexts where clarity and precision in timekeeping are critical. It eliminates confusion  whether midnight is at the start or end of the day,  and simplifies calculations involving time intervals.

   &lt;caption&gt;24 hour clock&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="40%" source="images/clock-24.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
In military time, each hour of the day is represented by a four-digit number between 0000 and 2400. No punctuation and no a.m. or p.m. designation are used. The first two digits represent the hour, and the second two digits represent the minute.  For example, 0030 means 12:30 a.m. , 1000 means 10:00 a.m., and 1615 means 4:15 p.m. 
When speaking the time, zeros are usually pronounced using &lt;q&gt;Zero&lt;/q&gt;,  or &lt;q&gt;Hundred&lt;/q&gt;, but not &lt;q&gt;Thousand&lt;/q&gt;, so 0030 would be pronounced &lt;q&gt;Zero Zero Thirty&lt;/q&gt;, 1000 would pronounced &lt;q&gt;Ten Hundred.&lt;/q&gt;, and 1615 would be pronounced &lt;q&gt;Sixteen Fifteen&lt;/q&gt;.
Midnight is the beginning of the new day, and is represented by 0000, while 2400 represents midnight at the end of the day and is equivalent to 0000 of the following day. 1200 represents noon. Times between 0000-1159 are before noon, and times between 1201-2400 are after noon.

            <Title>Introduction</Title>
            <Text>Let’s consider first the two stored forms of mechanical energy. 
Mechanical &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; energy exists because of the relative positions of two or more objects. For example, a rock resting on the edge of a cliff in such a position that it will fall freely if pushed has mechanical potential energy. Water at the top of a dam has mechanical potential energy. A sled that is being held at the top of an icy hill has mechanical potential energy. 
Mechanical &lt;em&gt;kinetic&lt;/em&gt; energy exists because of the relative velocities of two or more objects. If you push that rock, open the gate of the dam, or let go of the sled, something will move. The rock will fall; the water will flow; the sled will slide down the hill. In each case the mechanical potential energy will be changed to mechanical kinetic energy. Another way of saying this is &lt;q&gt;energy of position will be changed to energy of motion.&lt;/q&gt;
In these examples, you will notice that an external source of energy is used to get things started. Energy from some outside source is required to push the rock, open the gate of the dam, or let go of the sled. All real machines and processes require this kind of &lt;q&gt;boost&lt;/q&gt; from an energy source outside the system. For example, there is a tremendous amount of chemical energy stored in fuel oil; but this energy will not raise steam in the boiler until you have expended some energy to start the oil burning. Similarly, the energy in any one system affects other energy systems. However, it is easier to learn the basic principles of energy if we forget about all the energy systems that might be involved in or affected by each energy process. In the examples given in this chapter, therefore, we will consider only one energy process or energy system at a time, disregarding both the energy &lt;q&gt;boosts&lt;/q&gt; that may be received from outside systems and the energy transfers that may take place between the system we are considering and other systems. 
Notice that both mechanical potential energy and mechanical kinetic energy are stored forms of energy. It is easy to see why we regard mechanical potential energy as being stored, but it is not so easy to see the same thing about mechanical kinetic energy. Part of the trouble comes about because mechanical kinetic energy is often referred to as &lt;q&gt;the energy of motion,&lt;/q&gt; thus leading to the false conclusion that &lt;q&gt;energy in transition&lt;/q&gt; is somehow involved. This is not the case, however. Work is the only form of mechanical energy that can be properly considered as energy in transition. 
If you have trouble with the idea that mechanical kinetic energy is stored, rather than in transition, think of it like this. A bullet that has been fired from a gun has mechanical kinetic energy because it is in motion. The faster the bullet is moving, the more kinetic energy it has. There is no doubt in anybody’s mind that the bullet has the capacity to produce an effect, so we may safely say that it has energy. Although the bullet is in transition, the energy of the bullet is not transferred to any other object or system until the bullet strikes some object which resists its passage. When the bullet strikes against a resisting object, then, and only then, can we say that energy in transition exists, in the form of heat and work. 
In this example, we are ignoring the fact that some work is done against the resistance of the air and that some heat results from the passage of the bullet through the air. But this does not change the basic idea that kinetic energy is stored energy rather than energy in transition. The air must merely be regarded as a &lt;q&gt;resisting object&lt;/q&gt; which causes some of the stored kinetic energy of the bullet to be converted into energy in transition (heat and work) while the bullet is passing through the air. However, the major part of the stored kinetic energy does not become energy in transition until the bullet strikes an object firmer than air which resists its passage. 
In the English system of units, mechanical potential energy is measured in foot-pounds. Consider, for example, the rock at the top of the cliff. If the rock weighs 5 pounds and if the distance from the rock to the earth at the base of the cliff is 100 feet, 500 foot-pounds of mechanical potential energy exist because of the relative positions of the rock and the earth. Another way of expressing this idea is by the formula:  
&lt;me&gt;PE = mgh&lt;/me&gt;
Where: 
&lt;ul marker=""&gt;
PE = potential energy (in foot-pounds) 
mg = total weight of the object (in pounds) 
h = distance between the earth and the object (in feet) 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Mechanical kinetic energy is also measured in foot-pounds. The amount of kinetic energy present at any one time is directly related to the velocity of the moving object and to the weight of the moving object. &lt;me&gt;KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2&lt;/me&gt;
Where: &lt;ul marker=""&gt; 
KE = Kinetic energy 
m = Mass of object 
v = Velocity of object relative to earth 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Mechanical potential energy can be changed into mechanical kinetic energy. If you push that 5-pound rock over the edge of the 100-foot cliff, it begins to fall, and, as it falls, it loses potential energy and gains kinetic energy. At any given moment, the total amount of mechanical energy (potential plus kinetic) stored in the system is the same - that is, 500 foot-pounds. But the proportions of potential energy and kinetic energy are changing all the time as the rock is falling. Just before the rock hits the earth, all the stored mechanical energy is kinetic energy. As the rock hits the earth, the kinetic energy is changed into energy in transition-that is, work and heat. 
Mechanical kinetic energy can likewise be changed into mechanical potential energy. For example, suppose you throw a baseball straight up in the air. The ball has kinetic energy while it is motion, but the amount of kinetic energy decreases and the amount of potential energy increases as the ball travels upward. When the ball has reached its uppermost position, just before it starts to fall back to earth, it has only potential energy. Then, as it falls back toward the earth, the potential energy is changed into kinetic energy again.

            <Title>Boiler Circulation</Title>
            <Text>It is important to understand the flow paths of water, steam, air and combustion gases through the boiler. This circulation is illustrated in &lt;xref ref="boilersteamflow_png"/&gt;. 
&lt;figure xml:id="boilersteamflow_png"&gt;
 &lt;caption&gt;Boiler Steam and Water Flow Paths&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;image source="pics/boilers/boilersteamflow.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
The process begins when feedwater is discharged from the feed pump, passes through the feedwater control valve, enters the economizer inlet header and flows through the economizer tubes to the outlet. The feedwater picks up about 100 to 200° of sensible heat in the economizer and exits at about 350 °F. 
The Feedwater leaves the economizer and enters the steam drum via the internal feed pipe. The feed pipe distributes the water evenly along the length of the steam drum. The coolest and densest water flows down through the downcomers, and perhaps some of the waterwall tubes, screen tubes and generating tubes, to the water drum and lower headers. From there the water is distributed to the various tubes and replaces the water which has turned to steam. 
The water in the generating tubes is exposed to the combustion gases through heat transfer across the tube walls. This increases the water temperature and decreases its density, causing it to rise upward. The water temperature increases until it reaches the saturation temperature of 486 °F, at which point steam bubbles begin to form. These bubbles are saturated steam, and they rise up and enter the steam drum, carrying liquid water along with them. 
In the steam drum, the water-steam mixture enters the cyclone separators which removes the excess water from the steam by centrifugal action. Separated water falls back to the steam drum above the baffle plates, while the steam enters the dry pipe. From there the steam flows out of the steam drum and into the superheater header. 
From the superheater header, the steam is directed into the superheater tubes, where it makes several passes through the furnace, increasing the steam temperature to approximately 850 °F, and then it exits through the outlet header. 
Superheated steam leaves the outlet header and flows to the one of three places: the main engine, the turbogenerators, or back into the boiler. The portion returning to the boiler enters the desuperheater, which is a pipe submerged below the water level in the steam drum. There the steam cools back down to near its saturation temperature, flows out through the auxiliary steam stop valve, and on to all the remaining steam consumers on the ship. 
At the same time this is occurring, air from the engine room is being drawn in by the forced draft fans, blown across the tubes of the steam air heater and down through the space between the inner and outer casing. This air then passes through the register air doors and into the furnace. Here it meets with the finely atomized fuel droplets, which quickly heat up to their ignition temperature and burn. 
The resulting combustion gases, under a slight pressure due to the forced draft fans, pass across the boiler tubes; first the screen tubes, then the superheater tubes, the generating tubes, and finally the economizer tubes, before leaving the boiler up the stack.

            <Text>Personal protective equipment (PPE) includes all clothing and other work accessories designed to create a barrier against workplace hazards. It provides an important link in the chain of workplace safety, but PPE alone is not a substitute for safe engineering design, proper training, good work practices, safety awareness, or hazard reduction. All these elements together are required to minimize the danger of workplace hazards and maximize the safety and health of workers.   
Using personal protective equipment requires hazard awareness and training on the part of the user. You must be trained to know when personal protective equipment is necessary, what type is necessary, how it is to be worn, and what its limitations are, as well as know its proper care, maintenance, useful life, and disposal. In addition, you must be aware that the equipment does not eliminate the hazard. If the equipment fails, you can be injured. To reduce the possibility of failure, equipment must be properly fitted, and maintained in a clean and serviceable condition. 
To protect yourself, you must be wearing the proper personal protective when it is needed and recognize its limitations. The equipment must not be altered or removed even though you may find it uncomfortable. In some cases however, the equipment may be uncomfortable because it does not fit properly. 
In this chapter we will discuss some of the personal protective equipment normally found and used aboard ship.

            <Title>BAR</Title>
            <Text>BAR 
The bar is defined using the SI derived unit, pascal: 1 bar= =100,000 Pa (100 kPa). =100,000 N/m2. 
1 bar is slightly less than the current average atmospheric pressure on Earth at sea level being 14.5 psia. The bar and the millibar were introduced by the Norwegian meteorologist Vilhelm Bjerknes, who was a founder of the modern practice of weather forecasting. 
One Atmosphere =\frac{USSystem}{MetricSystem} = \frac{14.7psia}{101.325kPa} = .145 
1 Bar = 100 kPa 
100 kPa X .145 = 14.5 psia 
1 Bar =14.5 psia 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;bar Gauge&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image15.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
1 Bar = 100,000 Pa 
1 Bar = 14.5 psia 
1 Bar = 750 torr 
1 Bar= 0.98 atm 
To convert 5 bars to psi, you use the conversion factor: 
1 bar = 14.5 psi 
So, for 5 bars: 
5 bars×14.5psi/bar = 73 psi 
To convert 5 bars to kilopascals (kPa), you can use the conversion factor: 
1 bar = 100 kPa 
So, for 5 bars: 
5 bars ×100 kPa/bar = 500kPa</Text>

            <Title>Controlling the Rate of Fuel Injection</Title>
            <Text>A fuel system must also control the rate of injection. The rate at which fuel is injected determines the rate of combustion. The rate of injection at the start should be low enough that excessive fuel does not accumulate in the cylinder during the initial ignition delay (before combustion begins). Injection should proceed at such a rate that the rise in combustion pressure is not excessive, yet the rate of injection must be such that fuel is introduced as rapidly as possible to obtain complete combustion. 
An incorrect rate of injection will affect engine operation in the same way as improper timing. If the rate of injection is too high, the results will, be similar to those caused by an excessively early injection; if the rate is too low, the results will be similar to those caused by an excessively late injection.

            <Title>Stop Valves</Title>
            <Text>No practical boiler could function without valves. Valves permit the operator to control fluid flow, and to isolate sections of the system for maintenance. There are dozens of valves used in the main steam cycle but in this discussion we will only mention a few of them. You may assume that valves are located throughout the system wherever they are necessary.
The main steam stop valve is located at the outlet of the superheater, and it is the primary valve used to connect or isolate the boiler from the remainder of the steam cycle.
According to US Coast Guard regulations, boilers are required to have two valve protection, that is, they are required to have two valves in series in all boiler connections. This insures that at least one valve will be functional when the time comes to secure the boiler.  The valve which provides this protection is called the bulkhead stop valve.  It is located in the main steam line, downstream of the main steam stop valve.

            <Title>Mass vs. Weight</Title>
            <Text>One important force which we experience every day is weight. A common misconception is that mass and weight are the same. They are not: weight is a force, not a mass.  
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Weight vs. Mass&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/weight-v-mass.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Weight is the force of gravity - the attraction between an object and the earth. The force exerted on an object is  proportional to the mass of the object according to Newton’s second law, which states:   &lt;men xml:id='wmg'&gt; W=mg &lt;/men&gt;, where W is weight, m is mass, and g is the local acceleration due to gravity.  Note that the weight of an object depends on both its mass and the acceleration of gravity acting on it.
The value of &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; depends on where you are: on earth the constant is greater than it  is on the moon, so you weigh less on the moon than you do on earth. In outer space, the  constant is zero, making you weightless there.  The  mass of an object will not change when it moves to another location, but its weight may. For example, on the earth's surface, a one kilogram mass weighs about 2.2 pounds, but on Mars, the same mass would weigh only about 0.8 pounds, and on Jupiter it would weigh roughly 5.5 pounds.
One reason why people often confuse weight with mass is because in the English system and on the  surface of the earth, the gravitational constant &lt;em&gt;g&lt;/em&gt; is equal to 1, and so one pound of mass has a weight of one pound of force. Move to the moon, and the pound of mass now weighs  about six tenths of a pound. On earth in the SI system,  &lt;me&gt;g = \aSI{9.8}&lt;/me&gt;. Note the units of g.   This is a metric quantity; appropriate unit conversions must be made when working with US units. See the following examples.

            <Title>Exciter</Title>
            <Text>An exciter, also known as an excitation generator, is a second generator which spins on the same shaft as the main generator.  The function of the exciter is to produce the direct current required to energize the main rotor windings, thereby creating a magnetic field. 
There are several important differences between the main generator and the exciter.  Although both are 3-phase generators, the main generator has a rotating field and a stationary armature while the exciter has a stationary field and a rotating armature.   The exciter is much smaller than the main generator; the main generator can generate more than 440 A, while the exciter generates less than 4 A.

&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
The 3-phase output of the exciter is directed through the hollow drive shaft to the rotating rectifier mounted on the non-drive end of the shaft.  The rectifier is a solid-state electronic device which uses six diodes arranged as shown in &lt;xref ref="three_phase_rectifier"/&gt; to convert the three-phase AC produced by the exciter generator into direct current. From there, DC current travels back through the shaft to excite the rotating main field windings.

            <Title>Turbocharging</Title>
            <Text>Turbocharging  occurs when the engine's own exhaust gases are forced through a turbine (impeller), which rotates and is connected to a second impeller located in the fresh air intake system. The impeller in the fresh air intake system compresses the fresh air. 
The compressed air serves two functions. First, it increases the engine's available power by increasing the maximum amount of air (oxygen) that is forced into each cylinder. This allows more fuel to be injected and more power to be produced by the engine. The second function is to increase intake pressure. This improves the scavenging of the exhaust gases out of the cylinder. Turbocharging is commonly found on high power four-stroke engines. It can also be used on two-stroke engines where the increase in intake pressure generated by the turbocharger is required to force the fresh air charge into the cylinder and help force the exhaust gases out of the cylinder to enable the engine to run.</Text>

            <Title>Engine Lubrication System</Title>
            <Text>An internal combustion engine would not run for even a few minutes if the moving parts were allowed to make metal-to-metal contact. The heat generated due to the tremendous amounts of friction would melt the metals, leading to the destruction of the engine. 
To prevent this damage, all moving parts ride on a thin film of oil that is pumped between all the moving parts of the engine. Once between the moving parts, the oil serves two purposes. One is to lubricate the bearing surfaces. The other is to cool the bearings by absorbing the friction generated heat. 
The flow of oil to the moving parts is accomplished by the engine's internal lubricating system. Oil is accumulated and stored in the engine's oil pan where one or more oil pumps take a suction and pump the oil through one or more oil filters as shown in &lt;xref ref="lube-oil-sys-pic"/&gt;. The filters clean the oil and remove any metal that the oil has picked up due to wear. The cleaned oil then flows up into the engine's oil galleries. A pressure relief valve(s) maintains oil pressure in the galleries and returns oil to the oil pan upon high pressure. The oil galleries distribute the oil to all the bearing surfaces in the engine. 
Once the oil has cooled and lubricated the bearing surfaces, it flows out of the bearing and gravity-flows back into the oil pan. In medium to large diesel engines, the oil is also cooled before being distributed into the block. This is accomplished by either an internal or external oil cooler. 
The lubrication system also supplies oil to the engine's governor, which is discussed later.

            <Title>Effects of Electrical Current on the Human Body</Title>
            <Text>Electrical shock occurs when current passes through the body.  The severity of the shock depends on the current’s magnitude, the duration, the contact area, and the path taken by the current through the body. 
The shock current received obeys &lt;xref provisional="ohms-law"&gt;Ohm’s law&lt;/xref&gt;, so high voltages are always more dangerous.  But your body resistance is equally important.  Body resistance with dry skin may be above 100,000 ohms, However, if the skin is wet or broken, the body's resistance decreases to a few thousand ohms.

            <Title>FORMULAS for Calculating Volume of different shapes </Title>
            <Text>The method for measuring volume depends on the shape of the object. For simple shapes like cubes, rectangular prisms, cylinders, and spheres, there are specific formulas you can use. For example: 
Cube: The volume of a cube or rectangular prism is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height. 
The volume, V, of a &lt;em&gt;cube&lt;/em&gt; with edge, s, is: 
V = s3

&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Cylinder&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image35.png"/&gt;
 &lt;/figure&gt;
The volume of a cylinder is calculated by multiplying the area of its base (usually a circle) by its height. 
V = π r2 h 
where r is the radius of the base and h is the height of the cylinder. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Sphere&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image36.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
The volume, V, of a sphere with radius, r, is: 
The volume of a sphere is calculated using the formula V = (4/3) πr3. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;For irregularly shaped objects, you can use techniques like water displacement, where you submerge the object in water and measure the volume of water displaced.&lt;/caption&gt;

            <Title>Torque Sensors</Title>
            <Text>Torque Transducers, also commonly known as torque sensors, torque cells, or, torque gauges  are devices that measure the torque applied to a stationary object or produced by a rotating system.  These devices convert a torque measurement (reaction, dynamic or rotary) into an electrical signal that can be integrated into control systems or used as standalone devices to provide real-time torque measurements.
Rotary torque transducers measure the torque on rotating parts such as motors, crankshafts, and gearboxes. 
Static torque transducers measure reaction torque without requiring the shaft to rotate. They are used where the torque of stationary objects needs to be measured.

            <Title>Style Guide</Title>
            <Text>&lt;blockquote&gt;
Omit needless words.  Vigorous writing is concise. 
A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell.
&lt;attribution&gt;Strunk and White, &lt;pubtitle&gt;The Elements of Style&lt;/pubtitle&gt;&lt;/attribution&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bad &lt;mdash/&gt;  &lt;q&gt;The type of friction which Statics focuses on is dry friction.&lt;/q&gt;
Good &lt;mdash/&gt; &lt;q&gt;Statics focuses on dry friction.&lt;/q&gt;
Bad &lt;mdash/&gt; &lt;q&gt;All normal forces on a FBD should be pointing at (and not away from) the body.&lt;/q&gt;
Good &lt;mdash/&gt;&lt;q&gt;Normal forces on a FBD should point towards the body.&lt;/q&gt;

Which vs. That: How to Choose
	In a defining clause, use that.
	In non-defining clauses, use which.
	Remember, which is as disposable as a sandwich bag. If you can remove the clause without destroying the meaning of the sentence, the clause is nonessential and you can use which.

Consistency
What's our point of view?  It is all over the place in the text. 
Formal or informal?
Are we directing and guiding the students?  &lt;q&gt;You start by...&lt;/q&gt;   
Are we collaborating with the students?  &lt;q&gt;We can see that...&lt;/q&gt; 
Are we the wise sage?  &lt;q&gt;Let us transition to the forces...&lt;/q&gt;
Should we avoid pronouns and just make statements?  &lt;q&gt;The result is...&lt;/q&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
Say free-body diagram, not free body diagram, alternately you can say &lt;acro&gt;FBD&lt;/acro&gt;. Never say FBD’s; you mean FBDs.
Say two-dimensional problem, not 2D problem or &lt;q&gt;two dimensional&lt;/q&gt;
Say zero-force member
There is no hyphen in two dimensions.
x axis, not x-axis.
Use US for United States, not U.S.
use double quotes &lt;tag&gt;q&lt;/tag&gt; to set off a word as a word, or better still if it is a term, use &lt;tag&gt;term&lt;/tag&gt; tag.
Use unordered lists when order is not significant.  Use ordered lists for things that need to be numbered, like a procedure.
Punctuate ordered lists with periods at the end of each item. Punctuate unordered list like one long sentence  &lt;ie/&gt;, commas or semicolons at the end of each item except the last, which gets a period
No &lt;q&gt;use your equations of equilibrium &lt;/q&gt; Yes&lt;q&gt;the equations of equilibrium.&lt;/q&gt;
Spell out clockwise and counter-clockwise, unless in space is limited, like in a table or caption.
Spell out numbers less than ten.
Maintain consistent capitalization in chapter/section titles - use title case.  
Chapter/Section titles are nouns, and short enough to fit in one line in the  pretext sidebar.
Keep an eye out for 'emphasis' quotes or ALL CAPS.  Instead use the &lt;tag&gt;em&lt;/tag&gt; tag.
Statics or statics or mechanics?  I say statics for the subject, and Statics for the course.

            <Title>Gauge pressure (psig)</Title>
            <Text>Since the absolute atmospheric pressure is always present, and acts on everything equally, we normally don’ even notice it. Pressures are usually measured up or down from atmospheric pressure, and an ordinary pressure gauge reads zero when it is subjected to atmospheric pressure only. Pressures measured in this way are called gauge pressure. It is important to distinguish between gauge pressure and the absolute pressure described in the next section. 
Gauge pressures start at zero and increase with positive values with the range dependent on what system application is being measured. 
Vacuum Gages also start at zero and increase with negative values with the greatest value of vacuum being 29.92 inHg. 
We sometimes say psig to indicate gauge pressure and other times we merely say psi. By common convention, gauge pressure is always assumed when pressure is given in pounds per square inch, pounds per square foot, or similar units. The “g” (for gauge) is added only when there is some possibility of confusion. Absolute pressure, on the other hand, is always expressed as pounds per square inch absolute (psia), and so forth. It is always necessary to establish clearly just what kind of pressure we are talking about, unless this is very clear from the nature of the discussion.

            <Text>A ton has a long history and has acquired several meanings and uses. Depending on context, a ton may refer to a unit measure of mass, volume or force. 
A metric ton (tonne)  is the mass of water which occupies \m{1} \times \m{1} \times \m{1} cube, and equals \kg{1000}.  
A deadweight ton is a measure of the weight of cargo a ship can safely carry.
In transportation, the Measurement Ton, or Shipping Ton, is a volume measure equal to one cubic meter  (\m{}^3 or CBM) .  A CBM is used in the shipping and transportation industries to describe how much space a shipment takes up, &lt;ie/&gt;  1 cubic meter .  Note that the weight of one cubic meter of water is one metric ton, but the weight of one CBM of other material will vary depending on the material's density.

            <Text>A diode is an electrical component that allows current to flow in one direction while blocking it in the opposite direction. It acts as a &lt;q&gt;one-way valve&lt;/q&gt; for electric current. Diodes are made from semiconductor materials and have two terminals: an anode (positive side) and a cathode (negative side).
Rectifier Diodes are used for converting AC to direct current DC (rectification). 
Zener diodes are used for voltage regulation and voltage reference applications. They maintain a nearly constant voltage across their terminals regardless of current changes.
Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs)  emit light when current flows through them. They are used for indicators, displays, lighting, and optical communication.

            <Title>Pipes vs. Tubes – What is the Difference?</Title>
            <Text>However, it is to note that there is a difference and it is based primarily on the rules of nomenclature of the pipes and the tubes.
In the following points we endeavor to clarify the issue:
* Pipe is rigid and resistant to bending whereas some tubes such as copper tubes and brass tubes can be flexible. However, in structural projects tubes are rigid.
* Pipes are classified by schedule and nominal diameter. For example, a 250mm nominal diameter and schedule 80 pipe.
* Tubes are classified by outside diameter and thickness. For example, 10mm copper tube 2 mm thickness.
* In pipes, all the fittings can be matched by nominal size and schedule. For example a schedule 40 one inch pipe will have fittings specified by the same name. These pipe fittings would not fit a 1” tube.
* Pipe is always round or cylindrical. Tubes may be square, rectangular and cylindrical.
* Pipes generally start from 1⁄2 inch to very large sizes. However, tubes are generally of smaller diameter only. We use a 10 inch pipe but not 10 inch tube.
* Tubes are used in applications where the outside diameter must be precise, like in cooler tubes, heat exchanger tubes, boiler tubes etc.
* Pipes are generally used to carry fluids and must contain them. They also have pressure rating and hence are scheduled.
* In tubes the thickness increases in standard steps like 1 mm thick, 2 mm thick etc. In pipes however the thickness depends on the schedule of the pipe and there is no fixed step.
* Pipe joining is more time consuming . For e.g. welding, threading, flanges with bolts etc. The tubes joining are faster using flaring, brazing, couplings etc.
* Tube dimensions are actual dimensions. Whereas the pipe dimensions are only nominal. That means that a 1” tube will have actually OD as 1”. The pipes on the other hand are named nominally, which means only for name. The 1” schedule 40 Nominal size pipe has an ID of 1.049”, OD of 1.32” and a wall thickness of 0.133”.
* Tube fittings are compression fittings such as ferrule and union nut, flared fittings, biting fittings, mechanical grip type fittings. The pipe fittings on the other hand are pipe to pipe butt welding, threaded pipe fitting connectors, flange to flange bolted fittings etc.

MEASUREMENT AND ORDERING
Stainless tubing is generally used for applications where structural support is required. This can include roll cages in cars, making monkey bars for your playground, or fabricating the support structure of a rig for hoisting. These applications require precise dimensions for the outer diameter (OD) of the tubing so that each part of the fabricated structure fits correctly. The wall thickness (WT) depends on the strength of the structure required so it doesn't bend or break when forces are exerted upon it.
On the other hand, piping is required to carry fluids throughout a process, such as those in chemical and petroleum processing plants. Here the internal diameter (ID) is more important as it specifies the fluid carrying capacity of the vessel and the flow rate, crucial to pipe sizing calculations for projects. The OD for pipes comes in standard sizes called the nominal pipe size (NPS). Additionally, the wall thickness is specified by the schedule of the pipe, important for determining the pressure rating of the pipe. The outer diameter and wall thickness enable you to calculate the internal diameter and order appropriately sized pipes with a certain strength. 


Pipes and tubes are both cylindrical hollow structures used for the transportation of fluids, gases, or solids, but they have distinct differences in terms of their design, manufacturing, and applications. Here are the key differences between pipes and tubes:

1. **Shape and Dimensions:**
   - **Pipe:** Pipes are generally round and have standardized outer diameters. They are sized based on the Nominal Pipe Size (NPS) or Nominal Diameter (DN), which corresponds to the approximate inside diameter (ID) of the pipe.
   - **Tube:** Tubes can have various shapes, including round, square, rectangular, or oval. They are typically sized based on their outside diameter (OD) and wall thickness.

2. **Manufacturing Process:**
   - **Pipe:** Pipes are manufactured using two methods: seamless and welded. Seamless pipes are produced without a seam, while welded pipes are made by welding together flat sheets of metal.
   - **Tube:** Tubes are commonly manufactured using one of three processes: seamless, welded, or drawn-over-mandrel (DOM). Seamless tubes are produced without a seam, welded tubes are made by welding together strips of metal, and DOM tubes are drawn through a die to achieve precise dimensions.

3. **Tolerances and Precision:**
   - **Pipe:** Pipes have more lenient tolerances, especially for wall thickness. They may have variations in wall thickness along their length.
   - **Tube:** Tubes are manufactured with tighter tolerances, resulting in more precise dimensions and wall thickness consistency.

4. **Applications:**
   - **Pipe:** Pipes are typically used for conveying fluids and gases in various industrial, commercial, and residential applications, including plumbing, oil and gas pipelines, and water distribution systems.
   - **Tube:** Tubes are used in a wider range of applications beyond fluid transport. They are often chosen for structural applications, such as in automotive frames, aircraft structures, and bicycle frames, as well as in heat exchangers and instrumentation.

5. **Strength and Rigidity:**
   - **Pipe:** Pipes are generally designed to handle higher internal pressures and external loads due to their thicker walls and standardized sizes. They are rigid and well-suited for applications requiring structural integrity.
   - **Tube:** Tubes may have thinner walls, making them lighter but less capable of handling high internal pressures. They are often chosen for applications where weight is a consideration.

6. **Cost:**
   - **Pipe:** Pipes are often more cost-effective for fluid transport applications because of their standardized sizes and manufacturing processes.
   - **Tube:** Tubes can be more expensive due to their tighter tolerances and versatility.

In summary, while both pipes and tubes are used for transporting materials, pipes are typically used for fluid conveyance with standardized sizes and manufacturing processes, while tubes are more versatile in shape, used in structural applications, and manufactured with greater precision. The choice between pipes and tubes depends on the specific requirements of the application.

            <Title>Power Management System</Title>
            <Text>The electrical system aboard the training vessel is fully automated by a Power Management System (PMS).
The main purpose of the PMS is to ensure that there is always a sufficient power reserve available for the essential services of the vessel.  The system continuously monitors the generators and the electrical loads, and automatically starts and stops generators to match electrical power generation to the ship’s needs.
During critical times when energy demand is exceptionally high or during emergencies, the power management system can shed or temporarily drop non-essential loads. This ensures that essential equipment and services receive power while minimizing strain on the electrical system.

These units have filters, cartridges, or canisters that remove contaminants from the air by passing the air through the air-purifying element before it reaches the user. Air purifying respirators are further divided into: &lt;ul&gt;
Particulate Respirators, which capture particles such as dusts, paint fumes, and mists, but do not protect against gases and vapors. The filters in particulate respirators generally work better as particles accumulate on the filter. If the filter becomes so clogged that it is difficult to breathe, it should be replaced. 
            Gas and Vapor Respirators, which use a chemical cartridge or canister to remove dangerous gases or vapors, but which do not protect against airborne particles. These units only protect against specific gases or vapors, and only provide protection as long as the filter’s absorbing capacity remains. 
            Combination Respirators, which can be used in atmospheres that contain both hazardous gases and particles. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <Title>Exhaust and Intake</Title>
            <Text>At 82° ATDC, with the piston near the end of its power stroke, the exhaust cam begins to lift the exhaust valves follower. The valve lash is taken up, and 9° later (91° ATDC), the rocker arm forces the exhaust valve off its seat. The exhaust gasses start to escape into the exhaust manifold, as shown in Figure 21. Cylinder pressure starts to decrease. After the piston travels three-quarters of its (down) stroke, or 132° ATDC of crankshaft rotation, the piston starts to uncover the inlet ports. As the exhaust valve is still open, the uncovering of the inlet ports lets at 43° ABDC, the camshaft starts to close the exhaust valve. At 53° ABDC (117° BTDC), the camshaft has rotated sufficiently to allow the spring pressure to close the exhaust valve. Also, as the piston travels past 48°ABDC (5° after the exhaust valve starts closing), the intake ports are closed off by the piston. The compressed fresh air enter the cylinder and helps cool the cylinder and scavenge the cylinder of the remaining exhaust gasses (Figure 22). Commonly, intake and exhaust occur over approximately 96° of crankshaft rotation.

Digital Inputs 
Figure 3-1 Simplified Hardware Function Block Diagram of HDEC 2000 
HDEC2000 unit provides seven digital inputs for pre-defined functions and three digital inputs for programmable functions. Digital inputs can be controlled by external dry contact or PLC open collector output. In all cases, the digital inputs should be connected with potential free contact (or switch). Each function of digital inputs is described below. 
Excitation ON (START/STOP) command 
This input determines the condition of excitation on (or off). If this input circuit is closed, HEC2000 unit regulates the excitation power through the power module (IGBT). If this input is opened, the excitation output power is cut off. Continuous contact should be used for this input command. 
Normally, This input may be closed while the prime mover speed is higher than specified value (typically 50 ...90% of nominal), If the prime mover speed is lower than specified value, or if the generator heavy fault signal is activated, this input should be opened. 
However, in case of shunt power application (excitation power is supplied from the transformer connected with generator output terminal) with no external control power and with no excitation input contactor, the excitation on input may be always closed. Alternatively, in this case, we recommend that the excitation input contactor may be installed for the protective purpose, and excitation on input channel may be connected with the auxiliary contact of excitation input contactor instead of external excitation on command. Figure 3-2 shows the typical schematic diagram of excitation on control for the shunt power application with no control power. 
In above case (shunt power application with no control power, and input contactor is installed), we strongly recommend that the maximum speed for excitation on is less than approximately 70% of nominal to prevent initial voltage overshoot due to hardware voltage buildup function. See the voltage buildup function for more information. 
#

Table 3-1 shows the recommended excitation on control logic depending on excitation power and external control power. However user can modify the control logic depending on application. For more relative or detailed information, see ready mode function and loss of power function in this section. Or, please contact Electro Electric Systems - Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., LTD. 
Especially, in cases that the loss of power is enabled and the loss of power option is configured with [Reset soft Start Time], even though it is not recommended, this input can be always closed for simple application. 
Manual select command (non Automatic mode) 
This input determines the basic regulation mode of HDEC2000 unit. If this input circuit is closed, HDEC2000 unit operates with FCR mode. Otherwise, the unit operates with AVR mode, VAR mode or PF mode depending on other digital inputs and configuration parameters. Continuous contact should be accepted for this input command. 
FCR mode is prior to all operating modes and functions. In the FCR mode, all limitation functions and some protective functions are disabled. 
Raiser, Lower command 
This input(s) adjusts the setpoint (reference) of active operating mode. The raise command increases the setpoint, and the Lower command decreases the setpoint of active operating mode. These actions are enabled while the corresponding input circuit is closed. If the setpoint of active operating mode reaches to its [max Setpoint] or [min Setpoint], these actions are disabled. Momentary contact should be accepted for these input commands. 
The total ramping time which is required to traverse from minimum to maximum setpoint is determined by [Setpoint Traversing Rate] parameter of active operating mode. 
MCB (Machine circuit breaker) status 
This digital input channel detects on/off status of the machine (generator) circuit breaker which connects the generator to the electrical bus or other generators. If this input channel is used, normal-opened auxiliary contact of generator circuit breaker should be connected. 
If this input circuit is closed, HDEC2000 selects either reactive droop compensation or cross current compensation depending on [CCC Enabled] parameter when the operating mode is not FCR Mode. If this input circuit is opened, HDEC2000 unit disables both the Droop (droop compensation) and CCC (cross current compensation) modes. 
The MCB status is not essential part of excitation system. Sometimes it can be omitted. If the excitation system is designed for the generator to be always operated with AVR mode without droop compensation and without CCC, MCB status input circuit can be always opened. Otherwise, if the excitation system is designed for the generator to be always operated with AVR mode with droop compensation, this input circuit can be always closed. 
Alternative, if no auxiliary contact of generator circuit breaker is available or user wants to simple hardwire configuration, the [Virtual MCB] parameter having three options (None, Close, Open) can be used instead of auxiliary contact of physical circuit breaker. The functions of three options listed below are described. But, to enable the CCC function, the auxiliary contact of physical circuit breaker is essentially required. 
[None]: MCB status of HDEC 2000 software is determined by the digital input connected with actual generator circuit breaker 
[Close]: MCB status of HDEC 2000 software is always settled with closed condition. [Open]: MCB status of HDEC 2000 software is always settled with opened condition. 
GCB (Grid circuit breaker) status 
This digital input channel normally detects the on/off status of grid circuit breaker (not machine circuit breaker) which connects the generator to the infinite power grid (not island grid) in comparison with generator output rating. If this input channel is used, normal-opened auxiliary contact of grid circuit breaker (or combined logic status of some circuit breakers) must be connected. 
The logical combination of GCB status, MCB status and related configuration parameters select either VAR mode or PF mode. Table 3-2 shows that the operating-mode selection logic depending on the digital inputs and configuration parameters. 
If MCB and GCB status are closed, and [VAR/PF Mode] is configured with [VAR] or [PF], HDEC2000 unit operates either VAR mode or PF mode while the FCR mode is not selected. The VAR mode or PF mode is selected by the setting of [VAR/PF Mode] parameter. Otherwise, HDEC2000 unit operates with AVR mode. 
#

Due to the safety reason, we recommend that this digital input channel may be connected with the logically combined status of some user’s circuit breakers which determine VAR or PF mode depending on the power grid configuration. 
Programmable #1, #2, #3 input (Command or Status) 
HDEC2000 unit provides three programmable input channels for flexible configuration. Any function pre-defined by HDEC2000 software can be assigned for the programmable digital input channel. 
If the input circuit is closed, the assigned function corresponding to its digital input channel is enabled (activated).The useable functions are listed and described below. 
[None]: No function is assigned and no action is executed. 
[Preposition]: If a corresponding input circuit is closed, HDEC2000 unit changes the setpoint of all operating modes (AVR, FCR, VAR and PF) to the pre-settled [Preposition Setpoint] of each operating mode. This function is useful for initialization of setpoint adjusted by user or for the application which required the fixed setpoint permanently. Momentary or continuous contact may be accepted for this function depending on application. 
In some cases, this function is used to prevent excessive over voltage when circuit breaker is opened from the condition that the generator operates with FCR mode, and heavy load. 
[SecondaryUnit]: This function determines that HDEC2000 unit operates with primary (master) or secondary (backup) unit for redundant application configured with two HDEC2000 units. If a corresponding input circuit is closed, HDEC2000 unit operates with the secondary unit. The secondary unit always tracks the primary unit via CAN communication. This function is not supported now, and the revision for this function is planned later. Continuous contact may be accepted for this function. 
[LocalRequest]: HDEC2000 unit can be commanded from three directions via three devices of digital input commands of left panel (local command), COM0 port (RS232) and COM2 port (RS485, read only now). This function determines that the local command (physical digital input command) is priority. 
If a corresponding input circuit is closed while the HDEC2000 unit is controlled remotely, then the commands from remote device are disregarded. Momentary contact may be accepted for this function. For more information about remote access, see separated MODBUS communication manual. 
[SecondarySoftStart]: This function is used for the special application (e.g. the different two kind’s loads are powered from one generator at different time). If corresponding input circuit is closed, The HDEC2000 unit controls the voltage setpoint by using the second soft start parameter set. Even though the status of digital input is changed during soft starting processing, the changed event is not applied, but it may be applied with next excitation on event. For more information, see soft start function. 
Alarm Reset command 
When the input circuit is closed, this input clears the latching status of all fault events of the output relay assigned for fault event, internal software fault flag, front panel fault messages and fault LED. Momentary contact may be accepted for this command. 
Analog Input and Output 
HDEC2000 unit measures nine analogue signals. The seven signals are external inputs and two other signals are internally measured. The processing procedure of analogue signals is described below. 
First, all analogue signals are converted to suitable low level by means of resistive divider, shunt resistor, current transformer or current sensor. Next, the analogue signals are transmitted to ADC (analogue to digital converter) through operational amplifiers, analogue filter circuits and MUX (multiplex). Finally, DSP (digital signal processor) performs quantization, digital filtering and signal conversion for the analogue signals. HDEC2000 unit performs control and other functions by using of these signals. 
The analogue signals measured by HDEC2000 unit are listed below: 
		 Three phase-to-phase generator voltages (A-B phase, B-C phase, C-A phase, C-A phase).  
		 GeneratorBphasecurrent  
		 Crosscurrentloopinput  
		 AuxiliaryvoltageinputandAuxiliarycurrentinput  
		 Dclinkvoltage(excitationvoltage)  
		 Excitationcurrent  Generator voltage sensing  This signal is normally measured from sensing voltage transformer installed on generator inside or generator circuit breaker cubicle.  HDEC2000 unit provides three voltage sensing range (110Vac, 220Vac and 460Vac). HDEC2000 unit automatically selects voltage measuring range by using the turn ratio of sensing voltage transformer and the generator nominal voltage.  The unit supports both single phase and three phase sensing system. In case of three phase sensing system, the average of three phase-phase voltage is obtained for the purpose of regulating. In case of single phase sensing system, the A-C phase voltage is obtained. We recommend that user designs three phase sensing system for the more stable (smaller feedback ripple) voltage feedback and the fast regulation response.  The combination of true rms technique and optimum digital filtering technique achieves very stable and fast control of the generator voltage even though the sensing voltage has very high harmonic component. This voltage sensing signal is used for most of function as well.  Generator B-phase current sensing 
		This signal is measured from current transformer having 1A or 5A secondary current. And the current transformer must be installed on generator B-phase. This signal is used for reactive droop compensation, VAR/PF control and other functions. 
		When very big induction motor is started by using only one generator, if the starting current is higher than approximately 1.5 times of rated generator current and the starting current should be limited lower than proper level, the current transformer and the current input range of HDEC2000 unit must be considered to prevent the saturation (or over range) problem of both component. 
		Cross current loop input 
		The current signal called cross current loop input for reactive differential compensation (for reactive load sharing between generators) is measured from the loop circuit consist of some current transformers having 1A secondary current. And the all current transformers must be installed on generator B-phase. 
		To obtain equal reactive load sharing by cross current compensation, the turn ratio of cross current CTs of all paralleled generators should be same based on percent output rating of each generator. 
		The 2Ω burden resistor is installed internally in the HDEC2000 unit for compensating the unequal reactive power sharing caused by different resistance of interconnection cables. By this reason, no external burden resistor is required. Also, the internal auxiliary relay controlled automatically by MCB status is installed in HDEC2000 unit. By this reason, additional auxiliary contact of generator circuit breaker is not required for the cross current compensation. 
		Auxiliary voltage input, Auxiliary current input 
		Normally, HDEC2000 unit controls the generator voltage (or other controllable parameter depending on operating mode) by using the setpoint determined by raiser (or lower) input channel. Sometimes, the auxiliary analogue signal called Auxiliary Input (auxiliary voltage or auxiliary current) adjusts the generator voltage together with raise and lower commands depending on application. 
		Two kinds of analog signal can be connected with HDEC2000 unit at the same time. Even though HDEC2000 unit measures both signals simultaneously, HDEC2000 unit controls the generator voltage by using the converting signal called analog reference, and the analog reference is converted from either auxiliary voltage or auxiliary current depending on [Aux Input Type] parameter. 
		After the analog reference is calculated from auxiliary input, the analog reference is multiplied with [AUX Gain] of each operating mode. And then, the multiplied value (analog reference * Gain) is summed up with the setpoint of each operating mode depending on [Aux Input Summing Type] parameter. Summed-up values (analog reference * Gain) are defined as a percentage of rated quantities for all operating modes.

            <Title>International System of Units (SI)/Metric (kPa)</Title>
            <Text>In the metric system, pressure is typically measured using kilopascals (kPa), which represent newtons per square meter (N/m²). One pascal is equal to one newton of force distributed over a one-square-meter area. However, this is a relatively small pressure, so in practical applications, kilopascals (kPa) or megapascals (MPa) are commonly used. 
One newton is the force needed to accelerate one kilogram of mass at the rate of one meter per second squared. So, we can say one newton is one kgm/s². 
Force Units are measured in pascals or kilopascals (newtons). 
Area Units are measured in centimeters or meters squared. 
In the SI system, pressure is described in pascals (Pa). Since Pressure = Force/Area, the equation for measuring pressure in pascals is: 
Pressure (pascals) = \frac{Force}{Area} =\frac{Newtons}{MetersSquared} =\frac{N}{m^{2}} = \frac{kg}{m s^{2}}

Pressure = \frac{Force}{Area}
   \frac{Newtons}{Meterssquared}= \frac{F = ma}{MetersSquared} = \frac{kgxM/s^{2}}{MetersSquared}=\frac{Forceduetogravity = 9.8m/s^{2}}{Area}</Text>

As discussed in &lt;xref ref="AC_generators"/&gt;, the essential components of an AC generator are the armature and the field, one of which is located on the rotor and the other on the stator.  However a practical generator requires many other components, including an enclosure, bearings, cooling, lubrication, instrumentation and control, and a method to excite the field.  
These components are shown in &lt;xref ref="generator"/&gt; and  &lt;xref ref="generator_exploded"/&gt; and discussed below.
The shaft is supported by two journal bearings (7 and 13), one on the drive end (DE) and the other on the non-drive end (NDE).  Each bearing has its own integral oil sump with sight glass, cooling fins, and an oil ring that circulates the oil to the top of the shaft as it rotates. 
The shaft itself supports and carries the rotating components: primarily the main rotor core (9) and the 8-pole main field windings (4), but also a cooling fan (2) and several other components (10, 11, 12, 14, 16, and 19) that are required to excite the generator.  Excitation systems will be discussed in &lt;xref ref="Electric-propulsion-excitation-system" /&gt;. 
The main field (4) on the rotor is wound to create eight alternating north and south poles. The main stator core (8) surrounds the main rotor (9) and is wound with three main armature windings (3).  As the shaft rotates, the rotor’s magnetic field sweeps by the each of the three armature windings in turn, and induces a sinusoidal voltage in each as shown in &lt;xref ref="three-phase"/&gt;.  The resulting 3-phase AC is directed to the generator terminals (23), and from there connections are made to the main switchboard.

              &lt;/ol&gt;
          &lt;/p&gt;
Both the main core and the stator core are made of thin sheets of electrical steel, called laminations, clamped tightly together. The stationary armature windings (3) and the rotating field windings (4) are inserted into slots formed when the laminations were pressed out, and are firmly wedged in to hold them in position. 
Electrical steel is a speciality steel used in the cores of electrical machines such as motors, generators, and transformers. It is an iron alloy with silicon (instead of carbon) as the main additive element. Silicon increases the electrical resistivity of iron by a factor of about 5.  Electrical steel also has favorable magnetic properties which tend to reduce magnetic hysteresis &lt;mdash/&gt; an energy loss caused by the repeated magnetization and de magnetization of the core.  These properties reduce energy losses in the core by about three times compared to conventional steel,
The laminations are insulated from each other to prevent current from flowing axially along the core.  These currents, called eddy currents, are another source of energy loss, so using insulated laminations improves the generator efficiency.  
Generators produce lots of heat while they are operating due to unavoidable losses caused by mechanical friction and electrical resistance, and other factors.  If this heat is not removed as it is produced, the generator temperature will rise to unacceptable limits, and high temperature is extremely damaging to electrical insulation. Electrical machines are designed to run for 100,000 hours or more when operated at or below their design temperature limit, however for every 10° C rise above this temperature, the thermal life expectancy of the electrical insulation is reduced by half, so generator cooling is critical.
The generator’s cooling system uses the shaft driven internal fan (2) to circulate the air through the machine. This hot air passes over a water-cooled heat exchanger where it is cooled and then recirculated.  The cooling water tubes are double walled with slotted plate fins. Water flows through the inner tube and cools the outer tube and the slotted fins. Air flows between the fins and around the outer tubes and so is cooled.  
In the case of a tube leak,  water will flow between the inner and outer tubes to a leak detector and trigger an alarm.  This prevents water from leaking on to the electrical components.
If for some reason the cooling water is not available, an  emergency cooling mode is available.  In this mode  cover plates on the generator are removed to allow the fan to draw cool air from the engine room and discharge the heated air outside the generator.

            <Title>Capacitors</Title>
            <Text>A capacitor is an electrical component that stores and releases electrical energy in an electric field. It consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material called a dielectric. When a voltage is applied across the plates, electric charges accumulate on the plates, creating an electric field between them.
When a capacitor is charged in this way, energy is stored in the electric field.  Capacitors can be discharged to quickly provide short bursts of power.  They are often used for energy storage, filtering, and smoothing voltage fluctuations.

Ceramic capacitors are widely used due to their small size, low cost, and versatility. They are suitable for general applications like decoupling, filtering, and timing.
Electrolytic capacitors are used in high capacitance and energy storage applications, such as power supply filtering and voltage regulation.
Variable capacitors, also called trimmer capacitors or tuning capacitors, they allow manual adjustment of capacitance values, vital in tuning circuits and calibration</Text>

   &lt;image source="images/GateValve.png" width="50%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
A gate valve, &lt;xref ref="GateValve_png"/&gt;, is called for when you don’t need to   regulate flow, only turn it on or off. To open a gate valve, the moving part, called the     &lt;em&gt;gate&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;wedge&lt;/em&gt;, is moved across to the fluid flow path unblocking the   opening in the valve, called the &lt;em&gt;seat&lt;/em&gt;. The gate is actually slid off the   surface of the seat sideways. Sliding the gate back over the seat blocks fluid flow and   closes the valve. 
When open, fluids follow a straight, unobstructed path through the valve creating a   minimal pressure drop across the valve. This is the principle advantage of a gate valve   over a globe valve; it has a much lower restriction to flow when fully open. 
Gate valves are designed to be fully open or fully closed. They should not be left   partially open to regulate fluid flow. The fluid flow under a partially open gate causes   the gate to swing back and forth. This could cause the gate to hit the seats (sometimes   called &lt;em&gt;chattering&lt;/em&gt;) creating damage to the machined surfaces of the seat and   gate leading to leakage when the valve is closed. 
A gate valve, like a globe valve, is constructed in two basic parts, the body, and the   bonnet.

            <Text>A solenoid is an electromechanical device that consists of a coil of wire wound around a cylindrical core. When electric current passes through the wire coil, it generates a magnetic field around the coil. This controllable magnetic field is used to produce various effects.
Solenoids are used in various applications, such as in relays, solenoid valves, actuators, &lt;etc/&gt; Solenoid operated device contain an armature, which is a movable part placed near the solenoid coil that responds to the magnetic field generated by the current flowing through the coil and produces mechanical motion. 
For example, electromagnetic relays control the switching of electric circuits. When the solenoid coil is energized, it generates a magnetic field that can either attract or repel the movable armature to open or close a contact.  When the coil is de-energized a spring restores the contact to its normal position.

            <Title>Volume</Title>
            <Text>Volume is the amount of three-dimensional space an object or substance occupies. It is a scalar quantity, meaning it has magnitude but no direction. The concept of volume is used to quantify the extent of a region in space and is typically expressed in cubic units. Volume measures capacity. 
6.5.2 Units for Measuring Volume 
These are some of the most commonly used units for measuring volume, but there are others as well, depending on specific contexts and regions. Also, there may be &lt;em&gt;dry&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;wet&lt;/em&gt; measures of volume. 
US Standard System: In the US standard system, volume is typically measured in cubic feet (ft³) or cubic inches (in³). 
The primary units for measuring volume include: 
Cubic Inch (in³): The cubic inch is a small unit of volume commonly used in engineering and manufacturing contexts. 
Cubic Foot (ft³): The cubic foot is a larger unit of volume often used in construction and real estate. One cubic foot is equivalent to the volume of a cube with sides of one foot. There are 1,728 cubic inches in one cubic foot. 
Fluid Ounce (fl oz): The fluid ounce is commonly used for measuring liquid volumes, especially in the context of beverages and cooking. 
Pint (pt): The pint is a unit of liquid volume. In the U.S., there are two types of pints: the liquid pint (equal to 16 fluid ounces) and the dry pint (used for measuring dry goods). 
Quart (qt): The quart is a unit of liquid volume. Like the pint, there are two types: the liquid quart (equal to 32 fluid ounces) and the dry quart. 
Gallon (gal): The gallon is a larger unit of liquid volume, equal to 128 fluid ounces. 1 US gallon is equivalent to 231 cubic inches.

Barrel: The amount of liquid a barrel contains can vary depending on the type of barrel and its size. The most common types of barrels used for liquids are oil barrels and whiskey barrels. The standard size for an oil barrel is 42 US gallons (approximately 159 liters). However, there are also other sizes used in different regions and industries. It’s important to note that the capacity of a barrel can vary depending on its construction and specific dimensions, but these are the standard sizes for these types of barrels.

Metric System: The standard unit for measuring volume in the International System of Units (SI) is the cubic meter (m³) or cubic centimeters (cm³). 
Similar to the US standard system, the volume of regular-shaped objects is determined by multiplying the three dimensions in metric units. For example, if you have a rectangular prism with dimensions 2 meters by 4 meters by 1 meter: Volume = Length × Width × Height Volume = 2 m × 4 m × 1 m = 8 m³ 
In the metric system, volume is typically measured using the liter (L) as the standard unit. The liter is equivalent to 1 cubic decimeter (dm³). The cubic meter (m³) is the standard unit for larger volumes. Here are some common metric units for measuring volume: 
Cubic Meter (m³): The cubic meter is the SI unit for volume and is equal to the volume of a cube with sides of one meter. 
Liter (L): The liter is commonly used for everyday measurements of liquid volumes. One liter is equal to 1 cubic decimeter. 
Milliliter (mL): The milliliter is a smaller unit used for precise measurements of liquids. One milliliter is equal to one-thousandth of a liter. 
Cubic Centimeter (cm³): The cubic centimeter is often used in scientific and medical contexts for measuring the volume of small objects or substances. It is equivalent to one milliliter. 
In summary, the liter is the most common unit for expressing volume in the metric system, especially in everyday situations. The cubic meter is used for larger volumes, and smaller units like milliliters and cubic centimeters are used for more precise measurements. The metric system provides a straightforward and decimal-based system for measuring volumes, making it widely adopted in scientific and everyday applications around the world. 
The Ton: A Ton has a long history and has acquired several meanings and uses. 
Depending on context, a ton may refer to a unit measure of mass, volume or force. For volume, it could be a dry or wet measure. 
In transportation, one metric ton can be equal to one cubic meter (CBM) of volume. A CBM is a unit of measurement used in the shipping and transportation industries to show how much space a shipment takes up: 1 meter x 1 meter x 1 meter (or 1 cubic meter). 
The amount of liquid that one ton contains depends on the density of the liquid. Density is a measure of how much mass is contained in a given volume. 
Density is &lt;em&gt;the ratio of the mass to the volume&lt;/em&gt; of a substance: 
Density =\frac{Mass}{Volume} = ρ = m / V 
Density of Water - US System 
Mass (m) refers to the amount of water measured in pounds (lbs.). 
Volume (V) refers to the volume of water measured in cubic feet (ft³). 
One cubic foot of water weighs 62.4 lbs. @ 39.2°F 
Density =\frac{Mass}{Volume}= 62.4 lbs. =\frac{62.4lbs}{{1ft}^{3}} = 62.4 lb./ft³ 
Density (ρ, rho): The density of water in pounds per cubic foot (lbs./ft³) is 62.4 lbs./ft³ 
Density of Water Metric System 
One cubic meter of water weighs 1000 kilograms (kg) @ 4°C 
Volume equals one cubic meter 
Density = \frac{1000kg}{{1m}^{3}} = 1000 kg/m^{3}
   &lt;em&gt;English or Long Ton = 2240 lb. (1016.05 kg)&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;American or Short Ton' = 2000 lb. (907.18 kg)&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;Tonne or Metric Ton' = 1000 kg (2204.62 lb.)&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;Measurement or Shipping Ton = 1 cubic meter.&lt;/em&gt;
So, the volume of one ton of liquid depends on the density of the particular liquid you're considering. 
6.5.3 Instruments for Measuring Volume 
When dealing with regular-shaped objects like cubes or rectangular prisms, you calculate the volume by multiplying the length, width, and height of the object. For instance, the volume of a cube with sides measuring 3 feet each is calculated as follows: Volume = Length × Width × Height Volume = 3 ft × 3 ft × 3 ft = 27 ft³. 
Various instruments are used to measure volume, and the choice of instrument depends on the nature of the substance being measured (solid, liquid, or gas) and the required level of precision. Here are some common measuring instruments for determining volume: 
A Graduated Cylinder is a cylindrical container marked with calibrated lines to indicate volume. It is commonly used in laboratories to measure the volume of liquids. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption/&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Beakers are cylindrical or conical containers with volume markings. While they are not as precise as graduated cylinders, they are often used for approximate volume measurements. 
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
A gas syringe is used to measure the volume of gases in chemical reactions. The plunger is pushed or pulled to change the volume, and the graduations on the syringe indicate the volume of the gas. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption/&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/gas-syringe.png"/&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Geometric Instruments (for Irregular Shapes): For irregularly shaped objects, displacement methods or geometric instruments like Archimedes' principle can be used to determine volume. 
Laser scanners use laser technology to create a three-dimensional point cloud representation of an object's surface. By analyzing the point cloud, engineers can calculate the object's volume with high accuracy. 
6.5.4 Volume Measurements Aboard Ship 
In the nautical world, understanding volume measurements is crucial for various maritime activities and engineering projects. Two nautical-specific volume measurements are: 
Displacement Volume: In naval architecture, displacement volume refers to the volume of water displaced by a floating vessel, such as a ship or boat. It is an essential measurement for determining a vessel's buoyancy and stability. 
Cargo Capacity: For shipping and maritime logistics, measuring the cargo capacity of a vessel is vital. It involves calculating the available space inside the ship to transport goods, ensuring efficient and safe cargo handling. 
Along with these are the measurements of various liquids held in tanks aboard ships. To determine this we use &lt;em&gt;soundings.&lt;/em&gt;
What is Sounding? 
Checking the level of the fluid in a tank is considered part of the sounding process on ship. The final sounding value of the tank is the total quantity of fluid (oil, bilge, sludge, or water) inside a ship’s tank. The initial process is to first measure the depth of the fluid from the surface to the bottom of the tank by using sounding tape. 
The sounding tape value is later used in calculation of the final sounding value, which is derived using the sounding table, taking the list and trim of the ship into account and the temperature at which the fluid (specifically for oil) is stored (as density of oil is affected by temperature). 
Importance of Sounding 
Is it necessary to take soundings of various tanks every day? Yes. 
In some cases, the sounding has to be taken in every watch. A ship is a floating factory with several mechanical systems working continuously. These systems require fuel oil, lube oil and water to operate, and these fluids are consumed from service tanks or sump tanks. The service and sump tanks on a ship need to be sounded every watch to ensure the level is maintained. 
The service tanks and sump tanks levels are maintained by filling them up with appropriate fluid using storage tanks, which are sounded once in a day. 
The four most important operations which are dependent on the sounding values are: 
Stability of the Ship: The ship stability highly depends on how various fluids (oil, water, fluid cargo etc.) are stored to tackle the free surface effect, which is a very important factor for defining ship’s stability 
Voyage Planning: The current volume of fluids (oil, water etc.) in various tanks and the estimated volume needed to reach the next port or complete a voyage needs to be known before the ship sails. This is to ensure a minimum quantity is always maintained even when a ship is diverted to a longer route so that the essential fluids used to run machinery and systems do not get consumed early, which may leave the ship stranded. Also, to plan bunkering of fuel or receiving of fuel, vendors need to be notified well ahead of time for making arrangements in preferred port of call, hence sounding of all tanks in a ship is very important. 
Cargo Planning: The cargo loading and arrangement of the cargo at different bays or holds are performed by the planner based on the current stability of the ship. The knowledge of volume in various tanks is important to perform this task to avoid damage to the ship structure and to avoid any other risk to ship’s stability. 
For Assessing Leakages/Loss: Regular monitoring and keeping record of sounding for tanks containing oil and water is necessary for detecting unwanted leakages or loss of content from the tank. For example, if an oil storage tank which is not in use shows a decrease in the sounding value, it might be due to an open/malfunctioning valve of the tank or due to leakage from the tank. Also, the sounding values of service tanks in the engine room are used to determine the fuel/lube oil consumption by machinery. 
Methods for taking sounding on a ship 
Certain cargos carried on ships are toxic, hazardous and inflammable, hence various methods are provided on a ship to measure the volume in the tank. Some of the most common gauging methods used on ships are: 
Manual sounding 
All important tanks on ships are provided with sounding tubes through which a person can insert a sounding tape to measure the level in the tank manually. 
Sounding tape comes in meters or feet and is normally made up of brass and steel with a weighted bob attached at the end of the tape using a strap hook. See &lt;xref ref="sounding-tape-1"/&gt; and &lt;xref ref="sounding-tape-2"/&gt;. Sounding tape is the most commonly used method used for calculation of tank capacity. 
&lt;figure xml:id="sounding-tape-1"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Innage Sounding Value is the measure from the top of the liquid to the bottom of the sounding tube (using innage/plumb bob). See &lt;xref ref="sounding-innage"/&gt;below. 
&lt;figure xml:id="sounding-innage"&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Innage Sounding&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image31.png"/&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Ullage Sounding Value is the measure from the top of the liquid (using ullage bob) to the top of the sounding tube. See &lt;xref ref="sounding-ullage"/&gt;. 
&lt;figure xml:id="sounding-ullage"&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Ullage Sounding&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image32.png"/&gt;
   Content Placeholder 5
&lt;/figure&gt;
Electronic Sounding Gauges: In electronic sounding, a sensor is used which senses the pressure inside the sounding pipe or by sensing the tank pressure and sends a signal to the receiver. Here the signal is translated to the tank’s content value with the help of a PLC circuit. The value is displayed using an electrically operated servo gauge or electrical capacitance gauge. 
Electrically Powered Servo-Operated Gauges: This tank gauging system is based on the principle of displacement measurement. A small displacer is accurately positioned in the liquid medium using a servo motor. The displacer is suspended on a measuring wire that is wound onto a finely grooved drum housing within the instrument. 
Pneumercator (Bubbler) Gauges: This gauging system works on the principle of hydrostatic pressure measurement to determine liquid level. The pressure created by the actual depth of liquid is fed to the gauge which moves the reading until an equilibrium is reached. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Pneumercator (Bubbler) Gage&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image32.jpeg"/&gt;
   Content Placeholder 7
&lt;/figure&gt;
Ultrasonic Gauges: This works on principle similar to that of an echo sounder wherein an ultrasonic wave is thrown from the gauge. The sensor detects the echo from the surface and routes it back to the microprocessor for a digital representation of the distance between the sensor and the surface level. 
Mechanical Sounding Gauges: Mechanical provisions are made inside the tank so that the quantity of a tank can directly be read through a level marker, an indicator, or a float level sensor. In the tank a float can be attached to a pointer through a pulley. As the level varies, the pointer reading will change accordingly. A level gauge glass is also attached to the tank to read the quantity of the fluid inside the tank. The gauge may also be a pneumatic/hydraulic operated gauge or differential pressure gauge. 
Bunkering or Taking on Fuel Oil Aboard Ship 
Bunker Calculation: Bunker quantity calculations are critical calculations which every marine engineer should be familiar with throughout his/her career. Bunker fuel, being a highly valued product, has to be very carefully and accurately calculated for determining the quantity. 
The volume of a definite quantity of bunker increases with an increase in temperature whereas its weight remains the same. For this reason, the bunker is always ordered and measured in weight and not by volume. 
The density of fuel oil (in kg/m^{3}) at a standard reference temperature of 15⁰C is always provided by the supplier in &lt;em&gt;Bunker Delivery Note&lt;/em&gt;. With this, the density of fuel oil at tank temperature can be determined using an ASTM table or using software most commonly installed on all ship’s computer.

&lt;/figure&gt;
FORMULAS for Calculating Volume of different shapes 
The method for measuring volume depends on the shape of the object. For simple shapes like cubes, rectangular prisms, cylinders, and spheres, there are specific formulas you can use. For example: 
Cube: The volume of a cube or rectangular prism is calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height. 
The volume, V, of a &lt;em&gt;cube&lt;/em&gt; with edge, s, is: 
V = s3
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Cylinder&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image35.png"/&gt;
   Picture 112
&lt;/figure&gt;
The volume of a cylinder is calculated by multiplying the area of its base (usually a circle) by its height. 
V = π r2 h 
where r is the radius of the base and h is the height of the cylinder. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Sphere&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image36.png"/&gt;
   Picture 111
&lt;/figure&gt;
The volume, V, of a sphere with radius, r, is: 
The volume of a sphere is calculated using the formula V = (4/3) πr3. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;For irregularly shaped objects, you can use techniques like water displacement, where you submerge the object in water and measure the volume of water displaced.&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image37.png"/&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Examples of Volume (capacity) 
The basic unit of volume in the metric system is a cube, 10 centimeters on each side. Contained in this cube are 1,000 cubic centimeters or one liter. A liter contains slightly more liquid than a quart. Very large volumes may be measured in cubic meters (1 cubic meter = about 264 gallons). 
   &lt;em&gt;Liquid Measure&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;$Scr_Ps::1&gt;linebreak --&gt;1 liter = 1.057 (1) quart&lt;$Scr_Ps::1&gt;linebreak --&gt;1 quart = .9464 (1) liter&lt;$Scr_Ps::1&gt;linebreak --&gt;1 liter = .2642 (.25) gallons&lt;$Scr_Ps::1&gt;linebreak --&gt;1 gallon = 3.785 (4) liters&lt;$Scr_Ps::1&gt;linebreak --&gt;1 dekaliter (dal) = 2.642 (2.5) gallons 
   &lt;em&gt;Dry Measure&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;$Scr_Ps::1&gt;linebreak --&gt;1 cubic meter = 1.308 (1.3) cubic yards&lt;$Scr_Ps::1&gt;linebreak --&gt;1 cubic yard = .7646 (.76) cubic meters&lt;$Scr_Ps::1&gt;linebreak --&gt;1 bushel = 1.244 (1.25) cubic feet&lt;$Scr_Ps::1&gt;linebreak --&gt;1 bushel = .0352 (.035) cubic meters&lt;$Scr_Ps::1&gt;linebreak --&gt;1 cubic meter = 28.38 (30) bushels 
Understanding volume is essential in various scientific fields, including physics, chemistry, engineering, and biology. It is used to describe the capacity of containers, the displacement of fluids, the size of objects, and many other aspects of spatial measurements. 
In summary, you can calculate volume using specific formulas depending on the shape of the object. 
Mastering the concept of volume will be indispensable in your engineering endeavors. Whether you're designing structures, analyzing fluid flows, or working on nautical projects, understanding volume measurements will enable you to tackle complex challenges and create innovative solutions that shape the world around us.

            <Text>Diesel engines have as many different types of starting circuits as there are types, sizes, and manufacturers of diesel engines. Commonly, they can be started by air motors, electric motors, hydraulic motors, and manually. The start circuit can be a simple manual start pushbutton, or a complex auto-start circuit. But in almost all cases the following events must occur for the starting engine to start.  &lt;ol&gt;
The start signal is sent to the starting motor. The air, electric, or hydraulic motor, will engage the engine's flywheel. 
The starting motor will crank the engine. The starting motor will spin the engine at a high enough rpm to allow the engine's compression to ignite the fuel and start the engine running. 
The engine will then accelerate to idle speed. When the starter motor is overdriven by the running motor it will disengage the flywheel. 
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Because a diesel engine relies on compression heat to ignite the fuel, a cold engine can rob enough heat from the gases that the compressed air falls below the ignition temperature of the fuel. To help overcome this condition, some engines (usually small to medium sized engines) have glowplugs. Glowplugs are located in the cylinder head of the combustion chamber and use electricity to heat up the electrode at the top of the glowplug. The heat added by the glowplug is sufficient to help ignite the fuel in the cold engine. Once the engine is running, the glowplugs are turned off and the heat of combustion is sufficient to heat the block and keep the engine running. 
Larger engines usually heat the block and/or have powerful starting motors that are able to spin the engine long enough to allow the compression heat to fire the engine. Some large engines use air start manifolds that inject compressed air into the cylinders which rotates the engine during the start sequence.

The key element is the Bourdon tube, a C-shaped tube typically made of metal such as brass, bronze, or stainless steel.  A Bourdon tube gauge relies on the elasticity and mechanical properties of the Bourdon tube to sense pressure.  When pressure is applied, the tube straightens or uncoils slightly.  This deformation is transmitted through a linkage and gear to a pointer, which moves across the calibrated dial to indicate the pressure.

&lt;/figure&gt;
Bourdon tube gauges are simple, robust, and they require no external power. They are durable, capable of withstanding harsh environments and high pressures, and provide reasonably accurate readings for many industrial applications.  However, there are some limitations. Bourdon tube gauges can be sensitive to extreme temperatures, which may affect their accuracy. Over time, the moving parts may wear out, necessitating maintenance or replacement.  Additionally, they are not suitable for very low or very high-pressure measurements beyond their design specifications.
All bourdon tube gauges measure gage pressure, that the indicator points to zero when they are connected to atmospheric pressure.  All other measurements are relative to this zero value.</Text>

            <Text>The first stage heater is followed by the second stage heater, which is usually referred to as the DC Heater.  The DC Heater is the point in the steam cycle where condensate becomes feed water. 
The DC heater provides a second stage of regenerative feed heating, which is accomplished by mixing low pressure steam directly with the condensate.  In other words, the heat exchange occurs by direct contact, hence the name.   The DC Heater is also sometimes called &lt;em&gt;deaerating feed tank&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;DFT&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;deaerator&lt;/em&gt;, as well as the &lt;em&gt;second stage heater&lt;/em&gt;.

            <Text>An engineering casualty occurs when a component, machine, or system aboard ship fails to serve the purpose for which it was installed. Casualties can usually be traced to a failure of a component of the engineering system or to operator error. While some casualties are insignificant or can be easily rectified, others can lead to catastrophic consequences if not attended to quickly and effectively. Engineering casualty control is concerned with the prevention, minimization, and correction of these casualties.

            <Title>Smoke</Title>
            <Text>Fuel burns by chemically reacting with the oxygen in the air provided by the forced draft fans. An incorrect mixture of fuel and air will cause the boiler to produce smoke, which must be avoided to comply with environmental laws and maximize boiler efficiency. 
Since the chemical reaction of the combustion process is understood, and we know that air contains about 21% oxygen and 79% nitrogen, we can calculate precisely how many pounds of air are required to burn each pound of fuel completely. If the combustion control system admitted exactly this much air however, the combustion would still be incomplete, because we can’t insure perfect mixing of all the air with the fuel. Some of the available oxygen would never reach the unburned fuel droplets. To avoid this problem, a properly operated boiler always provides some &lt;em&gt;excess air&lt;/em&gt; beyond the amount theoretically required, to insure complete combustion. Too much excess air will cause unnecessary heat loss up the smokestack, reducing the boiler’s efficiency. 
One way to monitor the amount of excess air is to watch the color of the smoke produced by the boiler. A properly operated boiler will have a colorless or light exhaust; black smoke indicates insufficient combustion air for the amount of fuel, and white smoke indicates the opposite. The boiler is equipped with a periscope smoke indicator which allows the operator to look through the stack to observe the color of the exhaust gases. The periscope should be checked frequently, and the fuel/air ratio adjusted as necessary to maintain a clear stack with a minimum of excess air. Be aware that a clear stack may still have too much air; try reducing the air until a light haze develops, then increase slightly. Be alert also that heavy white smoke appears black in the periscope because it completely blocks the light. 
Watching the color of the smoke is a fairly crude method to maintain proper oxygen trim. A more precise method is to use an oxygen monitoring system to detect the level of O2 in the stack gases and use it to adjust the excess air with a feedback control loop.

            <Title>Introduction</Title>
            <Text>Pressure is the measure of a perpendicular force exerted per unit area on the boundaries of a substance (or system). It is caused by the collisions of the molecules of the substance with the boundaries of the system. As molecules hit the walls, they exert forces that try to push the walls outward. The forces resulting from all of these collisions cause the pressure exerted by a system on its surroundings. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Pressure acting on a body&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/pressure-on-body.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Pressure is directly proportional to force and inversely proportional to the area over which the force is applied. Increasing the force applied to a surface or decreasing the area increases the pressure. 
Mathematically, pressure is expressed as:  &lt;me&gt;Pressure = \frac{Force}{Area}&lt;/me&gt;</Text>

Cam-lock connectors uses foldable tabs on the female half to lock the receiver in place. This type of connection is used in applications involving hoses, such as sewage pumping or fire hoses. 
Push-to-connect fittings function by pushing one end into the other. To disconnect, a collar needs to be retracted. 
Twist or bayonet fittings utilize a 1/8 to 1/4 turn to connect and disconnect. Aboard ship, compressed air hoses for pneumatic tools often use twist fittings.</Text>

            <Title>Cylinder Heads and Valves</Title>
            <Text>A diesel engine's cylinder head performs several functions. First, they provide the top seal for the cylinder bore or sleeve. Second, they provide the structure holding exhaust valves (and intake valves where applicable), the fuel injector, and necessary linkages. A diesel engine's heads are manufactured in one of two ways. In one method, each cylinder has its own head casting, which is bolted to the block. This method is used primarily on the larger diesel engines. In the second method, which is used on smaller engines, the engine's head is cast as one piece (multi-cylinder head). 
Diesel engines have two methods of admitting and exhausting gasses from the cylinder. They can use either ports or valves or a combination of both. Ports are slots in the cylinder walls located in the lower 1/3 of the cylinder liner. See Figure 2 and Figure 3 for examples of intake ports, and note their relative location with respect to the rest of the engine. When the piston travels below the level of the ports, the ports are "opened" and fresh air or exhaust gasses are able to enter or leave, depending on the type of port. 
The ports are then "closed" when the piston travels back above the level of the ports. Valves (refer to figure 8) are mechanically opened and closed to admit or exhaust the gasses as needed. The valves are located in the head casting of the engine. The point at which the valve seals against the head is called the valve seat. Most medium-sized diesels have either intake ports or exhaust valves or both intake and exhaust valves.

            <Text>Speed is a scalar quantity that describes how fast an object is moving. It is the rate at which an object covers distance. Speed does not have a direction; it only has magnitude. There are different ways to measure speed: &lt;ul marker=""&gt;
Instantaneous Speed is the speed of an object at a particular moment in time. Imagine looking at a car's speedometer at a specific instant; the reading is the car's instantaneous speed.
Average Speed the instantaneous speed averaged over a period of time. Average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken to travel that distance. &lt;me&gt;\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}&lt;/me&gt; 
Rotational Speed refers to how fast an object rotates or spins. It is often measured in revolutions per minute (RPM) or radians per second.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
A knot is a unit used to describe the speed of ships.  One knot is equal to one nautical mile per hour, which is approximately 1.15 miles per hour or 1.85 km/hour.  </Text>

            <Text>Motor controllers electromechanical devices that control the operation of electric motors, and allow them to be operated manually, by automation or both.  
Motor controllers come in various types and forms, ranging from simple relay-based control systems to complex microcontroller-based systems. The choice of motor controller depends on factors such as the specific application requirements, the types of motors being used, and the desired levels of control sophistication.
Motor controllers usually provide three basic functions: starting, stopping, and motor protection.  The controller monitors the motor circuit and will secure the motor if it detects common faults such as overload, short circuits, or low voltage conditions.  
Additional functions such as direction control, speed control, regenerative braking, and reduced voltage (soft) starting, can be added to the control circuitry when required by the application.  Many modern motor controllers also provide diagnostic information and feedback about motor performances, temperatures, and statuses.  This information helps with troubleshooting and preventive maintenance.

            <Title>Absolute Pressure</Title>
            <Text>Absolute pressure is a pressure measurement on a scale that increases from zero, where zero corresponds to the vacuum of space. Absolute pressure is always higher than the corresponding gage pressure by the amount of the atmospheric pressure. For shipboard purposes, you can simply add 14.7 psi to the gage reading in psi to get the absolute pressure. For example, a gage pressure of 100 psig would be the same as an absolute pressure of 114.7 psia. 
We sometimes say psig to indicate gage pressure and other times we merely say psi. By common convention,  when pressure is given in psi, pounds per square foot, or similar units, gage pressure is assumed. The &lt;q&gt;g&lt;/q&gt; (for gage) is added only when there is some possibility of confusion. Absolute pressure, on the other hand, is always expressed as pounds per square inch absolute (psia), pounds per square foot absolute (psfa), and so forth. 
It is important to distinguish between gage pressure and absolute pressure. Unless otherwise stated, pressure usually means gage pressure, not absolute pressure.

            <Title>Length Units</Title>
            <Text>In the US standard system, the inch (in) 1” (double apostrophe) is the primary unit, with the foot (ft) 1’ (single apostrophe) and mile (mi) used for larger distances.
In the metric system, the base unit for length is the meter (m). Its subdivisions include the centimeter (cm), millimeter (mm). The kilometer (km), equivalent to 1,000 m is used for longer distances.
For navigation on water (marine), air, and space, the Nautical Mile (NM) unit of length is used.

            <Title>Routine operations</Title>
            <Text>While on watch, operations should always be conducted according to ship's policy, standing orders, U.S. and international regulations, and orders from your superior officers.  When the plant is in maneuvering status, the throttles must be continuously manned, and all equipment used for maneuvering must be ready for immediate use. You must carry out any bridge orders promptly.  

The plant status, operational requirements, personnel, and material condition of the machinery are constantly changing so you must keep yourself advised of the status of everything in the engine room by making regular rounds of the machinery space.  In particular, you should look for any equipment that is out of service, expected to malfunction, or that requires special attention which may affect engineroom operations.

You should operate all machinery according to standard procedure and the manufacturer's instructions and make routine adjustments as necessary to keep the plant running smoothly.  Some examples of routine operations include:

*	responding to alarms,
*	taking on make up feed,
*	changing over tank suctions and discharge,
*	shifting and cleaning strainers, and
*	changing over to stand-by equipment.

However, you must obtain permission from the bridge before conducting out any operations that have effects outside the engineroom.  Examples include:

*	blowing tubes,
*	starting the main engine jacking gear, 
*	spinning the engine with steam, and 
*	pumping bilges.

Significant changes in the alignment of the main or auxiliary plants should only be made under the cognizance of the chief engineer, for example: 

*	lighting off the boiler,
*	warming up the main engines,
*	securing after "finished with engines," and
*	changing over generators.</Text>

            <Title>Compression Ratio and Clearance Volume</Title>
            <Text>Clearance volume is the volume remaining in the cylinder when the piston is at TDC. Because of the irregular shape of the combustion chamber (volume in the head) the clearance volume is calculated empirically by filling the chamber with a measured amount of fluid while the piston is at TDC. This volume is then added to the displacement volume in the cylinder to obtain the cylinders total volume. An engine's compression ratio is determined by taking the volume of the cylinder with piston at TDC (highest point of travel) and dividing the volume of the cylinder when the piston is at BDC (lowest point of travel), as shown in Figure 15. This can be calculated by using the following formula: &lt;me&gt;\text{Compression Ratio} =  \frac{\text{displacement volume} - \text{ clearance volume}} {\text{clearance volume}}&lt;/me&gt;.

            <Title>Torque and Gear Ratios</Title>
            <Text>It is often necessary to increase or decrease the torque produced by a motor to suit different applications. Recall that the length of a &lt;em&gt;lever&lt;/em&gt; can increase or decrease the force on an object at the expense of the distance through which the lever must be pushed. Similarly, the torque produced by a motor can be increased or decreased through the use of gearing. An increase in torque comes with a proportional decrease in rotational speed. The meshing of two gear teeth can be viewed as equivalent to the interaction of a pair of levers as shown in &lt;xref ref="gear-ratio"/&gt;.
When a larger gear drives a smaller one, for one rotation of the larger gear the small gear must complete more revolutions - so the output will be faster than the input. If the situation is reversed, and a smaller gear drives a larger output gear, then for one rotation of the input the output will complete less than one revolution – so the output will be slower than the input. The ratio of the sizes of the two gears is proportional to the speed and torque changes between them.

            <Title>Short Circuits</Title>
            <Text>A short circuit is an unintentional low-resistance pathway between two points at different voltage levels.  Shorts can occur between two points in the same circuit, or between a single point and ground. 
By Ohm’s law, when the resistance is small the resulting current will be large. Large short circuit currents can lead to overheating, damage, fire hazards or arc flash. Electric shock may be caused by a short circuit through the human body.
In a properly protected circuit, a circuit breaker or fuse should quickly open to interrupt the short circuit current.
Short circuits can are caused by faulty or incorrect wiring, insulation failure, and particularly by human error.</Text>

            <Text>&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt; Nicolaus Otto (1832)&lt;/caption&gt; 
  &lt;image source="images/diesel-image3.png" width="25%"/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
The first practical alternative to the steam engine was invented in 1861 Nicolaus August Otto. Later, in partnership with German industrialist Eugen Langen, they improved the design and won a gold medal at the World Exposition in Paris of 1867.  In 1876, Otto, then a traveling salesman, chanced upon a newspaper account of the Lenoir internal combustion engine. Before year's end, Otto had built an internal combustion engine, utilizing a four-stroke piston cycle. 
Otto's design called for four strokes of a piston to draw in and compress a gas-air mixture within a cylinder resulting in an internal explosion.  He received patent #365,701 for his gas-motor engine, now called the Otto cycle in his honor. Because of its reliability, efficiency, and relative quietness, more than 30,000 Otto cycle engines were built in the next 10 years. He also developed low-voltage magneto ignition systems for his engines, allowing a much greater ease in starting. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt; Rudolf Diesel (1858) &lt;/caption&gt;
  &lt;image source="images/diesel-image4.png" width="25%"/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
Dr. Rudolf Diesel was born in 1858 in France and began his career as a refrigeration engineer. For ten years he worked on various heat engines, including a solar-powered air engine. Diesel's ideas for an engine where the combustion would be carried out within the cylinder were published in 1893. 
The modern diesel engine came about as the result of the internal combustion principles first proposed by Sadi Carnot in the early 19th century. Dr. Rudolf Diesel applied Sadi Carnot's principles into a patented cycle or method of combustion that has become known as the &lt;q&gt;diesel&lt;/q&gt; cycle. His patented engine operated when the heat generated during the compression of the air fuel charge caused ignition of the mixture, which then expanded at a constant pressure during the full power stroke of the engine. Dr. Diesel's first engine ran on coal dust and used a compression pressure of 1500 psi to increase its theoretical efficiency. Also, his first engine did not have provisions for any type of cooling system. Consequently, between the extreme pressure and the lack of cooling, the engine exploded and almost killed its inventor. After recovering from his injuries, Diesel tried again using oil as the fuel, adding a cooling water jacket around the cylinder, and lowering the compression pressure to approximately 550 psi. This combination eventually proved successful. Production rights to the engine were sold to Adolphus Bush, who built the first diesel engines for commercial use, installing them in his St. Louis brewery to drive various pumps.</Text>

            <Text>The IMO has developed guidelines for rest requirements to address the issue of fatigue among seafarers. These guidelines are outlined in the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW Convention). 
The STCW Convention sets out minimum hours of rest for seafarers. The standard requires that seafarers receive a minimum of 10 hours of rest in any 24-hour period and a minimum of 77 hours of rest in any 7-day period. The hours of rest may be divided into no more than two periods, with one period being at least 6 hours in length.
In situations where the safety of the ship, crew, or passengers is compromised, and in cases of emergencies or drills, the rest period may be temporarily shortened or interrupted. However, the seafarers should be provided with compensatory rest as soon as possible.

            <Title>Overspeed Device</Title>
            <Text>Because a diesel is not self-speed-limiting, a failure in the governor, injection system, or sudden loss of load could cause the diesel to overspeed. An overspeed condition is extremely dangerous because engine failure is usually catastrophic and can possibly cause the engine to fly apart. 
An overspeed device, usually some type of mechanical flyweight, will act to cut off fuel to the engine and alarm at a certain preset rpm. This is usually accomplished by isolating the governor from its oil supply, causing it to travel to the no-fuel position, or it can override the governor and directly trip the fuel rack to the no-fuel position.</Text>

            <Title>Crankshaft</Title>
            <Text>The crankshaft transforms the linear motion of the pistons into a rotational motion that is transmitted to the load. Crankshafts are made of forged steel. The forged crankshaft is machined to produce the crankshaft bearing and connecting rod bearing surfaces. The rod bearings are eccentric, or offset, from the center of the crankshaft. This offset converts the reciprocating (up and down) motion of the piston into the rotary motion of the crankshaft. The amount of offset determines the stroke (distance the piston travels) of the engine (discussed later).

   &lt;image source="images/crankshaft-pic.png" width="70%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
The crankshaft does not ride directly on the cast iron block crankshaft supports, but rides on journal bearings, as shown in &lt;xref ref="crankshaft-pic"/&gt;. The connecting rods also have journal bearings between the crankshaft and the connecting rods. The bearings are lined with of a soft metal alloy that provides a replaceable wear surface and prevents galling between two similar metals (i.e., crankshaft and connecting rod). Each bearing is split into halves to allow assembly of the engine. The crankshaft is drilled with oil passages that allow the engine to feed oil to each of the crankshaft bearings and connecting rod bearings and up into the connecting rod itself. 
The crankshaft has large weights, called counterweights, that balance the weight of the connecting rods. These weights ensure an even (balance) force during the rotation of the moving parts.

            <Title>Pressurizing and Distribution of Fuel</Title>
            <Text>Before injection can be effective, the fuel pressure must be sufficiently higher than that of the combustion chamber to overcome the compression pressure. The high pressure also ensures penetration and distribution of the fuel in the combustion chamber. Proper dispersion is essential if the fuel is to mix thoroughly with the air and to burn efficiently. While pressure is a prime contributing factor, the dispersion of the fuel is influenced, in part, by atomization and penetration of the fuel. (Penetration is the distance through which the fuel particles are carried by the kinetic energy imparted to them as they leave the injector or nozzle. Friction between the fuel and the air in the combustion space absorbs this energy.) 
If the atomization process reduces the size of the fuel particles too much, they will lack penetration. Lack of sufficient penetration results in ignition of the small particles of fuel before they have been properly distributed or dispersed in the combustion space. Since penetration and atomization tend to oppose each other, a degree of compromise in each is necessary in the design of fuel injection equipment, particularly if uniform distribution of fuel within the combustion chamber is to be obtained. The pressure required for efficient injection and, in turn, proper dispersion is dependent on the compression pressure in the cylinder, the size of the opening through which the fuel enters the combustion space, the shape of the combustion space, and the amount of turbulence created in the combustion space.

            <Text>&lt;!-- TODO Replace all illustrations in this section with non copyright images --&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Temperature&lt;/term&gt; is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. It quantifies how hot or cold an object or environment is relative to a standard or reference point.
The most commonly used temperature scale in the US today is the &lt;term&gt;Fahrenheit scale&lt;/term&gt;, abbreviated F. In this scale, water freezes at 32 degrees and boils at 212 degrees. (This only holds strictly when atmospheric pressure equals the average sea level pressure. At high altitudes, water boils at a lower temperature, as anyone who cooks in the mountains knows.)
Another common scale is the &lt;term&gt;Celsius&lt;/term&gt; (also called Centigrade) scale. In this scale, water freezes at 0 degrees and boils at 100 degrees.
There are also temperature scales in which zero is the lowest possible temperature, called absolute zero. (People have gotten close to absolute zero, but have never reached it. According to theory, we never will.) Absolute zero is at -273.15 Celsius, or -459.67 Fahrenheit.
The &lt;term&gt;Kelvin&lt;/term&gt; temperature scale uses the same size degree as Celsius, but has its zero set to absolute zero.
The &lt;term&gt;Rankine&lt;/term&gt; temperature scale uses the same size degree as Fahrenheit, but has its zero set to absolute zero
The Celsius and Kelvin scales are part of the International System of Units (SI), providing a standardized and widely adopted system for expressing temperatures. Celsius is the more common scale for everyday use, while Kelvin is often used in scientific and thermodynamic calculations.

            <Title>Main Condenser</Title>
            <Text>As stated before, the main condenser is a shell and tube heat exchanger which provides the low pressure zone for the turbine to discharge into. A typical main condensers consists of three main parts: the shell, the tubes, and the tube sheets. Cold sea water enters the shell at the inlet water head or water box, flows across the condenser through the tubes, and is discharged overboardThe steam entering the condenser turns back to liquid water when it comes in contact with the cold condenser tubes. The newly formed condensate drains down to the bottom of the condenser, where it collects in the hot well until it is pumped out.
In order to maintain high plant efficiency it is necessary to maintain a good vacuum in the main condenser. This vacuum is formed by the collapse of the steam as it condenses, since the specific volume of water is so much less than the specific volume of steam. A properly operating main condenser operates at 28.5 in Hg vacuum or greater.
Vacuum will be maintained in the condenser as long as the shell of the condenser does not fill up with air or other gases, however vacuum tends to draw air into the condenser through any available leaks, such as those found at the turbine glands where the turbine shafts penetrate the turbine casing. This air must be pumped back out to the atmosphere as fast as it leaks in, or else vacuum will be lost. This is accomplished with a steam driven pump known as the air ejector which takes suction on top of the main condenser and discharges air to the engine room.
Vacuum will also be lost if condensing stops. This could happen if the supply of cooling water through the condenser tubes was interrupted, perhaps due to failure of the main circulating pump, blocked condenser tubes, or if the condensate pump failed which would cause the condenser to fill up with condensate.

            <Text>Electricity is the backbone of modern civilization, supporting nearly every aspect of our lives.  Most people have used electricity every day of their lives without giving it much thought.  Electricity is not a single thing, rather the term encompasses a broad range of phenomena associated with the presence and movement of charged particles. Electricity is related to magnetism, both being part of the phenomenon of electromagnetism, as described by Maxwell's equations. 
Electrical phenomena include static electricity, electrical discharges like lightning and sparks, electromagnetic waves like light and x-rays, electromagnitism, electrical generation by induction, chemical reaction, and photoelectric effects; power transmission through conductors, resistance heating, conversion of electrical power to motion, and more. 
In this chapter we will define some basic electrical concepts and describe some important electrical devices in order to give you a framework to understand how we harness and use electrical power aboard the training ship.

            <Title>Introduction</Title>
            <Text>The purpose of the excitation system is to excite the generator’s field.  That is, the system supplies the DC voltage and current to the generator’s main field windings that creates the magnetic field required for electrical generation.  The amount of excitation current determines the strength of this field, which in turn affects the generator output.
Generator excitation systems consists of several components that work together excite the field, maintain a constant and correct output voltage despite fluctuations in the load or other system conditions, and balance the reactive power when the generator is operating in parallel.
There are several different excitation system designs in use, each with particular advantages and disadvantages. These can be broadly categorized as separately or self excited, and brushed or brushless excitation systems.
In a separately excited excitation system, the excitation current is provided by an external DC power source. The generator's field winding is connected to a separate power supply, which is independent of the generator's output.  Separately excited generators tend to be more stable and less sensitive to load fluctuations because the excitation current is not affected by the generator's output. They provide better voltage regulation and are commonly used in applications that require precise control.
A self-excited system, on the other hand, uses the generator’s own output voltage to produce the excitation current. The generator's output voltage is connected, in parallel, to both the field circuit and to the load. In this design, generator excitation is effectively an additional load on the generator.  Self-excited generators are simpler and less expensive, but are inherently less stable and more sensitive to load changes due to the coupling between the generator load, output voltage, and excitation current. Voltage regulation is more difficult, especially under sudden changes in load.
Brushed exciters use carbon brushes and copper slip rings to transmit the excitation current to the rotating generator rotor winding. Brushed exciters are simple and inexpensive and they were once widely used; however, they require significant maintenance including cleaning, adjustment, and periodic replacement of worn brushes.  They are being superseded by brushless exciters in new generators.
Brushless exciters use solid-state devices, such as diodes, thyristors, and transistors mounted on the rotating shaft, to rectify the output voltage of the exciter generator.  They eliminate the need for brushes and slip rings, so are more reliable, require less maintenance, and offer better voltage control than brushed exciters.

            <Title>Power</Title>
            <Text>
   &lt;em&gt;Power&lt;/em&gt; is defined as the amount of energy used per unit time or rate of doing work. It has the units of watt, Btu, horsepower, or ft-lb/sec. Power is a measure of the rate at which energy is used. 
Regarding work, when you lift a weight of 1 pound through a distance of 1 foot, you have done 1 foot-pound of &lt;em&gt;work,&lt;/em&gt; regardless of whether you do it in half a second or half an hour. A device which can do a lot of work quickly is powerful. Power, however, is time dependent. Therefore, if you lift that same 1-pound weight over the same distance more quickly, you are more powerful! 
The common unit of measurement for power is the &lt;em&gt;horsepower&lt;/em&gt; (hp). 
Power is a critical physical quantity that defines the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred or converted. In the world of engineering, power plays a significant role in designing efficient systems, analyzing energy consumption, and optimizing engineering solutions. Understanding power and its measurement is essential for creating sustainable technologies, enhancing performance, and addressing real-world challenges. Let's explore how power is measured in both the US standard and metric systems, the instruments used for measurement, and any nautical-specific measurements related to power. 
Forms of Power 
In the context of science, power can refer to different concepts depending on the specific field or application. Here are several forms of power in various scientific contexts: 
Mechanical Power: In classical mechanics, mechanical power is the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred. It is the product of force and velocity. Mechanical power is the term used to describe when work is being done. 
Electrical Power: In electrical systems, power is the rate at which electrical energy is transferred or converted. It is measured in watts and is the product of voltage and current. 
Thermal Power: In thermodynamics, thermal power refers to the rate at which heat energy is transferred or converted. It is often measured in watts and is associated with processes involving temperature differentials. Thermal power is the term used to refer to the transfer of heat. 
Nuclear Power: In the context of nuclear physics, power can refer to the rate of energy release in nuclear reactions. Nuclear power is harnessed in nuclear reactors for electricity generation. 
Solar Power: This is a form of power derived from the sun's radiation. Solar power can be harnessed through various technologies such as photovoltaic cells and solar thermal systems. 
Wind Power: Wind power is the conversion of wind energy into a useful form, typically electricity, using wind turbines. 
Hydraulic Power: In fluid dynamics, hydraulic power is associated with the movement and pressure of fluids. It is often utilized in hydraulic systems for various applications. 
Chemical Power: In chemistry, chemical reactions can release or store energy. Chemical power is associated with the energy changes in chemical reactions. 
Muscular Power: In biology and biomechanics, muscular power refers to the rate at which work is done by muscles. It is often expressed in terms of force and velocity of muscle contraction. 
Photon Power: In optics, the power of a lens is a measure of its ability to converge or diverge light. It is often measured in diopters. 
UNITS of POWER 
Power is measured in various units depending on the context and the system of measurement being used. The standard unit of power in the International System of Units (SI) is the watt (W). Here are some common units of power: 
Watt (W): The watt is the SI unit of power and is defined as one joule per second. It is named after James Watt, a Scottish engineer. 
Kilowatt (kW): One kilowatt is equal to 1,000 watts. It is commonly used in the context of electrical power, especially in the rating of appliances and electrical systems. 
Megawatt (MW): One megawatt is equal to 1 million watts or 1,000 kilowatts. This unit is often used in the context of large-scale power generation and distribution. 
Gigawatt (GW): One gigawatt is equal to 1 billion watts or 1,000 megawatts. It is commonly used to express the capacity of power plants or large energy systems. 
Calories per Second (cal/s or kcal/s): In some contexts, especially in the field of nutrition and metabolic studies, power can be expressed in terms of calories per second. 
BTU per Hour (BTU/h): In the field of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), power is sometimes measured in British Thermal Units per hour. 
Horsepower (hp): Horsepower is a unit of power that is still used in various industries, particularly in the context of engines and motors. One horsepower is approximately equal to 745.7 watts. 
Foot-Pound per Minute (ft-lb/min): This unit is often used in the context of mechanical power, where work is done over time. 
These units provide a way to quantify and compare the rate at which energy is transferred or converted in various scientific and engineering applications. 
In the context of mechanics and engineering, mechanical power refers to the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred within a mechanical system. It is a measure of how quickly energy is used or produced in a mechanical process. The unit of mechanical power is the watt (W). 
   &lt;em&gt;Measurement of Power:&lt;/em&gt;
US Standard System: 
In the US standard system, power is typically measured in horsepower (hp). One horsepower is equivalent to 550 foot-pounds per second (ft-lb/s) or approximately 746 watts. It is a common unit used to express the power output of engines, motors, and other mechanical systems. 
One mechanical horsepower is defined as the ability to do 550 foot-pounds of work per second. In other words, if a machine can exert a force of 550 pounds over a distance of one foot in one second, it is considered to have a power output of 1 mechanical horsepower. This definition was based on Watt's observations of the work done by draft horses in coal mines and was intended to provide a meaningful measure of power that people could relate to in the late 18th century. 
While the original concept of horsepower was rooted in the comparison to the work done by horses, it has become a standard unit of power used in various industries, particularly in the automotive and mechanical engineering fields, to express the power output of engines and motors. 
By definition, 1 horsepower is equal to 33,000 foot-pounds of work per minute or 550 foot-pounds of work per second. 
Thus, a machine that is capable of doing 550 foot-pounds of work per second is said to be a 1-horsepower machine. (As you can see, your horsepower rating would not be very impressive if you did 1 foot-pound of work in half an hour. Figure it out. It works out to be just a little more than one-millionth of a horsepower.) 
Horsepower (hp) is a unit of measurement in the foot-pound-second (fps or ft-lb/s) or English system, sometimes used to express the rate at which mechanical energy is expended. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;A horse produces approximately one horsepower&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image48.png"/&gt;
   Horsepower - Wikipedia
&lt;/figure&gt;
Metric System: 
In the metric system, power is measured in watts (W). One watt is defined as one joule per second (J/s), representing the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred. The watt is the standard unit for expressing power in the International System of Units (SI). 
In the International System of Units (SI), power is typically measured in watts. One mechanical horsepower is equivalent to approximately 745.7 watts. The conversion factor is often rounded to 746 watts for practical use. So, when you see a power rating for an engine or motor in horsepower, it represents the mechanical power output of that device. 
Power Formulas 
The formula for mechanical power is derived from the basic definition of power: 
Mechanical Power (P)=\frac{Work(w)}{Time(t)}
​Alternatively, if the system involves a force (F) acting over a distance (d), the formula for mechanical power can be expressed as: 
   &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=\frac{Fxd}{t}
​In this formula: 
   &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; is the mechanical power 
   &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt; is the work done, 
   &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; is the force applied, 
   &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; is the distance over which the force is applied, 
   &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; is the time taken. 
Mechanical Power 
Mechanical energy used per unit time is called &lt;em&gt;mechanical power&lt;/em&gt;. Mechanical power is the rate at which work is done. Mechanical power is expressed in units of joules/sec (joules/s) or a watt (W) in the metric system, and feet - pounds force per second (ft-lbf/s) or horsepower (hp) in the English system. Mechanical power can be calculated using the following mathematical expression. 
Power= \frac{WorkDone}{Timerequired}
Because work can be defined as force times distance, we can also use the following equation: 
   &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=\frac{Fxd}{t}

Mechanical Power Problem US Customary Units 
A worker uses a winch to lift a 200-pound load to a height of 30 feet in 2 minutes. Calculate the mechanical power in foot-pounds per minute. 
Mechanical power (P) can be calculated using the formula: 
Power= \frac{WorkDone}{Timerequired}
where: 
W is the work done in foot-pounds (ft-lb) 
T is the time in minutes (min) 
First, calculate the work done (W). Work done is given by: 
W=F×d 
where: 
F is the force applied (in pounds, lb) 
D is the distance the load is lifted (in feet, ft) 
Given: 
F=200 lb. 
d=30 ft 
Calculate the work done (W): 
Power= \frac{WorkDone}{Timerequired}
   &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=\frac{Fxd}{t}
W=F×d=200 lb×30 ft=6000 ft-lb 
Next, calculate the power (P): 
Mechanical Power (P)=\frac{Work(w)}{Time(t)}
Power = \frac{6,000ft - lbs}{2minutes}
Answer: 
The mechanical power used by the winch is 3000 foot-pounds per minute (ft-lb/min). 
Note that the work required is the same even with more people pulling the load. 
Mechanical Power Problem Metric System Units 
Given: 
Force (F) =50 (Newtons) N 
Distance (d)=20 (Meters) m 
Time (t)=10 seconds (s) 
Step-by-step calculation: 
Calculate the work done W=F⋅d=50 N×20 m=1000  
Calculate the power: Power (P)=\frac{Work(w)}{Time(t)} = \frac{1000j}{10s} =100 J/s 
So, the mechanical power delivered by the conveyor belt is 100 joules per second. 
Horsepower Formula: Horsepower = \frac{Work}{Timex33,000}
Horsepower may also be expressed as 
1 hp = \frac{33,000foot - pounds}{minute} or 
1 hp = \frac{550foot - pounds}{second}
Horsepower Problem: 
A motor exerts a force to lift a weight of 500 pounds vertically at a constant speed of 660 feet per minute. Calculate the horsepower delivered by the motor. 
Solution: 
Recall the definition of horsepower: 
1 horsepower (hp)=33,000 foot-pounds per minute (ft-lb/min) 
Given: 
Force F = 500 pounds 
Speed = 660 feet per minute 
Power in foot-pounds per minute is calculated as: 
Horsepower = \frac{Work}{Timex33,000} = \frac{Forcexdistance}{timex33,000}
   &lt;me&gt;Horsepower = \frac{500lbsx660feet}{33,000ft - lbs/min}&lt;/me&gt;
Horsepower = 10hp 
Thermal Power Problem in British Thermal Units (BTU’s) 
   &lt;em&gt;Thermal power&lt;/em&gt; is the measure of thermal energy used per unit time. It is the rate of heat transfer or heat flow rate. Examples of thermal power units are British Thermal Units (Btu) or kilowatts (kW). Thermal power is calculated basically by the mathematical expression of: 
Thermal Power= \frac{HeatUsed}{TimeRequired}
P= \frac{Heat}{time} = \frac{Q(btu's)}{t(s)}
Problem: 
A heating system uses 90,000 btus of heat energy to warm a room over a period of 15 minutes. Calculate the thermal power output of the heating system in btus). 
To calculate the thermal power output of the heating system, we can use the formula: 
P= \frac{Heat}{time} = \frac{Q(btu's)}{t(s)}
In this case: 
The energy used is 90,000 BTUs. 
The time period is 15 minutes. 
First, we need to convert the time period from minutes to hours since power is typically measured in BTUs per hour (BTU/hr). 
15 minutes=15/60 hours=0.25 hours 
Now, we can calculate the power: 
Power=90,000 BTUs/0.25 hours​ 
Power=360,000 BTU/hr 
So, the thermal power output of the heating system is 360,000 BTU/hr. 
Electric Power Problem in Watts 
When dealing with electrical power, it's essential to consider the relationship between power, voltage, and current, which is given by the formula: 
   &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=&lt;em&gt;VI&lt;/em&gt;
where: 
   &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; is power in watts (W) 
   &lt;em&gt;V&lt;/em&gt; is voltage in volts (V) 
   &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; is current in amperes (A) 
Problem: 
An electric heater has a resistance of 10 ohms and is connected to a 120-volt power supply. Calculate the electrical power consumed by the heater in watts. 
Solution: 
Electrical power (P) can be calculated using Ohm's law and the power formula: 
P=​ \frac{V^{2}}{R}
where: 
P is the power in watts (W) 
V is the voltage in volts (V) 
R is the resistance in ohms (Ω) 
Given: 
V=120 V 
R=10 Ω 
First, substitute the given values into the formula: 
P= ​ \frac{V^{2}}{R} P=​ \frac{120^{2}}{10\Omega}
P= \frac{14400v}{10\Omega} = 1440 watts (W) 
Answer: 
The electrical power consumed by the heater is 1440 watts (W). 
Power is expressible also as the product of the &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; applied to move an object and the speed of the object in the direction of the force. If the magnitude of the force &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; is measured in pounds and the speed &lt;em&gt;ν&lt;/em&gt; in feet per minute, the power equals &lt;em&gt;Fν&lt;/em&gt; foot-pounds per minute. In the &lt;em&gt;International System of Units&lt;/em&gt;, power is measured in &lt;em&gt;newton&lt;/em&gt; meters per second. 
Most machines have rotating &lt;em&gt;shafts&lt;/em&gt;, and, in terms of the twisting moment, or magnitude of &lt;em&gt;torque&lt;/em&gt; (τ), on a shaft and the angular speed ω of the shaft, the power is given by τω. τ is usually expressed in inch-pounds, ω in radians per second, and power in inch-pounds per second. Another unit of mechanical power is the &lt;em&gt;horsepower&lt;/em&gt; (hp), which is equal to 33,000 foot-pounds per minute, or 6,600 inch-pounds per second. 
Instruments Used to Measure Power: 
Dynamometer: an instrument used to measure torque and power output of engines, motors, and other rotating machinery. By measuring the torque and rotational speed, the dynamometer can calculate the power output of the system. 
Power Meter: an electronic device used to measure electrical power consumption. It is commonly used to monitor and optimize the energy usage of electrical devices and systems. 
Nautical-Specific Power Measurements 
In the nautical world, power measurements are crucial for marine engineering, ship propulsion, and navigation. Two nautical-specific power measurements are: 
Propulsion Power: Propulsion power refers to the power required to drive a ship or boat through water. It is a key parameter in designing efficient propulsion systems and optimizing fuel consumption for maritime vessels. 
Dynamic Positioning Power: Dynamic positioning (DP) systems are used on ships and offshore platforms to maintain their position without anchoring. The power required for DP operations is a critical consideration in offshore engineering projects. 
Understanding the concept of power and its measurement is vital in your journey as engineering students. It will empower you to design energy-efficient systems, optimize power consumption, and contribute to sustainable engineering practices both on land and at sea. 
Speed 
Speed measures how fast an object is moving through a distance, and it is calculated by the formula 𝑆=𝑑𝑡, where &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; stands for speed, &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; stands for distance, and &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; stands for time. This formula calculates the average speed of a movement, and refers to the rate at which an object moves or operates. It is a measure of how quickly something changes position or performs a function over a given period. Speed is a scalar quantity, meaning it has magnitude but no direction. It is usually expressed in units of distance per unit time, such as meters per second (m/s), kilometers per hour (km/h), or miles per hour (mph). 
Speed and velocity are terms that are often used interchangeably. However, in scientific and educational contexts the differences between them tend to be highlighted. This happens because they are two different types of quantities. While speed is a scalar quantity, velocity is a vector. Speed is defined only by its intensity (or magnitude), while velocity needs to have both magnitude and direction addressed. 
The concept of speed is better understood when contrasted with the concept of velocity. 
Speed is a measurement of how fast an object is moving through a path. 
Velocity measures how fast and to what direction is the movement of an object. 
The symbols for speed and velocity differ by the letters used and the notation that represents the type of quantity they are. While velocity is usually symbolized by the letter &lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt; with an overwritten arrow (𝑣→), one can find speed being symbolized by its full name ('speed') or by its first letter (&lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt;). The lack of an arrow over this symbol is an indication that speed is a scalar quantity. 
Types of speed 
Linear Speed: The rate at which an object moves along a path in a straight line. It is calculated as the distance traveled divided by the time taken. 
Speed=Distance/Time​ 
Rotational Speed (Angular Speed): The rate at which an object rotates or spins. It is measured in terms of the angle turned per unit time, such as radians per second (rad/s) or revolutions per minute (RPM). 
Angular Speed=Angle/Time​ 
Average Speed: The total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, without regard to variations in speed during the trip. 
Average Speed=Total Distance/Total Time​ 
&lt;figure&gt;

   &lt;title/&gt;
   &lt;tabular&gt;
      &lt;row/&gt;
   &lt;/tabular&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
The graph shows that the object covers 20 meters in 25 seconds. Therefore, its average speed is: 
𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑=𝑑𝑡=2025=0.8𝑚/𝑠 
Instantaneous Speed: The speed of an object at a specific moment in time. It can be found using calculus by taking the derivative of the position with respect to time. 
Flow Speed: In fluid dynamics, the speed at which a fluid flows through a pipe or channel. It is critical for calculating parameters such as Reynolds number and flow rate. 
Mach Number: In aeronautical engineering, the speed of an object compared to the speed of sound in the surrounding medium. A Mach number less than 1 indicates subsonic speed, while a Mach number greater than 1 indicates supersonic speed. 
Units of Speed 
Metric System: 
Centimeters per second (cm/s): Occasionally used for smaller-scale measurements, particularly in scientific contexts. 
Meters per second (m/s): This is the standard SI unit for speed. It indicates the number of meters traveled in one second. 
Kilometers per hour (km/h): This unit is often used for measuring the speed of vehicles and other modes of transportation. It indicates the number of kilometers traveled in one hour. 
US Customary System 
Miles per hour (mph): Commonly used in the United States and the United Kingdom for measuring the speed of vehicles. It indicates the number of miles traveled in one hour. 
Feet per second (ft/s): Sometimes used in various engineering contexts, especially in the United States. 
Nautical Units: 
Knots (kn or kt): Used in maritime and aviation contexts, a knot is equal to one nautical mile per hour (1 nautical mile = 1.852 kilometers). 
Nautical-Specific Speed Measurements: In the nautical realm, measuring speed is crucial for marine navigation and engineering. 
Knot: A knot is a unit of speed used primarily in navigation and marine contexts. One knot represents one nautical mile per hour (nautical mile is approximately 1.15 statute miles). Ships and boats often use knots to measure their speed over water. 
Rotational Speed: 
Revolutions per minute (RPM): Used to measure the number of complete rotations or cycles per minute. 
Radians per second (rad/s): Used in engineering to measure angular speed 
Various instruments are used to measure speed, depending on the context and type of speed being measured. Here are some common instruments: 
Speedometer: Commonly found in vehicles, it measures the speed of the vehicle in units such as kilometers per hour (km/h) or miles per hour (mph). Instruments, such as the speedometer, can display the instantaneous speed of a vehicle. 
Radar Gun: Often used by law enforcement to measure the speed of moving vehicles. It works by emitting radio waves and measuring the Doppler shift of the reflected waves. 
Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging): Uses laser pulses to measure the distance to an object and can determine its speed by analyzing the time it takes for the laser to return. 
Pedometer: Measures the number of steps taken and can estimate speed based on stride length and the number of steps per minute. 
GPS (Global Positioning System): Uses satellite signals to determine the position of an object over time, calculating speed based on changes in position. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Speedometer showing an instantaneous speed of 172.1 Km/h.&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image35.jpeg"/&gt;
   Speedometer showing an instantaneous speed of 172.1 Km/h.
&lt;/figure&gt;
For Measuring Rotational Speed: 
Tachometer: Measures the rotational speed of a shaft or disk, typically in revolutions per minute (RPM). 
Stroboscope: Uses flashing light to measure rotational speed by making a rotating object appear stationary when the light flashes at the same frequency as the rotation. 
Optical Encoders: Detect rotational position and speed by using light and photodetectors to measure the movement of a patterned disk. 
For Measuring Flow Speed: 
Pitot Tube: Used in aerodynamics and fluid dynamics to measure the flow speed of air or fluid by comparing static and dynamic pressures. 
Anemometer: Measures wind speed, commonly used in meteorology and environmental studies. 
Flowmeter: Measures the speed and volume of fluid flowing through a pipe. Types include ultrasonic, electromagnetic, and turbine flowmeters. 
For Measuring Instantaneous Speed: 
Accelerometer: Measures acceleration, which can be integrated over time to determine changes in speed. 
Photo Gates: Used in physics experiments to measure the speed of an object passing through two points with a known distance apart. 
Specialized Instruments: 
Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV): Uses laser beams to measure the velocity of particles in a fluid, often used in fluid mechanics research. 
Doppler Radar: Measures the speed of precipitation particles in meteorology to determine wind speeds and storm movement. 
Each of these instruments is designed for specific applications and provides accurate measurements within its intended range and context. 
Magnetic Speed Pickup Transducer 
The magnetic speed pickup transducer is usually referred to as a magnetic speed pickup and is the most common type of speed sensor found in gas turbine propulsion plants. It is used for sensing gas turbine speed on the LM2500 and the Allison 501-K17. It is also used to measure reduction gear speed for controllable pitch &lt;em&gt;propeller&lt;/em&gt; (CPP) systems on the FFG-7 class ships. The MRGs of the DD-963 class ships use magnetic speed pickups for sensing clutch engagement speeds. 
Magnetic speed pickups sense speed by using a toothed gear that cuts the magnetic field of the pickup. The output of the sensor is a square-wave ac voltage. This voltage is converted to a proportional dc voltage in a signal conditioner. 
Example 1: How to Calculate the Speed of an Object 
The procedure to show how to calculate the speed of an object is straightforward. In simple problems, distance and time are given, and one only needs to execute their division. 
Calculate the speed of a car that crosses a 200-meter bridge in 10 seconds. 
Solution: 
𝑆=𝑑𝑡=200𝑚10𝑠=20𝑚/𝑠 
In some situations, the formula can be used to find: 
Distance: when speed and time values are given, the formula can be applied as 𝑑&lt;em&gt;=&lt;/em&gt;𝑆∗𝑡&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
Time: when speed and distance are given, the formula can be applied as 𝑡&lt;em&gt;=&lt;/em&gt;𝑑𝑆&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;

 &lt;image source="images/internal_gear.png" width="50%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
In an internal gear system, the teeth of one gear project outwards , but the teeth of the other gear project inwards toward the center of the gear as shown in &lt;xref ref="internal_gear_png"/&gt;. One gear stands inside the other in the internal gear pump. A gear directly attached to the drive shaft of the pump is set off-center in a circular chamber fitted around its circumference with the spurs of an internal gear. The two gears mesh on one side of the pump chamber, between the suction and discharge. On the opposite side of the chamber a crescent shaped form (a stationary part of the pump) stands in the space between the two gears in such a way as to provide a close clearance with them. 
The rotation of the central gear by the shaft causes the outside gear to rotate, since the two are in mesh. Everything in the chamber rotates except the crescent, causing the liquid to be trapped in the gear spaces as they pass the crescent. This liquid is carried from the suction to the discharge, where it is forced out of the pump by the re-meshing of the gear teeth. As liquid is carried away from the suction side of the pump, the pressure is lowered and more liquid is drawn in. 
The direction of flow through this type of pump can be reversed by rotating the crescent (and the pump cover it is attached to) 180 degrees.

            <Text>A pump circulates deionized water. Optionally, a second pump can be implemented for redundancy and changeover. Water flow monitoring is implemented in order to check that the minimum flow required to cool the power parts is maintained. An alarm / fault signal is sent to the controller in case of insufficient flow. Water conductivity measurement enables to control the water deionization system valve with a hysteresis type command: above a high conductivity value, the valve is opened so that water flows through a DI resin cartridge. Water conductivity decreases until the low level value is reached, at which the valve is closed. If the water conductivity is higher than a maximum value a fault status is sent to the controller upon which the drive will be tripped. 
An expansion tank is used to set static pressure of water circuit, and mitigate pressure variations due to water expansion due to temperature. A raw water / deionized water heat exchanger is used for transferring heat from inverter heat sinks to raw water. Deionized water outlet temperature of cooling unit is monitored, with an alarm / fault managed by the controller.

            <Title>Timing Gears, Camshaft, and Valve Mechanism</Title>
            <Text>In order for a diesel engine to operate, all of its components must perform their functions at very precise intervals in relation to the motion of the piston. To accomplish this, a component called a camshaft is used. Figure 9 illustrates a camshaft and camshaft drive gear. Figure 2 and Figure 3 illustrate the location of a camshaft in a large overhead cam diesel engine. A camshaft is a long bar with egg-shaped eccentric lobes, one lobe for each valve and fuel injector (discussed later). Each lobe has a follower as shown on Figure 10. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt; 9 Camshaft and Drive Gear &lt;/caption&gt; 
  &lt;image source="images/diesel-image36.png" width="50%"/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
As the camshaft is rotated, the follower is forced up and down as it follows the profile of the cam lobe. The followers are connected to the engine's valves and fuel injectors through various types of linkages called pushrods and rocker arms. The pushrods and rocker arms transfer the reciprocating motion generated by the camshaft lobes to the valves and injectors, opening and closing them as needed. The valves are maintained closed by springs. 
As the valve is opened by the camshaft, it compresses the valve spring. The energy stored in the valve spring is then used to close the valve as the camshaft lobe rotates out from under the follower. Because an engine experiences fairly large changes in temperature (e.g., ambient to a normal running temperature of about 190 F), its components must be designed to allow for thermal expansion. Therefore, the valves, valve pushrods, and rocker arms must have some method of allowing for the expansion. This is accomplished by the use of valve lash. Valve lash is the term given to the "slop" or "give" in the valve train before the cam actually starts to open the valve. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt; 10 Diesel Engine Valve Train &lt;/caption&gt; 
  &lt;image source="images/diesel-image37.png" width="50%"/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
The camshaft is driven by the engine's crankshaft through a series of gears called idler gears and timing gears. The gears allow the rotation of the camshaft to correspond or be in time with, the rotation of the crankshaft and thereby allows the valve opening, valve closing, and injection of fuel to be timed to occur at precise intervals in the piston's travel. To increase the flexibility in timing the valve opening, valve closing, and injection of fuel, and to increase power or to reduce cost, an engine may have one or more camshafts. Typically, in a medium to large V-type engine, each bank will have one or more camshafts per head. In the larger engines, the intake valves, exhaust valves, and fuel injectors may share a common camshaft or have independent camshafts. 
Depending on the type and make of the engine, the location of the camshaft or shafts varies. The camshaft(s) in an in-line engine is usually found either in the head of the engine or in the top of the block running down one side of the cylinder bank. Figure 10 provides an example of an engine with the camshaft located on the side of the engine. Figure 3 provides an example of an overhead cam arrangement as on a V-type engine. On small or mid-sized V-type engines, the camshaft is usually located in the block at the center of the "V" between the two banks of cylinders. In larger or multi-cam shafted V- type engines, the camshafts are usually located in the heads.</Text>

            <Title>Flywheel</Title>
            <Text>The flywheel is located on one end of the crankshaft and serves three purposes. First, through its inertia, it reduces vibration by smoothing out the power stroke as each cylinder fires. Second, it is the mounting surface used to bolt the engine up to its load. Third, on some diesels, the flywheel has gear teeth around its perimeter that allow the starting motors to engage and crank the diesel.</Text>

            <Title>Practice Safe Lifting Techniques</Title>
            <Text>To lift heavy objects safely, follow these guidelines:
Assess the object's weight and plan your lift accordingly. Warm up your muscles with light exercises. Stand close to the object with feet shoulder-width apart, keeping your back straight and bending at the knees. Get a firm grip on the object and lift using the strength of your legs, not your back. Avoid twisting and keep the object close to your body. 
Don’t hesitate to ask for help if you need it. Prioritize safety and listen to your body to prevent injuries.</Text>

            <Title>Example</Title>
            <Text>Using unit-factor method we can express a distance in meters from feet as:
To Find distance in meters = (distance in ft) \times  (12 in/1 ft) \times (2.54 cm/1 in) \times (1 m/100 cm)
The Conversion factor is .3048 m/ft
distance in meters = (distance in ft) x 0.3048 m/ft
1 foot = 12”/1 ft \times 2.54 cm/1” = 30.48 cm/ft
1 foot = 1 M/100 cm \times 30.48 cm = 0.3048 Meters 
Conversion Factor = .3048

1 meter =1ft/12 in \times 1 in/2.54 cm \times 100 cm/1 m=100 /30.48
1 meter = 100/30 =3.28 ft
Conversion Factor
1 foot = 0.3048 m
1 inch = 2.54 cm
Nautical Miles
1 Statute Mile= 1 Statute Mile/5280 ft x 6076 ft/1 NM = 1.15 Mile/NM
Conversion Factor = 1.15 mile/NM

1 km =1.852 NM</Text>

            <Text>To control an engine means to keep it running at a desired speed, either in accordance with, or regardless of, the changes in the load carried by the engine. The degree of control required depends upon two factors: the engine's performance characteristics, and the type of load which it drives.
Control of a diesel engine is accomplished through several components: the camshaft, the fuel injector pump, fuel injector and the governor. The camshaft provides the timing needed to properly inject the fuel, the fuel injector pump provides the components that meters and injects the fuel, and the governor regulates the amount of fuel that the injector is to inject. Together, these three major components ensure that the engine runs at the desired speed.
In diesel engines, a varying amount of fuel is mixed with a constant amount of compressed air inside the cylinder. A full charge of air enters the cylinder during each intake event. The amount of fuel injected into the cylinders controls combustion and thus determines the speed and power output of a diesel engine. 
A governor is provided to regulate the flow of fuel.  Other devices, either integral with the governor or mounted separately on the engine, are used to control overspeed or overload.</Text>

When propulsion power is supplied electrically, speed reduction is accomplished by selecting the appropriate number of poles in the generator and varying the electrical frequency supplied to the motor. This setup allows each component to operate within its most efficient range, maximizing overall energy efficiency and reducing fuel consumption.</Text>

            <Text>&gt;*Oil temperature leaving babbitted bearings should never exceed 180 °F, nor should it ever rise more than a 50 °F across the bearing.   Action must be taken before these limits are reached.*

The temperature guidelines stated above are recognized by the US Navy [079-46.8.11.3][#NSTM] and on US Coast Guard license exam [Questions 7018, 7475][#MEWB5], however the DeLaval instruction manual for the main engine aboard the *Kennedy* is more conservative, stating that 

&gt; *An inlet oil temperature of 110 °F to 120 °F should be maintained. The maximum temperature rise of the oil passing through any bearing should not exceed 40 °F. The discharge temperature of oil leaving any bearing should not exceed 160 °F. Oil pressure of at least 4-5 psi at the most remote bearing is required.* [p. 5-1][#TurbineManual]

Aboard the *Kennedy*, lube oil is delivered to the bearings at 110-120 °F and exits with a temperature of 125-160 °F depending on load.  Oil leaving the lube oil cooler should never exceed 130 °F.</Text>

            <Title>Heat Transfer</Title>
            <Text>Heat can flow from one substance to another only when a temperature difference exists. Heat flow can occur only from a higher temperature to a lower temperature. When two objects at different temperatures are placed in contact with each other (or near each other), heat flows from the warmer object to the cooler one until both are at the same temperature. Heat transfer occurs at a faster rate when there is a larger temperature difference between the two objects. As the temperature difference approaches zero, the rate of heat transfer approaches zero. 
Conduction, radiation, and convection are usually considered to be the three methods by which heat transfer can occur. It is more accurate, however, to consider conduction and radiation as the two basic methods of heat transfer and to consider convection separately as a special process which involves movement within a mass of fluid.

            <Title>Loss of feed pressure</Title>
            <Text>Loss of feed pressure can lead to a low water casualty if not rectified, so it must be attended to quickly. The symptoms are low pressure on the feed pump discharge gage, and a gradual or sudden drop in the steam drum level. Also as the drum level falls, the feedwater regulator will open wide as it tries to compensate.

Low feed pump discharge pressure can be caused by three different, possibly related, causes.

The first is outright failure of the feed pump or governor.  In this case, there will not be enough water delivered to the boiler to meet the demand. However, steam will continue to leave the boiler and the condensate pump will continue move it to the DC heater, so the steam drum level will fall, and the DC heater level will rise as a result.

The second, more common cause, is loss of suction at the feed pump.  If the DC heater is allowed to go dangerously low, either by inattentive watchstanding, or by failure of the automatic make-up feed regulator, the feed pump will have nothing to pump.  This, obviously, should be avoided.

The feed pump will also lose suction if it becomes vapor bound.  The feed pump is designed to pump water; it won't pump when there is vapor at the suction, and may actually overspeed and trip out.  Since feedwater in the DC heater is at saturation temperature, it will flash to steam (vapor) when its pressure is reduced even slightly.  The DC heater is located high in the engineroom to provide enough static head to prevent this flashing.  However, when the DC heater level is low, the static head is reduced and flashing may occur.  Flashing may also occur if the pressure in the DC heater suddenly drops lower than normal. This can be caused by introducing large quantities of cold make-up water into the DC heater, condensing the steam there, or by a sudden drop in the auxiliary exhaust pressure.  A noisy or racing feed pump, low suction pressure, and fluctuating discharge pressures are signs of vapor binding. Additionally, at low loads the recirc valve needs to be open to prevent overheating of water and flashing to vapor at the suction eye. 

The third is as load increases on the boiler and more water is needed in the boiler the recirc valve needs to be closed. At even higher loads the feed pump nozzle needs to be opened.</Text>

            <Title>Current</Title>
            <Text>Current refers to the flow of electric charge in an electrical circuit. It is the rate at which electric charges, typically electrons, move through a conductor. Electrons, which are negatively charged particles, are the primary carriers of electric charge in most conductive materials.
Current can be initiated and sustained in a number of ways, including&lt;ul&gt;
Chemical reaction &lt;p&gt;Batteries and fuel cells use this principle.&lt;/p&gt;
Electromagnetic induction &lt;p&gt;whereby mechanical power supplied by a prime mover is converted to electrical power by means of a changing magnetic field   This is the principle used by electrical generators.&lt;/p&gt;
Photovoltaic effect   &lt;p&gt;When sunlight strikes the surface of a solar cell, photons are absorbed by the semiconductor material used in the cell which causes some electrons  break free from their normal positions, creating a charge imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;
Seebeck effect &lt;p&gt;The Seebeck effect is a phenomenon where a  small current is produced between two different types of metals or semiconductor materials when  a temperature difference exists between them.  Thermocouples use this principle to produce electric signals for temperature measurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Current is measured in amperes (A) and is represented by the symbol I. It can be thought of as the quantity of charge passing through a point in a circuit per unit of time, or alternately as the rate of charge flow. 
The ampere, or amp (unit symbol: A) is the unit of electrical current.  One ampere is equal to one coulomb of charge moving past a point in one second.
Consider the battery shown in &lt;xref ref="fig_battery"/&gt;.  The chemical reaction inside the battery causes electrons to move from the positive terminal to the negative terminal, making the negative terminal more negative and the positive terminal more positive.  This creates a potential difference, or voltage across the battery terminals.  
When the switch is closed, excess electrons will naturally be attracted to the positive terminal and they will migrate through the wire  to attempt to equalize the charge.  This create a flow of electrons that will continue until the chemical reaction is depleted and the battery &lt;q&gt;dies&lt;/q&gt;.
&lt;figure xml:id="fig_battery" &gt;
&lt;caption&gt;  The battery creates a voltage to drive current through a circuit.  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;image width="60%" source="images/battery.png"&gt;

&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Whenever a potential difference exists between two points in a circuit, whether created by a battery, a generator, or some other voltage source, it will drive electrons from the more negative point towards the more positive point.  This is called electron flow, or electron current.
Sadly, electron current is not technically current!  Current is defined as a stream of charge that flows from a more positively charged area to a more negatively charged area.  This definition was adopted because we want to think of current as a flow going from a higher level (more positive) to a lower level (less positive), like water flowing down hill.  Unfortunately, in 1752, before the nature of electric charge and electrons was fully understood,  Benjamin Franklin unknowingly defined the charge on an electron as negative,  so the direction of conventional current is exactly opposite to electron flow.
&lt;image source="images/urgent_mission.png" width="40%"&gt;&lt;remix&gt;

&lt;/remix&gt;&lt;/image&gt;
This definition of current, sometimes called conventional current for clarity, is the one used by physicists, engineers, and in textbooks.  You should think of current as positive charge flowing from a positive terminal to a negative terminal, even though, in reality, negatively charged electrons flow in the other direction.

            <Title>Area</Title>
            <Text>In mathematics and geometry, area refers to the measure of the amount of space within the boundary of a two-dimensional object. It is usually expressed in square units, such as square meters or square feet. The concept of area is used to quantify the extent or size of a flat surface. It quantifies the amount of space enclosed by a shape. 
For example, if you have a rectangle with a length of &lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt; units and a width of &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt; units, the area (&lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;) of the rectangle is given by the formula: 
   &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;=&lt;em&gt;L&lt;/em&gt;×&lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt;
In the example shown, the area of the square is 12 square units because 12-unit squares are needed to cover the surface enclosed by the square. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Area Units&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image14.jpeg"/&gt;
   Picture 117
&lt;/figure&gt;
The perimeter is defined as a measure of the length of the border that surrounds a closed geometric figure. The term perimeter derivates from the Greek words, ‘Peri’ and ‘meter’ which mean ‘around’ and ‘measure.’ In geometry, perimeter refers to the continuous line forming the path outside the two-dimensional shape. The area of a two-dimensional figure is defined as the amount of space inside the boundaries of the figure. It is a physical quantity that indicates the number of square units occupied by the two-dimensional object. 
6.4.2 Units for Measuring Area in Metric and US Standard 
Common units for measuring area include square meters, square feet, square kilometers, and acres, depending on the context and the scale of the area being measured. When working with area measurements, it's important to use the appropriate units based on the scale of the area being measured. For example, when designing a building, square footage is measured rather than square inches. 
US Standard System 
In the US standard system, area is typically measured in square feet (ft²) or square inches (in²). To calculate the area of a rectangular or square surface, you multiply the length of one side by the length of the other side. 
For example, the area of a rectangle with a length of 10 feet and a width of 5 feet is calculated as follows: Area = Length × Width Area = 10 ft × 5 ft = 50 ft², the conversion between two square units is the square of the conversion between the corresponding length units. 
1 foot = 12 inches, the relationship between square feet and square inches is: 
1 square foot = 144 square inches, where {144in}^{2}= 12 in × 12in. 
Similarly, 1 square yard = 9 square feet,{9ft}^{2}
1 square mile = 3,097,600 square yards = 27,878,400 square feet 
In addition, conversion factors include: 
1 inch = 2.54 cm 
   \frac{{1inch}^{2}}{{2.54cm}^{2}}= \frac{{1in}^{2}}{{6.4516cm}^{2}}
1 square inch = 6.4516 square centimeters 
1 square foot = 0.09290304 square meters 
1 square yard = 0.83612736 square meters 
1 square mile = 2.589988110336 square kilometers 
The acre is also commonly used to measure land areas, where: 
1 acre = 43,560 square feet = 4,840 square yards 
An acre is approximately 40% of a hectare 
Metric System 
In the metric system, area is measured in square meters (m²) or square centimeters (cm²). The formula for calculating the area of a rectangular or square surface remains the same, but the measurements are in metric units. 
For instance, if you have a rectangular surface with a length of 8 meters and a width of 3 meters: Area = Length × Width Area = 8 m × 3 m = 24 m² 
Here are some common metric units for measuring area: 
Square Millimeter (mm²): The square millimeter is an even smaller unit used for very small areas, often in microscopic or engineering applications. 
Square Centimeter (cm²): The square centimeter is a smaller unit used for measuring smaller areas, especially in scientific contexts. 
Square Meter (m²): The square meter is the base unit for area in the metric system. It is the area of a square with sides of one meter. 
Square Kilometer (km²): The square kilometer is a larger unit of area often used for measuring large land areas, countries, or continents. One square kilometer is equal to 1,000,000 square meters. 
Hectare (ha): The hectare is commonly used for measuring land areas, especially in agriculture and forestry. One hectare is equal to 10,000 square meters or 0.01 square kilometers. 
These units are part of the International System of Units (SI) and provide a standardized way to express measurements of area in the metric system. 
6.4.3 Instruments Used to Measure Area 
Several instruments are used to measure area, depending on the context and the precision required. Here are some of them: 
Rulers or Tape Measures are commonly used for measuring the lengths of sides of a shape, which can then be used to calculate the area of simple geometric shapes like rectangles and squares. 
&lt;figure&gt;

Planimeter is a mechanical device used to measure the area of irregular shapes on a map or plan. It works by tracing the outline of the shape, and the device calculates the area based on the movement of its components. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Planimeter&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image17.jpeg"/&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
A Measuring Wheel, also known as a surveyor's wheel, is a tool used to measure long distances on the ground. By rolling the wheel along a path, it records the number of rotations, which can then be used to calculate the area of a given area. Also known as a "measuring wheel" or "click wheel," surveyor's wheels are used to measure longer distances, such as those encountered in land surveying. They are often used for irregularly shaped areas. 
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Total Stations are electronic devices used in surveying and construction to measure distances and angles. They can also be used to calculate the area of land parcels by taking multiple measurements and applying mathematical algorithms.

Navigation Charts are one of the most fundamental tools available to the mariner. A navigation chart is a map that depicts the configuration of the shoreline and seafloor. It provides water depths, locations of dangers to navigation, locations and characteristics of aids to navigation, anchorages, and other features. 
A Navigation Chart Scale is an essential tool for mariners, indicating coastlines, depths, and navigational hazards. The scale of a navigation chart relates distance on the chart to distance in the real world. For example, a scale of 1:50,000 means that one unit of length on the chart (e.g., 1 inch) represents 50,000 units of the same length in the real world (e.g., 50,000 inches or approximately 0.8 nautical miles). 
The navigation chart is essential for safe navigation. Mariners use charts to plan voyages and navigate ships safely and economically. Federal regulations require most commercial vessels to carry electronic or paper navigation charts while they transit U.S. waters. 
Since the mid-1830s, the U.S. Coast Survey (a NOAA predecessor agency) has been the nation’s navigation chart maker. NOAA's Office of Coast Survey is still responsible for creating and maintaining all charts of U.S. coastal waters, the Great Lakes, and waters surrounding U.S. territories.

These are just a few examples of instruments and technologies used to measure area, each suited to different applications and levels of precision. 
6.4.4 Area in Math 
There are several well-known formulas for the areas of simple shapes such as triangles, rectangles, and circles. Using these formulas, the area of any polygon can be found by dividing the polygon into triangles. For shapes with a curved boundary, calculus is usually required to compute the area. Indeed, the problem of determining the area of plane figures was a major motivation for the historical development of calculus. 
Mathematics provides various formulas and methods to find the area of different shapes and surfaces. Here are some common mathematical approaches: 
Geometric Formulas: For basic shapes like rectangles, squares, triangles, circles, and polygons, there are well-known formulas to calculate their areas. For instance: 
Area of a square: 
To calculate the area of a square, multiply the length of one side by the other (equal length sides). 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Area = a2&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image25.png"/&gt;
   Picture 116
&lt;/figure&gt;
a = length of side 
Area of a rectangle: 
To calculate the area of a rectangle, multiply the width by the height. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Area = w × h&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image26.png"/&gt;
   Picture 115
&lt;/figure&gt;
w = width 
h = height 
Area of Triangle: 
To calculate the area of a triangle, multiply \frac{1}{2} the base times the height. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Area = ½ × b × h&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image27.png"/&gt;
   Picture 114
&lt;/figure&gt;
b = base 
h = vertical height 
Area of Circle: 
To calculate the area of a circle, multiply the radius squared by π=3,.14. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Area = π × r2&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image28.png"/&gt;
   Picture 113
&lt;/figure&gt;
r = radius 
Integration: For irregular shapes or curves, calculus can be used. By integrating appropriate functions over a given interval, you can find the area under a curve or between curves. This method is particularly useful for finding the area of regions bounded by curves in the Cartesian coordinate system. 
Dissection and Composition: This method involves decomposing complex shapes into simpler shapes whose areas are known. For example, a complex shape might be divided into rectangles, triangles, circles, etc., and then the areas of these simpler shapes are calculated individually and summed up to find the total area. 
Coordinate Geometry: In the Cartesian coordinate system, the area of a polygon can be calculated using the shoelace formula or by dividing the polygon into triangles and summing their areas. 
Vector Calculus: In three-dimensional space, vector calculus can be used to find the area of surfaces. For example, the surface area of a parametrically defined surface can be found using a surface integral. 
Limit Process: The area of a shape can also be approximated using a limit process, where you divide the shape into smaller and smaller pieces and sum their areas. As the size of the pieces approaches zero, the sum converges to the exact area of the shape. 
These are just a few examples of how mathematics can be used to find area, and there are many other techniques and methods depending on the specific shape or surface being considered.

            <Title>Ground</Title>
            <Text>Ground in electricity has several meanings depending on the context in which it's used. Ground primarily means the earth when ashore, or the hull aboard ship.   
Circuits are grounded by connecting them to ground. This ground connection provides an alternate path for electrical currents to flow back to the source. Ashore, electrical circuits are grounded by connecting them electrically to a rod or pipe driven into the earth, while aboard ship, a connection the hull serves the same purpose.    A chassis ground, refers to the point on the metal frame or outer casing (chassis) of an electrical or electronic device where the circuit is grounded.  The chassis itself is grounded to the earth or the hull. Ground also refers to a reference point used for voltage measurements.  Finally a ground or ground fault can refer to an accidental connection between the circuit and ground 
The ground connection serves several important functions:  &lt;ul&gt;
Reference Point Voltage is always measured relative to a reference point. By defining a specific point as "ground," voltages at other points in the circuit are measured with respect to this reference.  
Safety Grounding is crucial for safety in electrical systems. In case of a fault or short circuit, excess current can flow to the ground, allowing circuit protection devices like fuses and circuit breakers to quickly interrupt the current flow. This helps prevent electrical fires, shocks, and damage to equipment.
Human Safety In the event of a fault that causes a live conductor to come into contact with a conductive surface (like a metal enclosure), the ground connection provides an alternate path for current to flow around, rather than through the victim, reducing the severity of electric shock.
Shielding In electronic devices and systems, grounding is used for shielding against electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI). Metal enclosures and components can be connected to the ground to create a shield that prevents external electromagnetic signals from interfering with the device's operation.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <Title>Transistors and ICs</Title>
            <Text>A transistor is a semiconductor device that acts as an electronic switch or amplifier. It can control the flow of electric current between its two main terminals, known as the collector and emitter, by using a small current at its third terminal, called the base.  Transistors are used for amplification and switching purposes.and are the building blocks of modern electronics.
The most common variety of transistor is the bipolar junction transistor (BJT), which has two variations: NPN and PNP.  In an NPN transistor, current flows from the emitter to the collector when a small current is applied to the base. A PNP transistor is the opposite of an NPN transistor.  In a PNP transistor, current flows from the collector to the emitter when a small current is applied to the base.

An integrated circuit (IC), also known as a microchip or chip, is a compact electronic device that contains a large number of interconnected electronic components, such as transistors, resistors, capacitors, and diodes, all fabricated on a single piece of semiconductor material. ICs are the building blocks of modern electronics, found in everything from microprocessors to memory chips.

Circuit breakers are electromechanical devices that to swiftly interrupt current flow under short circuit and overload conditions.
Short circuits protection is provided by the instantaneous trip mechanism. It relies on the electromagnetic force generated by the excessive current passing through a solenoid coil. The large magnetic field generated by the high current causes the solenoid to rapidly trigger a trip mechanism and open the circuit breaker's contacts almost instantly. 
The overload trip mechanism detects sustained high currents caused by excessive load or faulty equipment, but permits the temporary overloads that occur when a motor starts. The load current passes through a bimetallic strip or a heating element. If the current increases, the temperature of the bimetallic strip rises, causing it to bend. When the bending reaches a critical point, it triggers the trip mechanism, opening the circuit breaker contacts and cutting off the current.
Fuses  are thin wires or elements designed to melt and break the circuit when excessive current flows through them. Like circuit breakers, they provide protection against overcurrents and short circuits but need to be replaced after they "blow."
Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs) monitor current imbalances, and swiftly shut off power if a ground fault is detected, protecting people against electric shocks.

            <Title>Gauge pressure (psig)</Title>
            <Text>Since the absolute atmospheric pressure is always present, and acts on everything equally, we normally don’ even notice it. Pressures are usually measured up or down from atmospheric pressure, and an ordinary pressure gauge reads zero when it is subjected to atmospheric pressure only. Pressures measured in this way are called gauge pressure. It is important to distinguish between gauge pressure and the absolute pressure described in the next section. 
Gauge pressures start at zero and increase with positive values with the range dependent on what system application is being measured. 
Vacuum Gages also start at zero and increase with negative values with the greatest value of vacuum being 29.92 inHg. 
We sometimes say psig to indicate gauge pressure and other times we merely say psi. By common convention, gauge pressure is always assumed when pressure is given in pounds per square inch, pounds per square foot, or similar units. The “g” (for gauge) is added only when there is some possibility of confusion. Absolute pressure, on the other hand, is always expressed as pounds per square inch absolute (psia), and so forth. It is always necessary to establish clearly just what kind of pressure we are talking about, unless this is very clear from the nature of the discussion.

            <Text>Dc link voltage (Excitation voltage) 
The DC Link Voltage is internally measured from rectified voltage of excitation input power. This signal is used for protective function and monitoring purpose. The monitored excitation voltage of the HDCM software is not value directly measured from excitation output terminal but calculated from dc link voltage by using PWM duty and voltage drop of power module (IGBT). 
Excitation current 
This signal is internally measured from output current of power module (IGBT) by using of current sensor installed in HDEC2000 unit. This signal is used for the excitation current control, over excitation limitation, protective functions and monitoring purpose. 
Excitation power 
Three kinds of Excitation input power source (Shunt power, PMG power and External utility) are available. Three phase ac. source, single phase ac. source, or dc power source is usable and the permissible maximum voltage is 260Vac or 360Vdc. The input power is rectified and smoothed by capacitor, and then supplied to excitation winding through the power module (IGBT). 
The current ratings of excitation input power source and all other components carrying excitation current are not calculated from the power rating of HDEC2000 unit, but should be determined from design data of the generator. 
If the excitation input voltage is much higher than the excitation requirement, the dynamic response is improved but control accuracy or stability may be reduced. On the other hand if the margin of excitation input voltage is a little bit higher than excitation requirement, the control accuracy or stability may be improved, but the dynamic response may be very poor. The balance between dynamic response and control accuracy is the first consideration in the designation of excitation system (input power). See Appendix C (Specification) for more information. 
Control power 
HDEC2000 unit does not require the external control power for the most of application. In case of external control power is supplied depending on application, some consideration may be made. For more information, see Voltage Buildup function of this section, section 2 (Installation and Hardware) and Appendix C (Specification). 
Digital (Relay) Output 
HDEC2000 unit provides three programmable output relays and one watchdog relay. The output relays are controlled by DSP (digital signal processor) and the power rating is 250Vac, 10A. Even though the current rating of relays is 10A, we strongly recommend that the output relay be used with the control purpose only for the robustness of overall excitation system. 
If the output relay is connected with reactive load (ex: relay coil) in dc circuit, the load should have freewheeling diode across the load terminals, or the freewheeling diode should be installed externally to protect the circuit against switching arc. 
Programmable Output relay #1 to #3 
The output relay#1 to #3 can be assigned for any functions (or events) listed below. When the assigned function or event is activated, the output relay is also energized and latched (if assigned for fault event). The logic of each relay contact can be configured with normally opened (NO) or normally closed (NC). 
More than one function can be assigned simultaneously for one relay. In this case, the logical combination (combined with OR logic) determines whether the output relay is energized or not. Assignable fault events (or functions) are listed below: 
		 generator over voltage  
		 generatorundervoltage  
		 generatorovercurrent  
		 excitationovercurrent

		 UELstatus  
		 SCLstatus  
		 UFL(V/Flimiter)status  Watchdog relay  Watchdog process detects the abnormal software execution. The watchdog process energizes the watchdog  
relay when the abnormal software execution is detected, and then its output contact will be closed. The logic of watchdog relay is normally open. Also, if the abnormal software execution is detected, the excitation power output is shut downed by HDEC2000 unit to prevent the damages of the generator, system and the HDEC2000 unit. 
In case of critical application, we recommend that the excitation power input be disconnected for overall system protection if watchdog relay contact is closed 
Peripheral Device Communication and User interface 
The communication ports consist of RS232 (COM0), CAN (COM1) and RS485 (COM2) ports. For more information about communication, see section 4 (Configuration) and separated MODBUS communication manual. For Information about User interface, see section 5 (User Interface). 
Memory usage and configuration 
Three types of memories (Flash memory, RAM and EEPROM) are internally used for HDEC2000 unit operation. EEPROM stores configuration parameters, and user can access (readable and writable) to this information via HDCM software. Executable control software code (firmware) is stored in the nonvolatile Flash memory integrated in the DSP. RAM is used for temporary data storage, and it is also integrated in the DSP. 
OPERATIONAL FUNCTION 
This section describes control modes, limitation functions and protective functions of HDEC2000 unit. The helpful technical information is also described for understanding the internal architecture of the unit. 
Regulation Mode and More 
Controller (Function block) and Control gain 
HDEC2000 unit has four regulation (operating) modes called FCR, AVR, VAR and PF mode. One regulation mode is selected depending on the combination of digital input(s) and configuration parameters. 
Each regulation functions are performed by its controller (sometimes called software function block) containing adjustable control gains, and each controller controls the target parameter such as voltage, excitation current, reactive power or power factor by using control gains. Thus, the control gain is one of the major parameters which determine the dynamic (or static) response or steady state stability of generator and excitation system. 
Four major control gains are used for each controller. Some controller has all four control gains or more and other controller has only two control gains. The simplified description of each control gains are listed below 
LoopGainKG:scalinggain,determinestheoverallresponse 
ProportionalGainKP:Improvetransientresponse 
		 Integral Gain KI: improve steady state error and recovery speed  
		 Derivative Gain KD: Improve the steady state stability and initial response  For more detailed information about control gains tuning and controller structure, see section 4 (Configuration) and Appendix B (Mathematical Models).  FCR mode  FCR regulation mode controls the excitation current by setpoint. HDEC2000 unit measures the excitation current and compares it with commanded setpoint. And the unit controls the excitation current so that the excitation current be equal to [FCR Setpoint]. FCR controller is PI (proportional, integral) controller which has KG, KP, and KI. In the FCR mode, over excitation limiter, stator current limiter, under-excitation limiter and the under frequency limiter are not enabled.  FCR mode is normally used for commissioning or selected for the application which requires manual control like test bench system.  AVR mode  AVR regulation mode controls the generator voltage by setpoint. HDEC2000 unit measures the generator voltage and compares it with commanded setpoint. And the unit controls the excitation current so that the generator voltage be equal to [AVR Setpoint]. AVR controller is PID (proportional, integral, derivative) controller which has KG, KP, KI and KD.  In case of the medium or small size generator which is connected with related big power grid (not island grid) or in case of synchronous motor application, the AVR mode cannot be selected. In which case, the VAR mode or the PF mode is preferred.  VAR mode  VAR regulation mode controls the reactive power by setpoint. The HDEC2000 unit measures the reactive power and compares it with commanded setpoint. And the unit controls the excitation current so that the reactive power be equal to [VAR Setpoint]. VAR controller is PI (proportional, integral) controller which has KG, KI.  VAR control mode is only prepared in case of small or medium generator which is connected with related big power grid (not island grid) or in case of synchronous motor application.  PF mode  PF regulation mode controls the power factor by setpoint. The HDEC2000 unit measures the power factor and compares it with commanded setpoint. And the unit controls the excitation current so that the power factor be equal to [PF Setpoint]. PF controller is PI (proportional, integral) controller which has KG, KI  PF control mode is only prepared in case of small or medium generator which is connected with related big power grid (not island grid) or in case of synchronous motor application.

This is the final effort to improve the efficiency of the steam cycle, by recovering heat energy that would otherwise be lost.
After leaving the economizer the feedwater enters the steam drum where the generation stage occurs, where the steam cycle begins again.

&lt;/sidebyside&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Cylinder heads performs several functions. First, they provide the top seal for the cylinder bore or sleeve. Second, they provide the structure to hold the exhaust valves (and intake valves where applicable), the fuel injector, and necessary linkages. 
Diesel engines have two methods of admitting and exhausting gases from the cylinder. They can use either ports, valves, or a combination of both. Ports are slots in the cylinder walls located in the lower third of the cylinder liner. See &lt;xref ref="two-stroke-V-engine"/&gt; for examples of intake ports, and note their relative location with respect to the rest of the engine. When the piston travels below the level of the ports, the ports are "opened" and fresh air or exhaust gases are able to enter or leave, depending on the type of port. 
The ports are then "closed" when the piston travels back above the level of the ports. Valves (refer to &lt;xref ref="engine-valves-pic"/&gt;) are mechanically opened and closed to admit or exhaust the gases as needed. The valves are located in the head casting of the engine. The point at which the valve seals against the head is called the valve seat. Most medium-sized diesels have either intake ports and exhaust valves, or intake valves and exhaust valves.

            <Text>An electrical circuit is a complete loop or path that allows for the regulated flow of electric current to power devices and carry out different tasks. It consists of different elements like voltage sources, switches, and electrical loads that are interconnected through wires. Electrical loads refer to devices that consume electrical energy and convert it into another form like mechanical work, light, or heat.   Motors, light bulbs and heating elements are some common examples of electrical loads.  
Series Circuit: In a series circuit, the components are connected in a single path such that the same current flows through each component. The components are connected end-to-end, creating a sequential circuit. In a series circuit, the total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances, and the total voltage across the circuit is divided among the components. If one component fails or is disconnected, the entire circuit is broken, and the flow of current stops.

Parallel Circuit: In a parallel circuit, the components are connected in multiple paths, allowing the current to divide and flow through different branches simultaneously. Each component in a parallel circuit has the same voltage across it. The total current in the circuit is divided among the branches based on the resistance of each branch. If one component fails or is disconnected in a parallel circuit, the current can still flow through the remaining branches.

In summary, a series circuit has components connected in a single path with the same current flowing through each component, while a parallel circuit has components connected in multiple paths, allowing current to divide among the branches.

            <Title>Firing Order</Title>
            <Text>Firing order refers to the order in which each of the cylinders in a multi-cylinder engine fires (power stroke). For example, a four cylinder engine's firing order could be 1-4-3-2. This means that the number 1 cylinder fires, then the number 4 cylinder fires, then the number 3 cylinder fires, and so on. 
Engines are designed so that the power strokes are spaced uniformly, that is, each time the crankshaft rotates a certain number of degrees, one of the cylinders will go through a power stroke. This reduces vibration and allows the power generated by the engine to be applied to the load in a smoother fashion than if they were all to fire at once or in odd multiples.</Text>

            <Title>Force</Title>
            <Text>What is force? In simple terms, a force is a push or a pull. 
More precisely, a force is a vector quantity which tends to produce an acceleration of a body in the direction of its  application. This means that if you want a stationary object to move, you must apply a force  to it to get it going. If you want to keep it moving, you need to continuously apply a force  to it to overcome friction, which is itself a force. Forces can exist without motion too –  when an object is stationary it’s usually because there are many forces acting on it which  cancel each other out, leaving no net force acting on the object. Forces always occur in  pairs. A push on an object is always accompanied by an equal and opposite force acting on the  pusher. 
In the English system of units, force is measured in pounds, tons, or long tons. 
In the SI  system, force is measured in newtons (\N{})  or kilonewtons (\kN{}).  The newton is a derived unit, equal  to the product of mass and acceleration. &lt;me&gt;\N{} =  \mathrm{kg}\cdot  {\mathrm{m}}/{\mathrm{s}^2}&lt;/me&gt;
For estimation purposes, a newton is about a quarter of a pound.

How To Measure Pipe Nipple Length? (5 Types)
by Pip's Island Home
#
Are you doing a DIY plumbing project and wondering how pipe nipples are measured? Or perhaps you are a plumbing rookie curious how to measure pipe nipples?
Ordering the right size nipple is important in any successful plumbing installation. This small but crucial pipe fittings make all the difference in guaranteeing leakage-free low-pressure piping systems.
So, just how are pipe nipples measured? This is a common concern among plumbing newbies looking to understand pipe fitting dimensions.
Determining pipe nipple size is straightforward as you will find out in this guide. Read on for details on pipe nipples and how to measure the dimensions accurately when ordering these necessary fittings.
What Is A Pipe Nipple?
#

A pipe nipple is a fitting made from a short piece of pipe and typically comes with male threads on both ends. A nipple acts as an adapter, connecting two female threaded pipes or fittings.
Manufacturers make nipples by cutting pipes of a certain length and creating the specific end connections that make the nipple unique. Like pipe, nipples can be welded or seamless.
Nipples usually come in various lengths, but most are about 12”. Before discussing how pipe nipples are measured, let’s first look at the most common types of pipe nipples.
Most Common Types Of Pipe Nipples
1. Close Or Running Nipple
#

One of the most common pipe nipples is the close nipple, also known as a running nipple. With this type of nipple, the entire short pipe is threaded with male threads. So when you connect a pipe on either end of the nipple, you wouldn’t see the nipple threads. The pipes or fittings on both sides come close, hiding the pipe nipple underneath.
One disadvantage of a close nipple is that it can be difficult to unscrew from a pipe or fitting. If you want to unscrew the connection, you must grip one of the nipple’s threaded ends with a pipe wrench, which could damage the threads, requiring you to replace the nipple. A nipple wrench to grip the pipe or fitting’s interior can minimize thread damage.
2. Hexagonal Nipple
#

A pipe nipple has a small unthreaded space between the two threaded ends. You can place a wrench on the unthreaded space to grasp the nipple and avoid damaging the threads.
The middle unthreaded space in some nipples has a hexagonal pattern resembling a nut. The hexagonal pattern provides a superior grip compared to a smooth pipe nipple.
In some nipples, the unthreaded hexagonal space is slightly longer, making the threaded ends shorter. This type of nipple is known as a long hex.
3. Reducing Nipple
#

Sometimes, you may want to connect differently-sized pipes or fittings, i.e., one fitting or pipe may be larger than the other. In this case, it is best to use a reducing nipple, also known as an unequal nipple.
A reducing nipple has the usual male threads on both ends but with different diameters. One end takes a female pipe with a larger connection, while the other end connects to a smaller pipe or fitting.
Be careful when connecting a large pipe to a small one. The increased flow rate and pressure in the smaller fitting or pipe can cause a sudden and potentially dangerous outburst.
4. Hose Nipple
#

Another common type of nipple is the hose pipe nipple. As the name suggests, these nipples connect pipe to tubing.
On one end of the nipple is a male threaded connection, while the other end of the nipple has a hose barb. The barb is usually more or less the same size as the threaded end of the nipple.
5. Welding Nipple
#

Welding nipples have one threaded and another non-threaded end that resembles a normal pipe. This nipple is handy when connecting a piping system to welded fittings or pipes.
The unthreaded end has a greater surface area to take welded fittings, ensuring a strong connection. Connecting pipes/fittings to the threaded end is easier when the unthreaded end is securely connected to the welded fitting.
When ordering pipe nipples, you must know the type of nipple that best suits your plumbing installation. Aside from the length and type of pipe, you should also understand the end connections required for your piping installation.
These are the most common pipe nipple end connections:
	•	Plain both ends (PBE): This nipple features threadless ends. It connects a welded socket in piping.
	•	Threaded both ends (TBE): Many pipe nipples are threaded on both ends and help to connect female threaded pipe or fittings.
	•	Beveled both ends (BBE): This pipe nipple connects welded pipes or fittings. It features beveled ends on both sides of the nipple.
Other variations include threaded one end, plain one end, and beveled one end. Your choice will depend on the design and function of the piping system.
How To Measure Pipe Nipple Length?
#

When determining the right type of pipe nipple to buy, you must specify the following:
	•	Inner or outer diameter
	•	Pipe nipple length
	•	Preferred nipple material
	•	Type of end connection
How are pipe nipples measured in terms of length? The length of a pipe nipple is the overall pipe length from one end of the nipple to the other. This formula applies whether the pipe nipple is plain on both ends, threaded on both ends, plain on one end, and threaded on the other. You can easily determine the nipple length using a caliper or thread and tape measure.
When pipe/fitting is installed on a pipe nipple, you can determine the nipple length by subtracting the thread engagement of both ends of the nipple. The engagement is the length of pipe inserted into the nipple to achieve a snug, hand-fitted seal.
In cases where the female threaded fittings come close to each other such that the nipple doesn’t show, the close length is calculated as two times the thread engagement.
Use a nominal diameter conversion chart to determine the precise length of the pipe nipple in inches.
How Do You Determine Pipe Size?
#

In addition to learning how to measure pipe nipple size, you will also need to know how pipe size is measured. The upside is that determining pipe size is easy—all you need is the outside diameter for male threads and the inner diameter for female threads.
To measure the pipe size for pipe/fittings with male threads, follow these steps:
	1	Wrap a small string around the pipe
	2	Use a marker pen to indicate where the string touches
	3	Measure the string from the tip to the marked point using a tape measure or ruler. This is the pipe’s circumference.
	4	Obtain the diameter by dividing the circumference by 3.14
	5	Use the nominal diameter conversion chart to convert the diameter readings to the more accurate nominal diameter. The nominal diameter is the actual pipe size.
The steps to measure the pipe size of a female threaded pipe are as follows:
	1	Place a tape measure or ruler on the pipe’s opening to measure the inside diameter.
	2	Use the nominal diameter chart for pipe sizes to convert the inside diameter to the nominal diameter, which is the pipe’s actual size.
Tips For Measuring Metric Pipe Fittings
#

Pipe fittings, including pipe nipples with metric thread, are quite common. Metric threaded fittings are also classified as tapered because the threads narrow the further in you get.
If your pipe/fitting has metric threads, you should have the right thread measurements before ordering a pipe nipple that can take the metric threads.
So, how do you measure metric pipe fittings? Here’s a step-by-step guide:
Measure the thread pitch using a pair of calipers or a thread gauge. The thread pitch is measured in mm, and typically measures 1.0, 1.5. or 2.0, but you can find fittings with larger thread pitches.
Determine the interior diameter for female threaded fittings and the outside diameter for male threaded fittings. This is how pipe thread is measured. (See the guide above on how to determine pipe size).
Use a metric thread specification chart to identify a thread callout that will give you an estimate measure of the metric pipe fitting. A thread callout combines the pitch measurement, and fitting’s outside diameter.
Summary: How Are Pipe Nipples Measured?
Pipe nipples are important in ensuring secure and safe connections in piping systems. The right type and size nipple make a world of difference regarding the integrity of any plumbing system.
Understanding how pipe nipples are measured will help you choose the right fittings. The figures might initially seem confusing, especially since you’d have to convert internal and outside diameters to nominal ones.
But, with the right tools and a simple formula to follow, you should quickly learn how to measure pipe nipples and even determine pipe sizes. I hope this handy guide helps you get the hang of measuring pipe nipple length and size.</Text>

Pipe thread sizes are based on an inside diameter (ID) or flow size. For example, “1/2–14 NPT” identifies a pipe thread with a nominal inside diameter of 1/2 inch and 14 threads to the inch, made according to the NPT standard. If “LH” is added, the pipe has a left hand thread. The most commonglobal pipe thread forms are:
	▪	NPT: American Standard Pipe Taper Thread
	▪	NPSC: American Standard Straight Coupling Pipe Thread
	▪	NPTR: American Standard Taper Railing Pipe Thread
	▪	NPSM: American Standard Straight Mechanical Pipe Thread
	▪	NPSL: American Standard Straight Locknut Pipe Thread
	▪	NPTF: American Standard Pipe Thread Tapered (Dryseal)
	▪	BSPP: British Standard Pipe Thread Parallel
	▪	BSPT: British Standard Pipe Thread Tapered
Plastic injection molded thread forms are manufactured to ANSI B2.1 and SAE J476 standards.
The word “tapered” in several of the above names points to the big difference between many pipe threads and those on bolts and screws. Many pipe threads must make not only a mechanical joint but also a leakproof hydraulic seal. This is accomplished by the tapered thread form of the male matching the thread form of the female tapered thread and the use of pipe sealant to fill any voids between the two threads which could cause a spiral leak. The bottoms of the threads aren’t on a cylinder, but a cone; they taper. The taper is 1⁄16 inch per inch of length, which is the same as 3/4 inch in a foot.
Because of the taper, a pipe thread can only screw into a fitting a certain distance before it jams. The standard specifies this distance as the length of hand tight engagement, the distance the pipe thread can be screwed in by hand. It also specifies another distance – the effective thread, this is the length of the thread which makes the seal on a conventional machined pipe thread. For workers, instead of these distances, it is more convenient to know how many turns to make by hand and how many with a wrench. A simple rule of thumb for installing tapered pipe threads, both metal and plastic, is finger tight plus one to two turns with a wrench. Torque installation values can be determined per application, but due to the variations involved in pipe joints such as disimiliar materials of male and female threads, type of sealants used, and internal variations in product wall thickness, a standard torque specification cannot be generically applied.</Text>

            <Text>Pressure is the measure of a perpendicular force exerted per unit area on the boundaries of a substance (or system). It is caused by the collisions of the molecules of the substance with the boundaries of the system. As molecules hit the walls, they exert forces that try to push the walls outward. The forces resulting from all of these collisions cause the pressure exerted by a system on its surroundings. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Pressure acting on a body&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/pressure-on-body.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Pressure is directly proportional to force and inversely proportional to the area over which the force is applied. Increasing the force applied to a surface or decreasing the area increases the pressure. 
Mathematically, pressure is expressed as:  &lt;me&gt;Pressure = \frac{Force}{Area}&lt;/me&gt;</Text>

For example, in the construction of a ship there may be different contractors, some of whom use US standard measurement and others who use metric. Since the agreed upon system is metric, conversions are required to standardize all measurements.  
In this section we will demonstrate a flexible and reliable technique for making conversions from one set of units to another called the unit-factor method.

            <Title>US Standard Units</Title>
            <Text>In the US standard system, volume is typically measured in cubic feet (\ft{1}^3) or cubic inches (\inch{1}^3).  
The fluid ounce is commonly used for measuring small liquid volumes, especially for cooking. 1 fluid ounce is about 1.80 cubic inches.  The gallon is a larger unit of liquid volume, equal to 128 fluid ounces. 1 US gallon has a volume of 231 cubic inches. 
The volume of a barrel depends on the type of barrel, so a beer barrel,  a whiskey barrel, and an oil barrel are all different.  In the marine and petroleum industries, a barrel means an oil barrel (bbl).  The standard size for an oil barrel is 42 US gallons (approximately 159 liters).  Many liquid products are shipped in drums.  The most common sided drum can hold approximately 55 US gallons of liquid, which is roughly equivalent to 208 liters.

            <Title>Thermocouple</Title>
            <Text>A thermocouple is a device which measures temperature using the Seebeck effect.  In 1821, Thomas Seebeck discovered that a voltage will be generated in a wire loop made from two dissimilar conductors when two junctions are maintained at different temperatures. The Seebeck effect is used to measure temperature with great sensitivity and accuracy .
A thermocouple consists of two metal wires made of different materials, joined at one end to form a junction. The junction, called the hot junction, is placed where the high temperature is to be determined, while the other ends, called the cold junction,  are maintained at a lower, stable temperature. The voltage difference between the wires at the cold junction is used to determine the temperature at the hot junction.
Thermocouples are designated by letters and colors indicating the specific pairs of metals used.  The most common thermocouple types are J (black), K (yellow) and T (blue).  The choice of a thermocouple is based on the required  temperature range and accuracy.

            <Title>Induction motors</Title>
            <Text>A more common type of AC motor, widely used for driving pumps and fans, is the   &lt;term&gt;induction motor&lt;/term&gt;. In most induction motors the rotor is built up of laminated steel plates, into which are inserted a number of conductor &lt;term&gt;bars&lt;/term&gt;, connected at the ends by &lt;term&gt;end-connecting rings&lt;/term&gt; as shown in &lt;xref ref="fig_24_16_png"/&gt;. Without the core, the conductor bars and end-connecting rings would form a rotating cage-like structure, for which reason this type of motor is often called a   &lt;term&gt;squirrel-cage induction motor&lt;/term&gt;.
&lt;figure xml:id="fig_24_16_png"&gt;
 &lt;caption&gt;Squirrel-cage rotor for AC induction motor&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;image source="pics/electricity/24-16.png" width="75%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
If a squirrel-cage rotor is placed in the rotating magnetic field of an AC-motor stator, but is locked to prevent its rotation, then as the rotating magnetic field, produced by the stator, crosses the conductor bars it will induce a voltage in these bars, and therefore a current will circulate through the rotor, since the bars are connected together to form a complete circuit. The current in the bars of the rotor produces a magnetic field surrounding the bars, which causes the rotor to act as if it were a permanent magnet or electromagnet. If the rotor were then released it would rotate as any magnet would, and will accelerate towards the synchronous speed of the stator field. However, it will never reach synchronous speed because, if it did, the conductor bars of the rotor would no longer be crossed by the rotating magnetic field of the stator and no induced rotor current or rotor magnetism would result. Therefore, induction-motor rotors always run at a speed slightly less than the synchronous speed in order to induce a voltage and current in the rotor conductor bars. The difference from synchronous speed is called the &lt;term&gt;slip&lt;/term&gt; and is defined as follows:   &lt;me&gt; \text{% slip} = \frac{\text{synchronous speed} - \text{actual rotor   speed}}{\text{synchronous speed}} \times 100\%&lt;/me&gt;

As the torque on an induction motor increases, the rotor must slow down (slip must increase) so that sufficient current is induced in the conductor bars of the rotor to develop an induced magnetism strong enough to develop the necessary torque. However, it is important to note that the slip is not much more than five percent even at high torque, so that induction motors are almost constant-speed machines when supplied with constant-frequency line power.
As with synchronous motors, induction~motor stators can have multiple pairs of stator poles for different speed requirements, and that they can easily be reversed by interchanging two of the three line connections.

            <Text>If a salinity alarm goes off, check the salinity alarm panel to locate the source of the contamination,  and then secure the affected equipment quickly to minimize contamination of the condensate system and the boiler.  A chloride test may be used to verify the salinity alarm.

In the mean time, both boilers should be tested and placed on continuous blowdown and treated to restore water quality.  Until the water chemistry recovers, the boiler firing rate should be reduced to prevent priming and carryover.  In severe cases, the boiler may have to be secured and drained.

After the situation has been stabilized, the source of the contamination can be repaired. Leaking heat exchangers can be taken out of service and repaired by plugging leaking tubes.  If the source is a salty distilled water tank, it should be dumped overboard and refilled with clean distillate.</Text>

   &lt;caption&gt;Butterfly Valve&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image source="images/Butterfly.png" width="50%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Butterfly valves can be used for on-off operation as well as throttling or regulating fluid flow. They are light weight, require little installation space, have low initial cost, are simple in design and can be easily repaired. Like plug and ball type valves, it is only necessary to rotate the valve stem a quarter turn on a butterfly valve to go from the full open to the closed position. Manual operating levers on butterfly valves are parallel to the piping when the valve is open and perpendicular to the piping when the valve is closed. 90° valve stem operation makes them very adaptable to automatic and remote control actuators. 
The disk in the butterfly valve is connected to the stem across its diameter. (See &lt;xref ref="Butterfly_png"/&gt; and &lt;xref ref="exploded_butterfly_png"/&gt;). When closed, the outer edge of the disk is in contact with a seat ring surrounding the opening through the valve body. To open the valve, the stem rotates the valve disk, until when fully open, the flat surfaces of the disk are parallel to the centerline of the pipe with fluid flowing past each side of the disk. 
The seat opening is lined with resilient, elastic materials like synthetic rubber, neoprene or Teflon. The disk edge presses into this material when closed to form a tight seal. 
&lt;figure xml:id="exploded_butterfly_png"&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Exploded view, Butterfly valve&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image source="images/exploded_butterfly.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
In symmetrical type butterfly valves (stem is centered on the thickness of the disk), a tight seal is a problem where the stem passes off the edge of the disk. Symmetrical butterfly valves are generally satisfactory for tightly sealing fluid leakage in fluid systems up to approximately 200 psig and 180 °F. 
To improve sealing, the eccentric or offset design butterfly valves are used. The stem is offset to one side of the disk so it does not interrupt the edge of the disk’s seal with seat ring. The stem may also be installed across the disk to one side of the maximum diameter. This allows a major portion of the disk’s edge to push it’s way into the seat material rather than slide into it. 
Offset butterfly valves seal tightly and have reasonable seat ring life up to about 700 psig with water to temperatures slightly above ambient. Pressure ratings drop with the rise in temperature with maximum temperature limits being 450 to 500 °F.

The steam cycle is an example of what is known by engineers as a cyclic heat engine. It is called cyclic, because it operates on a cycle. It uses a working fluid, water, which travels from point to point through the cycle, changing form and carrying energy, but eventually returning to the starting point restored to the same state that it started with. It is called a heat engine, because it transforms &lt;em&gt;heat&lt;/em&gt;, which is a form of energy, into &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;, another form of energy. The thermodynamic name for this cycle is the Rankine Cycle.

            <Text>Electricity is the backbone of modern civilization, supporting nearly every aspect of our lives.  Most people have used electricity every day of their lives without giving it much thought.
Electricity is not a single thing, rather the term encompasses a broad range of phenomena associated with the presence and movement of charged particles. Electricity is related to magnetism, both being part of the phenomenon of electromagnetism, as described by Maxwell's equations. 
Electrical phenomena include static electricity, electrical discharges like lightning and sparks, electromagnetic waves like light and x-rays, electromagnetic induction, electrical generation by induction, batteries and photoelectric effects; power transmission through conductors, resistance heating, conversion of electrical power to motion, and more.  .

            <Title>Energy Relationships in the Shipboard Propulsion Cycle</Title>
            <Text>The movement of a ship through the water is the result of a number of energy transformations. Although most of these transformations have been mentioned, they have not been discussed in the proper sequence. 
The first energy transformation occurs when fuel oil is burned in the boiler furnace. By the process of combustion, the chemical energy stored in the fuel oil is transformed into thermal energy. Thermal energy flows from the burning fuel to the water in the boiler, and steam is generated. The thermal energy is now stored as internal energy in the steam, as we can tell from the increased pressure and temperature of the steam. When the steam is admitted to the turbines, the thermal energy of the steam is converted into mechanical energy, which turns the shaft and drives the ship. Two main energy transformations are involved in converting thermal energy to work in a turbine. First, the thermal energy of the steam is transformed into mechanical kinetic energy (energy of motion) as the steam flows through one or more nozzles. Second, the mechanical kinetic energy of the steam is transformed into work (mechanical energy in transition) as the steam strikes the projecting blades of the turbine and thus causes the turbine to turn. The turning of the turbine rotor causes the propeller shaft to turn also, although at a slower speed, since the turbine is connected to the propeller shaft through reduction gears. The steam exhausts from the turbine to the condenser where it gives up its latent heat of condensation to the circulating seawater. 
For the remainder of this cycle, energy is required to get the water (condensate and feedwater) back to the boiler where it will again be heated and changed into steam. The energy used for this purpose is generally the thermal energy of the auxiliary steam. In the case of turbine driven feed pumps, the conversion of thermal energy to mechanical energy occurs in the same way as it does in the case of the propulsion turbines. In the case of motor-driven pumps, the energy conversion is from thermal energy to electrical energy (in a turbogenerator) and then from electrical energy to mechanical energy (work) in the pumps. 
As you can see, putting in 1 BTU at the boiler furnace does not mean that 778 foot-pounds of mechanical energy will be available for propelling the ship through the water. Some of the energy put in at the boiler furnace is used by auxiliary machinery such as pumps and forced-draft blowers to supply the boiler with feedwater, fuel oil, and air for combustion. Distilling plants, turbo-generators, steering gears, heating systems, galley and laundry equipment, and many other units throughout the ship use energy derived directly or indirectly from the energy put in at the boiler furnace. 
In addition, there are many &lt;q&gt;energy losses&lt;/q&gt; throughout the engineering plant. As we have seen, energy cannot actually be lost. But when it is transformed into a form of energy that we cannot use, we say there has been an energy loss. Since no insulation is perfect, some thermal energy is always lost as steam travels through the piping. Friction losses occur in all machinery and piping. There is also an energy loss at the condenser as the steam exhausted from the turbines gives up heat to the circulating seawater and turns into condensate. 
Although some energy losses can be partly avoided by designing the machinery and equipment to minimize friction losses, by insulating hot surfaces, and by lubricating moving parts, some energy losses are still unavoidable. Consider, for example, the unavoidable energy loss that occurs at the condenser. To allow the flow of heat, the condenser must be at a lower temperature than the boiler since heat flow can occur only from a higher temperature area to a lower temperature area. Therefore, the energy loss at the condenser is not only unavoidable, but is also actually required for the conversion of heat to work. 
As you can see, each BTU that is put in at the boiler furnace has to be divided in many ways before all the energy can be accounted for, but the energy account will always balance. &lt;em&gt;Energy in will always equal Energy out.&lt;/em&gt;

            <Title>Tubes and headers</Title>
            <Text>The boiler tubes connect the steam drum to the water drum, roughly in the shape of a letter &lt;q&gt;D.&lt;/q&gt; A boiler may contain perhaps 2000 tubes, most of which are considered &lt;em&gt;generating tubes&lt;/em&gt;, where the majority of the steam produced by the boiler is formed. As the steam formed in the generating tubes rises up to the steam drum, it must be replaced with cooler water from the steam drum. This water is carried down through tubes located in cooler areas of the boiler, known as &lt;em&gt;downcomers&lt;/em&gt;. A typical generating tube would be about 1 to 1½ inch diameter, while the downcomers are larger; 3 to 11 inches in diameter. 
The roof, rear, and side &lt;em&gt;waterwall tubes&lt;/em&gt; run up the sides and ceiling in the furnace area to protect the furnace walls from too much heat. These tubes normally act as downcomers, carrying water from the steam drum down to the water drum, but at high firing rates may act as generating tubes. Since waterwall tubes absorb the heat of the furnace, less refractory material is required to insulate the boiler, which reduces the total boiler weight. 
The first few rows of tubes in the gas path are known as &lt;em&gt;Screen tubes&lt;/em&gt;. Their location between the burner flames and the &lt;em&gt;superheater tubes&lt;/em&gt; protects the &lt;em&gt;superheater&lt;/em&gt; from the direct radiant heat of the flame. 

 &lt;em&gt;Headers&lt;/em&gt; are circular or square pressure vessels, used to distribute water to the boiler tubes. The &lt;em&gt;side wall&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;rear wall&lt;/em&gt; headers are supplied with water from a downcomer, and distribute it to the side and rear wall tubes, and in some boiler designs, a &lt;em&gt;screen tube&lt;/em&gt; header distributes water to the screen tubes. Sludge accumulates in the headers, and they must be blown down periodically like the water drum.

            <Text>Propulsion Motor Braking 
When the speed of a variable speed motor is reduced by reducing the frequency of the motor supply voltage, energy is fedback into  on the DC link will increase.This does not matter for small changes in motor speed, however, for large changes this could be a problem, as the feedback of large amounts of energy into the drive could cause damage. 
As this converter system uses a Diode Front End (DFE) (and not an active front end), this energy cannot be fed back into the supply network (regeneration). Therefore, an alternative means of dissipating this braking energy from the motor must be utilized. This system uses a chopper unit and this is connected to the DClink, and when the voltage of the DClink rises above a certain level due to the braking energy from the motor, the chopper unit will activate and feed the excess energyt o a braking resistive load - the Braking Resistor Unit (BRU). The braking resistors heat-up rapidly and this heat is then dissipated slowly. 
The main component of the chopper unit are IGBTs and these can handle large amounts of energy very quickly, and so this excess energy is dissipated from the drive rapidly. The control for theseIGBTs is from the PIBe unit in the AC OUT cubicle, this provides the trigger pulses for both the output IGBTs and the chopper IGBTs. The IGBTs in the chopper unit will switch the excessDC voltage to the braking resistors until such a time as the voltage on the DC link falls to a normal value. 
The braking resistor units are installed forward and aft of the associated frequency converter rooms at 4th deck level. The specification of the braking resistors are as follows:

The resistors are made up of grids of stainless steel alloy and these are spot welded together in banks mounted between two end plates, supported both horizontally and vertically by porcelain insulators. 
The assemblies are mounted in an enclosed cabinet that is cooled by an air to water cooling unit, the cooling air flow is by natural convection as the hot air from the resistors rises and is cooled by the air to water heat exchanger and the rise of the hot air from the resistors draws in cool air from the bottom of the enclosure. The cooling water is supplied from the propulsion auxiliary fresh water cooling system. The cooler has a water leakage detector fitted and temperature monitoring via two PT100 sensors. 
A thermostatically controlled 120V 50W anti-condensation heater is also fitted in the braking resistor enclosure.

In order to avoid a large energy storage in the braking resistors, the activation of the braking resistors is managed as follows: 
	•	If zero speed or reverse speed is requested the activation of the braking chopper is restricted to under 40% of full speed. 
	•	In a crash stop situation when: 
	•	Two motors are running, the activation of the chopper is allowed under 50% of full speed. 
	•	One motor running, the activation of the chopper is allowed under 45% of full speed. 
In a crash stop situation, the air temperatureH andHH limitations are inhibited and only an alarm will be raised.</Text>

            <Title>Atomization of Fuel</Title>
            <Text>As used in connection with fuel injection, atomization means the breaking up of the fuel, as it enters the cylinder, into small particles which form a mist-like spray. Atomization of the fuel must meet the requirements of the type of combustion chamber in use. Some chambers require very fine atomization, others can function with coarser atomization. Proper atomization facilitates the starting of the burning process and ensures that each minute particle of fuel will be surrounded by particles of oxygen with which it can combine. 
Atomization is generally obtained when the liquid fuel, under high pressure, passes through the small opening, or openings, in the injector or nozzle. The fuel enters the combustion space at high velocity because the pressure in the cylinder is lower than the fuel pressure. The friction, resulting from the fuel passing through the air at high velocity, causes the fuel to break up into small particles.</Text>

            <Text>The unit-factor method or the unity bracket method is a widely used method for unit conversions using the rules of algebra. This method utilizes the fact that any number or expression can be multiplied by one (unity) without changing its value.  The advantage of this method is that it explicitly accounts for units, rather than treating a conversion factor as a magic number.
To use this method, conversion factors are expressed as fraction equal to one, and multiplied against the original value while keeping careful track of the units in each term. Multiplying a value by a unit-factor and canceling any dimensional units appearing in both the numerator and denominator will express the original quantity in different units. 
For example, since \inch{1} = \cm{2.54}, dividing both sides by \inch{1} inch gives the unit-factor&lt;me&gt; 1 = \left[\frac{\cm{2.54}}{\inch{1}}\right]&lt;/me&gt;.  The fraction bar in this term can be read as &lt;q&gt;per&lt;/q&gt;, so this unit-factor says that there are &lt;q&gt;2.54 centimeters per inch&lt;/q&gt;.
To convert 36 inches to cm, just multiply by 36 inches by the appropriate unit-factor, and cancel the inch units that appear in both the numerator and denominator.
&lt;me&gt;\inch{36}  \times \left[\frac{\cm{2.54} }{\inch{1}}\right] =  36 \cancel{\text{ in}} \times \left[\frac{2.54 \text{ cm}}{\cancel{1 \text{ in}}}\right] = \cm{91.44}&lt;/me&gt;
To convert from cm to inches, use the reciprocal of this unit-factor, which is also unity.
&lt;me&gt;\cm{100}  \times \left[\frac{\inch{1}}{\cm{2.54} }\right] =  100 \cancel{\text{ cm}} \times \left[\frac{1 \text{ in}}{2.54 \cancel{\text{ cm}}}\right] = \inch{39.37}&lt;/me&gt;
Thus \yd{1} (\inch{36}) is a bit shorter than a meter (\cm{100}), and \m{1} is a little more than \inch{39}.
Unit conversion is often easier within the the SI system, since the relations between units are logical, and the prefixes increase or decrease by &lt;m&gt;10^3&lt;/m&gt;, so unit conversions can often be done in your head.
Several different conversion factors can be applied sequentially or simultaneously until only the desired set of dimensional units remains. This way, you only need to remember a few common conversion factors to make many different conversions.  Here are some relations that you should remember:
&lt;md&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt; \mi{1}  \amp = \ft{5280} &lt;/mrow&gt;

 &lt;caption&gt;Gear Pump&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;image source="images/gear_pump.png" width="50%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Gear pumps are probably the most common type of rotary pump, and &lt;xref ref="gear_pump_png"/&gt; illustrates a typical example. The liquid is carried from the suction to the discharge in the spaces between the gear teeth and the surface of the pump casing as the gears rotate. One of the gears is directly driven by the source of power, while the other, called the   rotates with it in the opposite direction. This is accomplished either because motion is imparted from the drive gear to the idler gear by the meshing of the two gears at the center of the pump chamber, or because   outside the pump chamber transmit motion from one gear shaft to the other. 
There are close clearances between the gear teeth and the pump casing, and between the teeth of the two gears at their point of contact where they form a continuous fluid-tight joint. As the gears rotate in the direction indicated by the arrows, liquid is trapped in turn between each pair of teeth and the casing and carried away from the suction side of the pump. At the same time, as the teeth un-mesh at the center of the pump chamber, a low pressure is left in the empty space between the gear teeth. Liquid flows in to fill the low pressure areas between the gear teeth. As the gear teeth re-mesh on the discharge side of the pump, the liquid in between the gear teeth is forced out, eventually flowing to the discharge connection on the pump casing. 
Three kinds of true gears are used: spur, helical and herringbone. Spur and helical gear pumps can be rotated in the opposite direction to reverse the flow through the pump while generally that is not possible with the herringbone design. When the latter is rotated in the wrong direction, liquid is trapped in the middle of the &lt;q&gt;V&lt;/q&gt; resulting in pressure strains on the shafts and bearings. 
The herringbone gear pump utilizes gears with a very steep &lt;q&gt;V&lt;/q&gt; shape to the gear teeth. These designs are employed when very smooth discharge is desired. The steep angle on the gear teeth, however; prevents the gear driven by an outside source from turning the idler gear. The steep angle causes the gear teeth to jam together rather than rotate freely. Rotary motion is transmitted to the idler shaft via a set of timing gears instead. The timing gears prevent driving contact between pumping gears to eliminate the jamming problem.

            <Text>The process of igniting the flame in the boiler is called &lt;em&gt;lighting off&lt;/em&gt;. This is a critical operation because following incorrect procedures can lead to a furnace explosion. A boiler is lit off manually with a flaming torch, or with an automatic igniter. 
To prevent a boiler explosion, there must be no unburned fuel or fuel vapors in the furnace when the torch is inserted. We insure this by properly &lt;em&gt;purging&lt;/em&gt; the furnace prior to lighting off. To purge, open all register air doors and run the forced draft fans on High Speed for at least five minutes. Only after a good purge is it safe to insert the torch, turn on the fuel supply, and light off the burner. Once one burner is lit off, adjoining burners can easily be lit from the flame of the first. Automated systems follow the same procedure automatically, but use an igniter instead of a torch.

            <Title>Rotary Pumps</Title>
            <Text>All the many varieties of rotary pumps operate on the same principle. An element called the   is rotated in the pump chamber in such a way that the liquid is carried or pushed from the suction side of the pump to the discharge side. 
Rotary pumps are positive displacement, since they deliver a fixed quantity of liquid for each operational cycle or revolution of the pump shaft. This means that they want to move liquid even when the pump discharge is blocked. If the discharge of a rotary pump were closed with the pump operating, and if no pressure relief valve was installed in the pump discharge line, pressure would build up till the shaft seal failed, the electric motor overloaded and stopped, the engine driving the pump stalled, the pump casing or discharge piping ruptured, or some other casualty resulted. 
When a rotary pump is operating at a constant speed, the amount of liquid delivered to the discharge line decreases slightly as the discharge pressure working against the pump increases. The drop in discharge capacity is due to increased internal leakage through the close clearances between stationary and moving parts in the pump housing. As the discharge pressure increases, the leakage rate from the discharge to the suction side of the pump, through the internal clearances, increases. This internal leakage reduces the pump’s discharge capacity, and is known as  
There are dozens of designs for the rotors of rotary pumps. Gears may be used as in &lt;xref ref="gear_pump_png"/&gt;, but with almost any number of teeth, and in a variety of forms; elements that look like gears may be employed, although one of the pair may not be capable of rotating the other; two, three, or more lobes may be used; screws may be used which carry the liquid through the pump in their hollowed-out channels; sliding or swinging vanes may be used which form a seal with the walls of the chamber because they are pushed from the center of the rotor by mechanical arrangements or are thrown out by centrifugal force; small pistons moving in and out from the center of the rotor may be used to push liquid through the pump; and there are still more varieties. A few representative designs of rotary pumps will be described in the following sections.

            <Text>You must immediately extinguish fires if there is any doubt as to where the level is, either high or low.

You must never add water to a boiler that has gone out-of-sight low until it has cooled, to avoid damage caused by water coming into contact with overheated pressure parts.

If the boiler water level is falling gradually due to a slow leak or a feed problem but has not yet gone out of sight, you can slow down to reduce load on the boiler and feedwater demand, then attempt to restore the boiler level. You can reduce steam demand further by stripping the main switchboard of non-vital consumers, or by starting the auxiliary generator and tripping the turbogenerator.  Try to correct the problem while carefully watching the drum level and maintaining the level in sight.  If you are unable to restore the level, shut the boiler down, and operate on the other until the problem can be rectified. 

Some things to look for:

*	Low feed pressure; try adjusting the feed pump controller set point
*	Tripped feed pump; reset trip and restart
*	DC heater empty; check make up feed system
*	Feed pump recirculation valve open too wide; check and close 
*	Feed pressure lost through an idle feed pump; check and close
*	Feedwater regulator failure; check control air pressure, switch to manual control or feed the boiler through the auxiliary feed line
*	Feed pump nozzle being left shut

If the drum level has gone out of sight, or is falling rapidly due to a major tube leak, you must initiate a forced boiler shutdown immediately.  Begin by securing the fires, slowing down and notifying the bridge.  Insure that the master sender is aligned to the remaining boiler. Then close the feed stops, the steam stops, and open the superheater vent.  Reduce the pressure in the boiler by jacking open a safety valve.  Let the furnace cool, drain the boiler, inspect the tubes, and repair the leak.</Text>

There are several well-known formulas for the areas of simple shapes such as triangles, rectangles, and circles. Using these formulas, the area of any polygon can be found by dividing the polygon into triangles. For shapes with a curved boundary, calculus is usually required to compute the area. Indeed, the problem of determining the area of plane figures was a major motivation for the historical development of calculus. 
Mathematics provides various formulas and methods to find the area of different shapes and surfaces. Here are some common mathematical approaches: 
Geometric Formulas: For basic shapes like rectangles, squares, triangles, circles, and polygons, there are well-known formulas to calculate their areas. For instance: 
Area of a square: 
To calculate the area of a square, multiply the length of one side by the other (equal length sides). 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Area = a2&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image25.png"/&gt;
   Picture 116
&lt;/figure&gt;
a = length of side 
Area of a rectangle: 
To calculate the area of a rectangle, multiply the width by the height. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Area = w × h&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image26.png"/&gt;
   Picture 115
&lt;/figure&gt;
w = width 
h = height 
Area of Triangle: 
To calculate the area of a triangle, multiply \frac{1}{2} the base times the height. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Area = ½ × b × h&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image27.png"/&gt;
   Picture 114
&lt;/figure&gt;
b = base 
h = vertical height 
Area of Circle: 
To calculate the area of a circle, multiply the radius squared by π=3,.14. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Area = π × r2&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image28.png"/&gt;
   Picture 113
&lt;/figure&gt;
r = radius 
Integration: For irregular shapes or curves, calculus can be used. By integrating appropriate functions over a given interval, you can find the area under a curve or between curves. This method is particularly useful for finding the area of regions bounded by curves in the Cartesian coordinate system. 
Dissection and Composition: This method involves decomposing complex shapes into simpler shapes whose areas are known. For example, a complex shape might be divided into rectangles, triangles, circles, etc., and then the areas of these simpler shapes are calculated individually and summed up to find the total area. 
Coordinate Geometry: In the Cartesian coordinate system, the area of a polygon can be calculated using the shoelace formula or by dividing the polygon into triangles and summing their areas. 
Vector Calculus: In three-dimensional space, vector calculus can be used to find the area of surfaces. For example, the surface area of a parametrically defined surface can be found using a surface integral. 
Limit Process: The area of a shape can also be approximated using a limit process, where you divide the shape into smaller and smaller pieces and sum their areas. As the size of the pieces approaches zero, the sum converges to the exact area of the shape. 
These are just a few examples of how mathematics can be used to find area, and there are many other techniques and methods depending on the specific shape or surface being considered.

            <Text>PASCAL’S PRINCIPLE 
A change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to all portions of the fluid and to the walls of its container. 
Pascal’s principle, an experimentally verified fact, is what makes pressure so important in fluids. Since a change in pressure is transmitted undiminished in an enclosed fluid, we often know more about pressure than other physical quantities in fluids. Moreover, Pascal’s principle implies that &lt;em&gt;the total pressure in a fluid is the sum of the pressures from different sources&lt;/em&gt;. We shall find this fact—that pressures add—very useful. 
Blaise Pascal had an interesting life in that he was home-schooled by his father who removed all of the mathematics textbooks from his house and forbade him to study mathematics until the age of 15. This, of course, raised the boy’s curiosity, and by the age of 12, he started to teach himself geometry. Despite this early deprivation, Pascal went on to make major contributions in the mathematical fields of probability theory, number theory, and geometry. He is also well known for being the inventor of the first mechanical digital calculator, in addition to his contributions in the field of fluid statics. 
Application of Pascal’s Principle 
One of the most important technological applications of Pascal’s principle is found in a &lt;em&gt;hydraulic system&lt;/em&gt;, which is an enclosed fluid system used to exert forces. The most common hydraulic systems are those that operate car brakes. Let us first consider the simple hydraulic system shown in &lt;xref ref="one-cubic-inch"/&gt;

&lt;figure xml:id="one-cubic-inch"&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;1 cubic inch    A small force can be converted into a larger force when pressure is transmitted through liquids in different containers with pistons that are connected.
&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image9.jpeg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
A typical hydraulic system with two fluid-filled cylinders, capped with pistons and connected by a tube called a hydraulic line. A downward force F1F1 on the left piston creates a pressure that is transmitted undiminished to all parts of the enclosed fluid. This results in an upward force F2F2 on the right piston that is larger than F1F1 because the right piston has a larger area.

            <Text>A diesel engine converts the energy stored in the fuel's chemical bonds into mechanical energy by burning the fuel. The chemical reaction of burning the fuel liberates heat, which causes the gases to expand, forcing the piston to rotate the crankshaft. Ignition occurs in a diesel by injecting fuel into the air charge which has been heated by compression to a temperature greater than the ignition point of the fuel. 

A four-stroke engine requires two rotations of the crankshaft to complete one cycle. The event occur as follows:  &lt;ul marker=""&gt;
Intake &lt;mdash/&gt; the piston passes TDC, the intake valve(s) open and the fresh air is admitted into the cylinder, the exhaust valve is still open for a few degrees to allow scavenging to occur. 
Compression &lt;mdash/&gt; after the piston passes BDC the intake valve closes and the piston travels up to TDC (completion of the first crankshaft rotation). 
Fuel injection &lt;mdash/&gt; As the piston nears TDC on the compression stroke, the fuel is injected by the injectors and the fuel starts to burn, further heating the gases in the cylinder. 
Power &lt;mdash/&gt; the piston passes TDC and the expanding gases force the piston down, rotating the crankshaft. 
Exhaust &lt;mdash/&gt; as the piston passes BDC the exhaust valves open and the exhaust gases start to flow out of the cylinder. This continues as the piston travels up to TDC, pumping the spent gases out of the cylinder. At TDC the second crankshaft rotation is complete.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
A two-stroke engine requires one rotation of the crankshaft to complete one cycle. The events occur as follows: &lt;ul marker=""&gt; 
Intake &lt;mdash/&gt; the piston is near BDC and exhaust is in progress. The intake valve or ports open and the fresh air is forced in. The exhaust valves or ports are closed and intake continues. 
Compression &lt;mdash/&gt; after both the exhaust and intake valves or ports are closed, the piston travels up towards TDC. The fresh air is heated by the compression. 
Fuel injection &lt;mdash/&gt; near TDC the fuel is injected by the injectors and the fuel starts to burn, further heating the gases in the cylinder. 
Power &lt;mdash/&gt; the piston passes TDC and the expanding gases force the piston down, rotating the crankshaft. 
Exhaust &lt;mdash/&gt; as the piston approaches BDC the exhaust valves or ports open and the exhaust gases start to flow out of the cylinder.

            <Text>Although there are dozens of different types of motors, the most important type of motor for industrial applications, by far, is the induction motor.  
Induction motors have many advantages over other designs.  First they are simple, rugged, reliable and require very little maintenance.  Induction motors are relatively cost-effective to manufacture, and are widely available in a broad size range, for all common single and three-phase voltages.  The can be quite efficient, especially at full load. Modern designs and technologies, such as variable frequency drives (VFDs), contribute to improved efficiency allow precise control of motor speed and performance.
Induction motors are the subject of this section.</Text>

            <Title>Suction Head</Title>
            <Text>The distance between the surface of the liquid in the supply tank and the centerline of the pump suction describes the pump suction head. 
  Positive suction head, also called  gravity head, occurs when the liquid level in the supply tank is &lt;em&gt;above&lt;/em&gt; the center of the pump suction. The height of the liquid creates a pressure on the suction side of the pump that is greater than atmospheric pressure, and gravity causes the liquid to flow into the pump suction. In this situation, very little power is required to draw the liquid into the pump. 
  Negative suction head, also called  suction lift, occurs when the liquid level in the supply tank is &lt;em&gt;below&lt;/em&gt; the center of the pump suction. In this case, the pump must create the force necessary to lift the liquid uphill against the force of gravity and draw it into the pump suction. This process obviously requires more pumping power than when there is a positive suction head. 
To pump when there is a suction lift, we use the atmospheric pressure on the surface of the liquid in the supply tank to push the liquid up the pipe to the pump suction, much like sucking on a straw. If the pressure inside the suction pipe is reduced to 13.7 psia compared to the 14.7 psia on the surface of the water in the supply tank, than the water level in the suction pipe should be 2.31 feet higher than the water level in the supply tank. (remember: 1 psi = 2.31 feet of fresh water!). Now if the pressure in the suction pipe is lowered to 0 psia, the atmospheric pressure should theoretically push the water up against the force of gravity (14.7 x 2.31 = 33.96 feet) 34 feet inside the suction pipe. The suction side of the pump will be operating at a pressure lower than atmospheric (under a vacuum) when the pump is lifting. 34 feet of suction lift is the theoretical maximum for fresh water, but in the real world, the maximum suction lift is less.

            <Text>In industry, pipe and tube are nearly interchangeable terms. Both describe long hollow cylinders of uniform material with a certain amount of rigidity and permanence.
Pipes are primarily used for fluid transport and are almost always cylindrical.  Generally, pipe and pipe fittings are sized in terms of a Nominal Pipe Size (NPS) or Nominal Diameter (DN), which corresponds to the approximate inside diameter (ID). The internal diameter is the critical dimension for fluid flow, since it is needed to calculate pipe capacity, flow rates, and frictional losses.  Additionally, pipes must have sufficient wall thickness to handle the expected internal pressure.  Pipes have somewhat lenient tolerances, and may have variations in wall thickness along their length.
Tubes, like pipes, are used for fluid transport, but also for other applications, particularly for fabricating structures. (For example, scaffolding and bike frames.)  Pipes are rigid and resistant to bending but some tubes such as copper and plastic tubes are flexible enough to be easily bent. 
Tubes are available with various cross-sections, including round, square, rectangular, or oval.  They usually have thinner walls than pipe, making them lighter but less capable of handling high internal pressures. They are often chosen for applications where weight is a consideration. 
Tubes are sized based on their exact outside dimensions and wall thickness.  Tubes are manufactured with tighter tolerances than pipe, resulting in more precise dimensions and wall thickness consistency.  
Hoses are also used for fluid transport, but hoses are typically more portable and flexible, and are made up of multiple layers of different materials.

            <Title>Construction</Title>
            <Text>Globe valves are designed for tight closure and throttling applications. When a globe   valve is used to throttle or regulate fluid flow, the disk surface that closes against   the seat should be made from metal, not synthetic materials. Throttling a fluid creates   erosion (wearing away) of the disk surface and the seat surface that the fluid flows   between. This erosion may show up as general roughness or as small grooves cut across   the surfaces of the seat and disk, called &lt;em&gt;wire drawing&lt;/em&gt;. These defects on the   precisely machined surfaces of the seat and disk result in leakage when the valve is   closed. In service where erosion will be a problem, the seat and disk can be fabricated   from very hard materials, such as stellite, to extend the life of the seat and disk   contact surfaces. 
The valve body contains the internal opening that the fluid flows through. It   is called the &lt;em&gt;seat&lt;/em&gt; if the opening is machined directly into the valve body   material. It is called a &lt;em&gt;seat ring&lt;/em&gt; if it is a separate and replaceable part   from the valve body. Replaceable seat rings are generally manufactured from harder,   longer wearing materials than the valve body to be more resistant to fluid erosion at   this location. Seat rings may be retained in the valve body by machine screw threads,   press fit, welding or by what is known as a &lt;em&gt;shrink fit&lt;/em&gt;. In shrink fit   applications, the machined hole in the valve body that the seat ring fits into is a few   thousandths of an inch smaller in diameter than the outside diameter of the seat ring.   Therefore, it is impossible for the ring to fit into the hole in the valve body. During   assembly the valve body is heated, causing the machined seat ring hole to expand. The   seat ring is also frozen at the same time to decrease its outside diameter. With both   parts at the proper temperature, the seat ring now has an outside diameter that is   smaller than the inside diameter of the machined hole in the valve body. At this point,   the seat ring is placed quickly and accurately into the valve body. As the temperature   of the two parts begin to equalize, the ring expands and the machined hole shrinks and   places a compressive force around the outside of the ring, locking it very tightly in   place. 
The valve body has two external openings (and in some special valves, more) for the   entrance and exit of fluid from the piping system. These openings can be connected to   the piping using pipe threads, soldering, flanges, welding, or gluing. 
The top of the valve body generally has an opening for the valve disk and stem to fit   through. At this opening, the other sub-assembly, called the &lt;em&gt;bonnet&lt;/em&gt; is   attached. 
The bonnet normally contains the equipment necessary to operate the movable   disk. It is attached to the body by machine screw threads or flanges . Large valves and   valves in high pressure service normally have a gasket between the bonnet and the body   made from sheet packing, flat metallic rings or spiral wound metallic type material.   Small valves may have the bonnet and body sealed by a lapped metal to metal fit with no   gaskets. 
&lt;figure xml:id="osborneglobe_png"&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Angle Globe Valve&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image source="images/osborneglobe.png" width="50%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; 
   &lt;term&gt;Construction Details.&lt;/term&gt; Several interesting construction details are shown in     &lt;xref ref="osborneglobe_png"/&gt;, which shows a manually operated right-angle globe   valve. 
This valve has a stem with a collar machined on the end. The disk   slides over the collar and is retained on the end of the stem by a valve disk plug  (or  disk nut ) which is attached to the disk by machine threads.   Since the disk plug is prevented from sliding off the end of the stem by the collar, it   effectively fastens the disk to the stem. The disk nut does not lock the disk tightly to   the stem, rather the disk is allowed to move slightly around the collar on the end of   the valve stem. This small movement allows the disk to align itself properly with the   seat as it closes for a leak free seal. In this valve, the stem is also the device that   keeps the disk correctly aligned with the seat, regardless of how far the disk is   removed from the seat. 
Where the valve stem passes through the bonnet to the outside of the valve, the bonnet   has a stuffing box, packing, and a packing gland  installed to   minimize fluid leakage at this point. 
This valve stem uses Acme Threads, a thread type with no points, just below   the point where the hand-wheel is installed. The valve stem threads engage the   internal threads of the &lt;em&gt;yolk bushing&lt;/em&gt;, which is made from a softer material than   the valve stem, e.g. bronze, brass etc. If the stem has too much rotational force   applied, the yoke bushing threads strip instead of the valve stem threads. The yoke   bushing is a replaceable part and is screwed into the upper part of the bonnet with   machine threads. When the valve hand-wheel is turned in the clockwise direction, the   valve stem threads engaged with the yoke bushing threads cause the stem to move inward   pushing the disk toward the seat closing the valve. 
The upper part of the bonnet on this particular valve is split into two supporting   uprights from the area where the packing gland is installed to the location of the yoke   bushing. This type of upper bonnet design is called an outside yolk and stem. </Text>

            <Title>Burners</Title>
            <Text>Several fuel oil burners are located on the front of the boiler to deliver fuel and air to the boiler furnace in the proper mixture to obtain optimum combustion. The burner assembly, &lt;xref ref="register_png"/&gt;, consists of two main parts, the &lt;em&gt;fuel oil atomizer&lt;/em&gt; assembly, which breaks up the fuel oil into a fine mist and sprays it into the furnace, and the &lt;em&gt;air register&lt;/em&gt; assembly, which directs the air flow into the furnace to insure good air/fuel mixture for complete combustion. The burner may also include a peephole or a flame scanner to monitor the status of the flame, a torch hole for lighting the flame, and/or an igniter so that the burner can be lit off automatically as required by the combustion control system. 
&lt;figure xml:id="register_png"&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure xml:id="atomizer_png"&gt;
 &lt;caption&gt;Atomizer&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;image source="pics/boilers/atomizer.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
A cross sectional view of a &lt;em&gt;steam atomizer&lt;/em&gt; is shown in &lt;xref ref="atomizer_png"/&gt;. In this design, steam under pressure is used to force fuel through the &lt;em&gt;sprayer plate&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;orifice&lt;/em&gt; and into the furnace as small droplets with high velocity which ignite easily and mix thoroughly with the surrounding air. The fuel forms a cone-shaped spray of oil which extends far into the furnace. Steam atomizers are capable of providing good atomization at all steaming rates, however the steam used for atomization is lost from the steam cycle and must be replaced with make-up feed. 
When steam is not available for atomization, such as when lighting off a dead ship, a steam assist atomizer can not be used. Under these circumstances, a &lt;em&gt;straight mechanical&lt;/em&gt; atomizer is used instead. In this design, fuel pressure alone atomizes the fuel into tiny particles. The quality of the atomization depends on the fuel pressure, so this design is not particularly suitable for use when the boiler load and fuel pressure are varying frequently, as it requires the operator to frequently change sprayer plates to compensate for varying fuel pressures. 
The register assembly consists of three main parts. The &lt;em&gt;movable air doors&lt;/em&gt; allow the operator to open and close the register. The doors are opened wide when the register is in service, and closed when it is not being used. The &lt;em&gt;diffuser plate&lt;/em&gt; helps the air to mix evenly with the oil and it prevents the flame from being blown back behind the atomizer. The &lt;em&gt;stationary air foils&lt;/em&gt; guide the majority of the air, giving it a swirling motion and directing it toward the oil cone beyond the diffuser. 
The air and gas flow paths through the boiler are shown in &lt;xref ref="boilergasflow_png"/&gt;. Air supplied by the forced draft fan passes across the tubes of a steam heated air heater, and then through the boiler casing where it picks up more heat. The air passes through the register and into the furnace, where it meets up with fuel sprayed by the atomizer. It immediately ignites, and the burner flame liberates heat energy from the fuel to heat the water in the boiler. Some of this heat is in the form of thermal radiation which shines on the exposed screen and wall tubes. Other energy resides in the thermal energy of the combustion gases. These hot combustion gases flow from the furnace through the screen tubes, past the superheater tubes and the main generating bank and finally across the economizer tubes, losing heat and dropping in temperature along the way. Finally, the hot combustion gases pass up the smokestack to the atmosphere.

            <Title>Water level</Title>
            <Text>Maintaining proper boiler water level in the steam drum is probably the most critical aspect of boiler operation. &lt;em&gt;High Water&lt;/em&gt; is harmful because it reduces the efficiency of the steam separators. More importantly, excessively high water will enter the dry pipe, pass through the superheater and enter the turbine – a condition known as &lt;em&gt;carryover&lt;/em&gt;. Carryover leads to dangerous &lt;em&gt;water hammer&lt;/em&gt; in the steam lines, scaling in the superheater, and will damage to turbine rotors and thrust bearings. &lt;em&gt;Low Water&lt;/em&gt; is perhaps even more harmful than high water. It the boiler water level falls too low, portions of the generating tubes will be uncovered and the furnace temperature will quickly overheat and weaken the boiler tubes, leading to catastrophic boiler damage, steam escape, and personnel injury. 
The boiler is equipped with several means to observe the boiler water level. The simplest is the &lt;em&gt;boiler gage glass&lt;/em&gt;. This device is mounted on the steam drum and makes the water level in the drum directly visible in the same way that the glass on the side of a coffee urn works. The glass is mounted such that the normal operating level is in the center of the glass, and as long as the water level is visible in the glass, the boiler is safe, however the operator should never let the level get within two inches of the top or bottom of the gage glass. A visible water level in the gage glass is reassuring, but it may be a false level if the gage glass valves are closed or the lines are blocked. Periodically blowing down the gage glass will insure that it indicates accurately. The &lt;em&gt;remote level indicator&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;xref ref="waterlevel_png"/&gt;, is a water level sensor connected to a level display that can be mounted in any location, normally wherever convenient for the boiler operator. This device is also called the &lt;em&gt;eye-hi&lt;/em&gt; indicator. &lt;em&gt;High and Low Level Alarms&lt;/em&gt; are sensors which are used to trigger an alarm when the water reaches a critical level. Usually two sensors are provided, the first gives a warning signal when the level is about six inches above or below the normal water level, the second secures the fires if the level continues to rise or fall after the warning alarm. 
&lt;important&gt;
The boiler water level must be visible in the gage glass at all times. Any time the water level is not visible, either high or low, the boiler fires must be secured &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;/important&gt;

 &lt;image source="pics/boilers/waterlevel.png" width="50%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
The feed water regulator system is designed to monitor and maintain the water level in the boiler automatically under all normal loads and operating conditions. The main feed pump takes a suction from the DC Heater, and discharges through the feedwater regulating valve, then into the economizer and the steam drum. The feedwater regulator contains a &lt;em&gt;drum level sensor&lt;/em&gt; which opens or closes the regulating valve in response to the drum water level. When the water level goes up, the regulating valve closes off to restrict the feed water to the drum and bring the level down, and vice versa. This drum level sensing regulator uses &lt;em&gt;feedback control&lt;/em&gt;, which means that is has a fairly slow response; the drum level must deviate from normal before the regulator can make a correction. To improve the regulator response, most feedwater regulator systems also include a steam flow sensor, which gives the regulator a predictive ability known as &lt;em&gt;feedforward control&lt;/em&gt;. As soon as the sensor detects a change in the steam flow, it can respond immediately with a corresponding change in the feedwater flow rate. Feedwater regulators containing both drum level and steam flow sensors are known as &lt;em&gt;two-element&lt;/em&gt; feedwater regulators. 
The feed water regulator system uses compressed air from the &lt;em&gt;combustion control air system&lt;/em&gt; to actuate the feed water regulator valve and power the regulator. The watch engineer must carefully watch the control air system pressure, because problems there will quickly lead to problems with the boiler water level. If the control air compressor fails, one response would be to cross connect the &lt;em&gt;ship’s service air&lt;/em&gt; into the system. Complete loss of compressed air will cause the feedwater regulator valve to open wide. The operator then must adjust the feed water check valve manually to regulate the boiler drum level. 
The discharge pressure of the feed pump plays a critical role in the proper operation of the feedwater regulator system. Naturally, the feed pump discharge pressure must be greater than the steam drum pressure at all times, or the feed water will not be able to flow into the boiler. Also, if the feed pump discharge pressure fluctuates, the regulator system will have a difficult time responding properly, so the feed pump is equipped with a &lt;em&gt;constant pressure governor&lt;/em&gt; which maintains a steady discharge pressure at all times, or an &lt;em&gt;excess pressure governor&lt;/em&gt;, which maintains a fixed pressure differential above the drum pressure. The watch engineer should keep a close eye on the feed pump discharge pressure, because changes here will quickly lead to problems with the steam drum level. A stand-by feed pump should always be maintained ready to start quickly if the operating pump has problems. 
When operating, the boiler water level is subject to &lt;em&gt;shrink and swell&lt;/em&gt;. The specific volume of steam is dependent on the pressure of the surroundings; lower pressure steam takes up more space. When the main engine throttles are opened, the boiler pressure temporarily drops as the steam rushes to the turbine. This drop in pressure causes the steam bubbles remaining in the generating tubes to expand, forcing the water level in the drum to rise or &lt;em&gt;swell&lt;/em&gt;. When the throttles are closed the reverse happens; the boiler pressure increases quickly, and compresses the steam bubbles, causing the water level to &lt;em&gt;shrink&lt;/em&gt;. A properly adjusted two-element feed water regulator will respond properly to shrink and swell. For example, during swell conditions the drum level sensor sees high water and asks the regulating valve to close off, while at the same time, the steam flow sensor detects an increase in steam flow, and asks the regulating valve to open more. The two effects cancel each other out, and the regulating valve holds its position, which is the correct response, since the actual mass of water in the boiler really hasn’t changed. Later as the drum pressure recovers, the swell subsides and the steam flow signal remains, causing the regulator to open a bit more. Close observation of the feed water regulator during maneuvering will be valuable if you are ever called upon to regulate the boiler water level manually.

            <Title>Superheater</Title>
            <Text>Steam collected in the dry pipe is directed to the superheater section of the boiler, where it is superheated to improve the efficiency of the steam cycle.
Water boils at a particular temperature which is determined by the pressure of the surroundings called the saturation temperature.  For example, water at atmospheric pressure always boils at 212 °F, while water at 600 psia always boils at 486 °F.   The saturation temperature for water at a given temperature can be looked up in steam tables.
Steam temperature can be raised above the saturation temperature by adding additional more heat energy, but this must occur in an area where there is no liquid water present, or the heat would simply boil more water and would not raise the temperature.
This heating occurs in the superheater, which is a bank of boiler tubes located in the hottest portions of the combustion gas path. Since there is no liquid water in the superheater, all heat added there produces superheat.

            <Title>Pressure Gauge Construction</Title>
            <Text>A pressure gauge is a common instrument used to measure pressure in a wide range of applications. 
Bourdon Tube 
A bourdon pressure gauge is the most common type of pressure gauge and it uses a curved tube that straightens under pressure and shows the reading on a dial. The Bourdon gauge consists of a tube bent into a coil or an arc. As the pressure in the tube increases, the coil unwinds. A pointer connected to the end of the tube can be attached to a lever and a pointer calibrated to indicate pressure. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Bourdon Tube Pressure Gauge&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image8.jpeg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Pressure Transducer 
A pressure transducer is an electronic device that converts pressure into an electrical signal. It is often used in automated systems or where electronic data acquisition is required. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Pressure Transducer&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image17.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Pressure is defined as force per unit area. Can pressure be increased in a fluid by pushing directly on the fluid? Yes, but it is much easier if the fluid is enclosed. The heart, for example, increases blood pressure by pushing directly on the blood in an enclosed system (valves closed in a chamber). If you try to push on a fluid in an open system, such as a river, the fluid flows away. An enclosed fluid cannot flow away, and so pressure is more easily increased by an applied force. 
What happens to a pressure in an enclosed fluid? Since atoms in a fluid are free to move about, they transmit the pressure to all parts of the fluid and to the walls of the container. Remarkably, the pressure is transmitted &lt;em&gt;undiminished&lt;/em&gt;. This phenomenon is called Pascal’s principle, because it was first clearly stated by the French philosopher and scientist Blaise Pascal (1623–1662): A change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to all portions of the fluid and to the walls of its container.</Text>

            <Text>&lt;sidebyside width="50%"  valign="middle"&gt;
A pressure below atmospheric pressure is called a vacuum. The farther below the atmospheric pressure, the greater the vacuum. Vacuum cannot be increased without limit, however. At some point, the pressure drops as low as possible and a perfect vacuum is achieved. A perfect vacuum is the lowest possible pressure, or the absence of all pressure. When we speak of a &lt;q&gt;high&lt;/q&gt; vacuum, we are talking about a low absolute pressure.

&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Pressure Scales &lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image source="images/pressure-scales.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/sidebyside&gt;

When measuring a vacuum, there are three possible methods. &lt;ul&gt;
When vacuum is measured starting with zero at perfect vacuum and increasing as pressure rises, then the greater the value, the smaller the vacuum. This is simply the absolute pressure scale. 
We can also measure pressure on a scale starting at zero at atmospheric pressure, and indicating negative values when the pressure is below atmospheric pressure. This is gage pressure scale, and what happens when a vacuum is applied to a standard pressure gage. 
And finally, we can measure vacuum on a scale starting with zero at atmospheric pressure and increasing as the vacuum increases. On this scale no vacuum would be indicated by 0 psig, and a perfect vacuum would be indicated by approximately 14.7 psi vacuum.  This is called the vacuum scale, this is the gage pressure with the negative sign removed.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;sidebyside widths="60% 35%" margins="0%" valign="top"&gt;
Vacuum Gages use the third method.  Vacuum scales range from zero to thirty inches of mercury. When a vacuum gage reads zero, the pressure measured is 0 psig = atmospheric pressure, or in other words,  no vacuum.  A reading of 29.92 inches of mercury would indicate a perfect (or nearly perfect) vacuum.  In actual practice, it is impossible to obtain a perfect vacuum even under laboratory conditions.

            <Title>Head</Title>
            <Text>You will also find another kind of pressure unit, which appears to be a length. These units include inches of water, inches of mercury (Hg), or the height of some other liquid of known density. These units, while measured in length units, still represent a pressure. The length describes the pressure exerted by a column of liquid of the given height, and is known as the &lt;em&gt;head&lt;/em&gt;. 
For example, a pressure reading of 1 inch of water (1 in. H₂O) means that the exerted pressure is equal to the pressure exerted by a column of water 1 inch high, or that a column of water in a U-tube would be displaced 1 inch by the pressure being measured. Similarly, a reading of 12 inches of mercury (12 in. Hg) means that the measured pressure is sufficient to support a column of mercury 12 inches high. 
What is really being expressed, even though it is not mentioned in the pressure unit, is the fact that a certain quantity of material (water, mercury, etc.) of known density will exert a certain definite force upon a specified area. Pressure is still force per unit area even if the pressure unit refers to the height of some liquid.

            <Title>Introduction</Title>
            <Text>Over the years, many marine engineers have suffered permanent hearing loss due to hours of exposure to the high noise levels in the engine room. You can prevent the loss of your own hearing by using proper hearing protection such as earplugs and earmuffs religiously whenever you are exposed to loud noises. 
Your ear is a delicate instrument which contains thousands of fine hair cells called cilia to detect sounds. Prolonged exposure to loud noises can injure or break these cells or even tear off groups of these cells. Since the hair cells don’t ever repair themselves, when enough of them are damaged, a hearing loss results. 
Short, intense, sounds such as an explosion can cause immediate and permanent hearing loss, but most hearing loss occurs gradually due to prolonged exposure to high noise levels. Most of the time this loss is so gradual that you are not even aware that it is occurring. Hearing loss is progressive and will continue to get worse as you continue to expose yourself to a noisy environment, but if you can avoid further exposure, the hearing loss won’t get any worse. 
Permanent hearing loss is not the only hazard associated with noisy environments. Tinnitus is a condition where a ringing or roaring sound is heard continuously in one or both ears. Tinnitus occurs when the hair cells are damaged in such a way that they produce sound signals to the brain even in the absence of actual stimulation. This noise is sometimes described as like having a cricket permanently stuck in your ear, and is very annoying. 
Sound intensity is measured in units of decibels (dB). The decibel scale is a logarithmic scale in which 0 dB indicates the quietest sound that can be heard by a normal person. A quiet library is about 20 dB. A normal conversation occurs at a sound level of about 60 dB. A lawnmower produces about 85 dB, and at this level you should be wearing hearing protection. Sandblasting or a rock concert has a sound intensity of about 115 dB. At this level hearing damage can occur after only about 15 minutes of unprotected exposure. 
According to OSHA regulations, when the 8 hour average noise exposure is above 85 dB, employers are required to institute a noise monitoring program, provide adequate hearing protectors, and ensure employees wear them. Continual, unprotected exposure to noises louder than 85 decibels for 8 hours or more can be dangerous, and may result in hearing loss. 
You can easily tell if you should be wearing hearing protection. If you find yourself in a situation where it is too noisy to carry on a conversation at arms length, or if you notice that your ears ring or feel plugged for a time after leaving a noisy environment, you can be sure that you should have been wearing your hearing protection.

            <Title>Sensible Heat and Latent Heat</Title>
            <Text>The terms &lt;em&gt;sensible heat&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;latent heat&lt;/em&gt; are often used to indicate the effect that the flow of heat has on a substance. The flow of heat from one substance to another is normally reflected in a temperature change in each substance-the hotter substance becomes cooler; the cooler substance becomes hotter. However, the flow of heat is not reflected in a temperature change in a substance that is in the process of changing from one physical state (solid, liquid, or gas) to another. When the flow of heat is reflected in a temperature change, we say that sensible heat has been added to or removed from the substance. When the flow of heat is not reflected in a temperature change but is reflected in the changing physical state of a substance, we say that latent heat has been added or removed. 
Does anything bother you in this last paragraph? It should. Here we are, talking about adding and removing heat. And, furthermore, we are talking about sensible heat and latent heat as though we had two different kinds of heat to consider. As noted before, this is common (if inaccurate) engineering language. So keep the following points clear in your mind: (1) heat is the flow of thermal energy; (2) when we talk about adding and removing heat, we mean that we are providing temperature differentials so that thermal energy can flow from one substance to another; and (3) when we talk about sensible heat and latent heat, we are talking about two different kinds of effects that can be produced by heat, but not about two different kinds of heat. 
The three basic physical states of all matter are &lt;em&gt;solid,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;liquid,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;gas&lt;/em&gt; (or vapor). The physical state of a substance is closely related to the distance between molecules. The molecules are closest together in solids, farther apart in liquids, and farthest apart in gases. When the flow of heat to a substance is not reflected in a temperature change, we know that the energy is being used to increase the distance between the molecules of the substance and thus to change it from a solid to a liquid or from a liquid to a gas. Such a change is known as a &lt;em&gt;phase change&lt;/em&gt;. You might say that latent heat is the energy price that must be paid for a change of state from solid to liquid or from liquid to gas. The energy is not lost; rather, it is stored in the substance as internal energy. The energy price is &lt;q&gt;repaid,&lt;/q&gt; so to speak, when the substance changes back from gas to liquid or from liquid to solid. 
&lt;figure xml:id="LatentHeat_png"&gt; &lt;caption&gt;Phase Changes&lt;/caption&gt; &lt;image source="images/LatentHeat.png" width="75%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt; 
&lt;xref ref="LatentHeat_png"/&gt; shows the relationship between sensible heat and latent heat for one substance, water, at atmospheric pressure. The same kind of chart could be drawn up for other substances; however, different amounts of thermal energy would of course be required for each change of temperature and for each change of physical state. 
If we start with 1 pound of ice at 0 °F, we must add 16 BTU in order to raise the temperature of the ice to 32 °F. We call this adding sensible heat. To change the pound of ice at 32 °F to a pound of water at 32 °F, we must add 144 BTU (the &lt;em&gt;latent heat of fusion&lt;/em&gt;). There will be no change in temperature while the ice is melting. After all the ice has melted, however, the temperature of the water will be raised as additional heat is supplied. If we add 180 BTU that is, 1 BTU for each degree of temperature between 32 °F and 212 °F the temperature of the water will be raised to the boiling point. To change the pound of water at 212 °F, to a pound of steam at 212 °F, we must add 970 BTU (the &lt;em&gt;latent heat of vaporization&lt;/em&gt;). After all the water has been converted to steam, the addition of more heat will cause an increase in the temperature of the steam. If we add approximately 42 BTU to the pound of steam which is at 212 °F, we can superheat it to 300 °F. 
The same relationships apply when heat is being removed. The removal of 42 BTU from the pound of steam which is at 300 °F will cause the temperature to drop to 212 °F. As the pound of steam at 212 °F changes to a pound of water at 212 °F, 970 BTU are given off. When a substance is changing from a gas or vapor to a liquid, we usually use the term &lt;em&gt;latent heat of condensation&lt;/em&gt; for the heat that is given off. Notice, however, that the latent heat of condensation is exactly the same as the latent heat of vaporization. Only the terms differ to indicate whether a substance is being changed into a liquid or into a gas. The removal of another 180 BTU of sensible heat will lower the temperature of the pound of water from 212 °F to 32 °F. As the pound of water at 32 °F changes to a pound of ice at 32 °F 144 BTU are given off without any accompanying change of temperature. Further removal of heat causes the temperature of the ice to decrease.

The word tapered indicates that these threads are not the same as those on bolts and screws. 

Pipe threads must not only make a strong mechanical connection but also a leakproof hydraulic seal. This is accomplished by the tapered thread form of the male matching the thread form of the female tapered thread and the use of pipe sealant to fill any voids between the two threads which could cause a spiral leak. The bottoms of the threads aren’t on a cylinder, but a cone; they taper. The taper is 1⁄16 inch per inch of length, which is the same as 3/4 inch in a foot.
Because of the taper, a pipe thread can only screw into a fitting a certain distance before it jams. The standard specifies this distance as the length of hand tight engagement, the distance the pipe thread can be screwed in by hand. It also specifies another distance – the effective thread, this is the length of the thread which makes the seal on a conventional machined pipe thread. For workers, instead of these distances, it is more convenient to know how many turns to make by hand and how many with a wrench. A simple rule of thumb for installing tapered pipe threads, both metal and plastic, is finger tight plus one to two turns with a wrench. Torque installation values can be determined per application, but due to the variations involved in pipe joints such as disimiliar materials of male and female threads, type of sealants used, and internal variations in product wall thickness, a standard torque specification cannot be generically applied.
This table shows the distances and number of turns called for in the standard. A tolerance of plus or minus one turn is allowed, and in practice threads are often routinely cut shorter than the standard specifies. All dimensions are in inches.</Text>

            <Title>Atomizing the Fuel</Title>
            <Text>As used in connection with fuel injection, atomization means the breaking up of the fuel, as it enters the cylinder, into small particles which form a mist-like spray. Atomization of the fuel must meet the requirements of the type of combustion chamber in use. Some chambers require very fine atomization, others can function with coarser atomization. Proper atomization facilitates the starting of the burning process and ensures that each minute particle of fuel will be surrounded by particles of oxygen with which it can combine. 
Atomization is generally obtained when the liquid fuel, under high pressure, passes through the small opening, or openings, in the injector or nozzle. The fuel enters the combustion space at high velocity because the pressure in the cylinder is lower than the fuel pressure. The friction, resulting from the fuel passing through the air at high velocity, causes the fuel to break up into small particles.

            <Title>Absolute Pressure (psia)</Title>
            <Text>Absolute pressure is the numerical scale that starts at zero, where zero corresponds to the vacuum of space. Absolute value is elevation dependent, meaning absolute pressure increases the closer one gets to Earth, and continues to increase the further one travels towards Earth’s center. For example, absolute pressure at sea level is 14.7 psia. In Death Valley, which is below sea level, absolute pressure is 14.9 psia. The densities of different liquids will also affect absolute pressure, so the deeper an object is placed in fluid, the more pressure it will experience. Absolute pressure is always greater than the corresponding gauge pressure. 
For shipboard purposes if you are utilizing a gauge, you can simply add 14.7 psi to the gauge reading in psi to get the absolute pressure. For example, a gauge pressure of 100 psig would be the same as an absolute pressure of 114.7 psia.</Text>

            <Title>Procedure</Title>
            <Text>&lt;sidebyside width="48%" margins="0%" valign="middle"&gt;
Lockout-Tagout (LOTO) is a safety procedure used to ensure that dangerous equipment is properly shut down, isolated from energy sources, and secured while undergoing maintenance or repair. The goal of LOTO is to prevent unexpected startup or release of stored energy, which could lead to serious injuries or fatalities for workers involved in maintenance or repair activities.
&lt;figure xml:id="fig_612524341066_T9-13"&gt;
&lt;caption&gt; Lockout Tag &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;image width="40%" source="images/612524341066_T9-13.png"&gt;
&lt;remix&gt; &lt;source&gt;  https://www.idescosafety.com/  &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/remix&gt;
&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/sidebyside&gt;
Lockout refers to disabling a piece of equipment or machinery by isolating it from its energy sources (electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, pneumatic, chemical, thermal or other), and placing a physical lock on the isolating devices (such as switches, valves, or breakers) that control those energy sources. 
Tagout refers to affixing a label or tag that communicates information about equipment's status and the ongoing maintenance activities. The tag typically includes information about the equipment being serviced, the reason for the lockout/tagout, the name of the authorized person who applied the lock and tag, contact information, and the expected duration of the job &lt;etc/&gt;
The steps of the LOTO process are: &lt;ol&gt;
Identify the equipment or machinery that needs maintenance or repair.
Inform all affected personell that a LOTO procedure will be performed on the identified equipment.
Shut down the equipment using the appropriate procedures outlined in the manufacturer's instructions or company protocols.
Physically isolate the equipment from its energy sources. This might involve locking out switches, valves, or other control mechanisms. In some cases, this can involve disconnecting power sources, bleeding fluids, or other actions to ensure there's no energy flowing to the equipment.
Place a lock on the energy-isolating device to prevent it from being operated. A tag is also attached to the lock indicating who performed the lockout and why. This helps communicate that the equipment is being worked on and should not be operated.
Ensure that any residual or stored energy in the equipment is safely released. This might involve releasing pressure, tension, or any other forms of stored energy.
Verify that the equipment is truly isolated by attempting to start or activate it. This step is important to confirm that the energy sources have been effectively disconnected.
Perform the necessary maintenance, repairs, or servicing on the equipment while it is in the locked and tagged state.
Once the maintenance or servicing is complete, the person who performed the LOTO procedure removes the locks and tags, and the equipment is ready to be safely restarted.
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <Title>Compression</Title>
            <Text>During the compression stroke, the air in the cylinder is compressed to high pressure and temperature. 
At about 35° after bottom dead center (ABDC), the intake valve closes.  The point when the intake valve closes, the air charge is at normal pressure (14.7 psia) and ambient air temperature (~80°F). 
At about 70° BTDC, the piston has traveled about 2.125 inches, or about half of its stroke, thus reducing the volume in the cylinder by half. The temperature has now doubled to ~160°F and pressure is ~34 psia. 
At about 43° BTDC the volume is once again halved.  Consequently, the temperature again doubles to about 320°F and pressure is ~85 psia. 
When the piston has traveled to 3.530 inches of its stroke the volume is again halved and temperature reaches ~640°F and pressure 277 psia. 
When the piston has traveled to 3.757 inches of its stroke, or the volume is again halved, the temperature climbs to 1280°F and pressure reaches 742 psia. 
With a piston area of 9.616 sq. in. the pressure in the cylinder is exerting approximately 7135 lb or 3-1/2 tons of force.  The above numbers are ideal and provide a good example of what is occurring in an engine during compression. In an actual engine, pressures reach only about 690 psia. This is due primarily to the heat loss to the surrounding engine parts.

            <Title>Pilot Generator</Title>
            <Text>Just as the exciter generator is needed to supply the field for the main generator, a third generator is needed to supply the field for the exciter.  This is the pilot generator. 
In other words, the main generator is excited by the exciter, and the exciter is excited by the pilot generator. This process stops here however, because the field of the pilot generator is produced by permanent magnets, not a field winding.  For this reason, the pilot generator is alternately called the permanent magnet generator or the PMG.
The pilot generator is shown in &lt;xref ref="pilot_generator"/&gt;.  It is located at the end of the shaft outboard of the bearing on the non-drive end of the generator unit  .  The rotor carries sixteen permanent magnets of alternating polarities bolted to the rotating shaft.  The stator is bolted onto the bearing housing and carries 3-phase wye-connected armature windings.  The rotating magnets induce a three-phase AC voltage into the stator windings.
The output of the pilot generator is transmitted to the automatic voltage regulator where it is rectified to DC, and then used to excite the stationary exciter field.  
&lt;figure xml:id='pilot_generator'&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Permanent Magnet Generator (PMG)&lt;/caption&gt;

&lt;/image&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;remix&gt;&lt;source&gt;DV951E001_MAIN ALTERNATOR_OPERATION MANUAL_PMG&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/remix&gt;
&lt;/image&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/sidebyside&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Because the source of the excitation in this generator is from permanent magnets, rather than an electromagnet excited by the output of the main generator, the generator is considered separately excited.  The main advantage of separate excitation is that fluctuations in the voltage of the main generator do not affect the excitation supply. Voltage fluctuations can be quickly corrected and the generator output can be maintained within tight tolerances..

Good monitoring may also give you advanced notice of problems before the alarm sounds. Finally, some problems will only be found by making good rounds  &lt;emdash/&gt;  leaks, for example.
It is important to correctly identify the root cause of the casualty.  The alarm you receive may only be a symptom of the true problem.

            <Title>Switchboards and Load centers</Title>
            <Text>A switchboard is an electrical enclosure containing the equipment that monitors, controls, protects, and distributes electrical power. It divides the electrical system into separate circuits and provides a central point from which electrical power can be managed and routed to different areas or equipment.
Within the switchboard, electrical current is carried by a bus or bus bar, not by wires or cables. In an electrical system, a bus refers to a conducting bar or strip that serves as a common connection point for multiple electrical circuits.  It's like a highway for electrical current to flow to different destinations. Buses are typically made of  copper must have sufficient cross-sectional area to handle the required current.
The training ship has two high voltage main switchboards (HVMSB);  Switchboard one is located in the forward engine room, and switchboard two is the after engine room.  Each switchboard is divided into two connected buses:  Switchboard one contains buses one and two, switchboard two contains buses three and four.  The buses are interconnected with circuit breakers to permit the power to be re-routed in an emergency. 
The bus bars are connected through circuit breakers to directly supply to some of the major electrical consumers, and also supply load centers.  Load centers are smaller switchboard or electrical panels located around the ship that contain their own bus and further distribute power to smaller, nearby electrical consumers.  Load centers may also be called group-control centers, distribution boards, or power panels.
The NSMV power distribution system consists of the following: &lt;ul&gt;
2 HV switchboards (6.6kV) Supply power to the propulsion motors, bow and stern thrusters, and supply the low voltage switchboards.
2 LV switchboards (450V) Primarily supply the engine room machinery, and also lower voltage load centers and distribution boards.
1 Emergency switchboard (450/120V). This switchboard normally powered by the LV switchboard, but in the event of a power failure will be isolated and powered by the emergency generator.
4 LV load center panels (440V) Supply power to other machinery, including the galley and laundry equipment, and downstream distribution boards.
4 120 V load center panels (120V) Supply power to 120 V distribution boards, including galley and laundry.
3 Emergency load center panels (440V) Provide power to vital 440 volt loads.
3 Emergency load center panels (120V) Provide power to vital 120 volt loads,
16 Distribution boards (440V)  Provide power to non-vital 440 volt loads.
18 Distribution boards (120/240V) Provide power to non-vital 120 and 240 volt loads,
24 Lighting distribution boards (120V), provide the majority of ship’s lighting and outlets.
13 Emergency Lighting distribution boards (120V), supply the &lt;q&gt;E&lt;/q&gt; lights which sufficient lighting to safely evacuate the ship in an emergency.

&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Standard elbows are available in 90&lt;degree/&gt;  , 45&lt;degree/&gt; and less commonly 22.5&lt;degree/&gt; angles.  A 90&lt;degree/&gt; Ell is also called a quarter-bend.   
Standard elbows fit the same size pipe and female threads on both ends.  When one end is smaller than the other the fitting is called a reducing elbow (h), and when one end has male threads the fitting is called a street elbow (i).
Short radius elbows have a radius of curvature of about one pipe diameter from center of the bend to the center of the elbow face, while the radius of curvature for long radius elbows is about one and a half diameters. Long radius elbows produce less turbulence in the fluid which results in reduced frictional losses and pressure drop, but they take up more room and are more expensive. </Text>

Each end of the rod is bored, with the smaller top bore connecting to the piston pin (wrist pin) in the piston as shown in  &lt;xref ref="connecting-rod"/&gt;. The large bore end of the rod is split in half and bolted to allow the rod to be attached to the crankshaft. Some diesel engine connecting rods are drilled down the center to allow oil to travel up from the crankshaft and into the piston pin and piston for lubrication.

&lt;/figure&gt;
A variation found in V-type engines that affects the connecting rods is to position the cylinders in the left and right banks directly opposite each other instead of staggered (most common configuration). This arrangement requires that the connecting rods of two opposing cylinders share the same main journal bearing on the crankshaft. To allow this configuration, one of the connecting rods must be split or forked around the other.</Text>

kilogram (kg): One kilogram is approximately equal to \lbm{2.2046}.
Gram (g): The gram is a smaller unit of mass frequently used for lighter objects or more precise measurements. One kilogram is equivalent to 1,000 grams. 
Milligram (mg): The milligram is an even smaller unit used for very small masses, often in scientific and medical contexts. One gram is equivalent to 1,000 milligrams. 
Microgram (µg): The microgram is an even smaller unit used for extremely small masses, especially in fields like chemistry and pharmacology. One microgram is equivalent to 0.001 milligrams. 
Metric Ton or Tonne:  For larger masses, the metric ton is equivalent to 1000 kg.

            <Title>Gauge Vacuum (inHg)</Title>
            <Text>Bourdon Tube Vacuum Gauges are used to measure pressures less than atmospheric pressure with the Vacuum Gauge range from 0 to 30 inches Hg. Atmospheric pressure at Sea Level is 14.7 psia or 101.325 kPa, which corresponds to 0 gauge. When in use and the vacuum increasing, the needle will move towards larger numbers with 29.92 inHg being the greatest achievable vacuum at Sea Level, as per Torricelli’s experiment. 
Vacuum pressure gauges and Pressure gauges, both start at zero-gauge pressure with zero-gauge pressure corresponding to atmospheric pressure. When the vacuum pressure gauge decreases below atmospheric, the vacuum gauge needle will begin to move off zero and move towards 29.92 in Hg gauge, stopping at the reduced pressure being measured. The value of 29.92 inches of mercury (inHg) gauge corresponds to the maximum possible vacuum that can be achieved relative to the atmospheric pressure. 
0 Gauge Pressure = Atmospheric Pressure, 14.7 psia in US Customary Units or 101.325 kPa in SI Units. 
Almost all Vacuum Gauge readings will be somewhere between 0 and 29.92 inHg 
In working with Inches Mercury Gauge readings, it is essential to convert those readings into psia (absolute) values. The converted readings can be used when consulting Steam Tables for additional properties related those readings.

            <Text>A fuel system must also control the rate of injection. The rate at which fuel is injected determines the rate of combustion. The rate of injection at the start should be low enough that excessive fuel does not accumulate in the cylinder during the initial ignition delay (before combustion begins). Injection should proceed at such a rate that the rise in combustion pressure is not excessive, yet the rate of injection must be such that fuel is introduced as rapidly as possible to obtain complete combustion. An incorrect rate of injection will affect engine operation in the same way as improper timing. If the rate of injection is too high, the results will, be similar to those caused by an excessively early injection; if the rate is too low, the results will be similar to those caused by an excessively late injection.

            <Text>Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. It quantifies how hot or cold an object or environment is relative to a standard or reference point. 
The most commonly used temperature scale in the US today is the Fahrenheit scale, abbreviated F. In this scale, water freezes at 32 degrees and boils at 212 degrees. (This only holds strictly when atmospheric pressure equals the average sea level pressure. At high altitudes, water boils at a lower temperature, as anyone who cooks in the mountains knows.) 
Another common scale is the Celsius (also called Centigrade) scale. In this scale, water freezes at 0 degrees and boils at 100 degrees. 
There are also temperature scales in which zero is absolute zero, the lowest possible temperature. (People have gotten close to absolute zero, but have never reached it. According to theory, we never will.) Absolute zero is at -273.15 Celsius, or -459.67 Fahrenheit. 
The Kelvin temperature scale uses the same size degree as Celsius, but has its zero set to absolute zero. 
The Rankine temperature scale uses the same size degree as Fahrenheit, but has its zero set to absolute zero 
The Celsius and Kelvin scales are part of the International System of Units (SI), providing a standardized and widely adopted system for expressing temperatures. Celsius is the more common scale for everyday use, while Kelvin is often used in scientific and thermodynamic calculations.

These formulas allow you to convert temperatures between different scales. It's important to use the appropriate formula based on the units provided or required for a specific calculation or conversion. 
6.6.2 Instruments Used to Measure Temperature 
Various instruments are used to measure temperature in different applications. The choice of temperature measurement instrument depends on factors such as the required accuracy, temperature range, and the specific application or industry. Different instruments are suitable for different temperature ranges and environments. 
Here are some common instruments used to measure temperature: 
Thermometers: are the most common instruments for measuring temperature. They come in various types, including mercury thermometers, alcohol thermometers, and digital thermometers. The basic principle involves the expansion or contraction of a temperature-sensitive substance in response to temperature changes. 
Liquid in Glass Thermometer: This type of thermometer uses a liquid (usually mercury or colored alcohol) sealed in a glass tube. The liquid expands or contracts with temperature changes, and the temperature is read from a scale on the thermometer. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Liquid in Glass Thermometer&lt;/caption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Bimetallic temperature sensors use the differential expansion of two metals to detect temperature changes. These are often used in thermostats and mechanical temperature gauges.

&lt;/figure&gt;
Thermocouple: a temperature sensor made from two different metals joined at one end. When exposed to temperature variations, it generates a small electrical voltage proportional to the temperature difference. It is widely used for temperature measurement in various engineering applications. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Thermocouple&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image3.png"/&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Resistance Temperature Detector: RTD is an acronym used for resistance temperature detector. It is a temperature sensor that allows determining the temperature by measuring the resistance of the electrical wire. This electrical wire acts as a temperature sensor. Basically, in this, there is a metallic wire present and with the increase in the amount of heat experienced by the metallic substance, there is a change (rise) in resistance due to variation in the hotness of the wire. However, the resistance of the wire falls when the amount of heat supplied to the wire decreases. In this way, the change in resistance of the wire either increase or decrease signifies the temperature change and in this way variation in temperature through variation in resistance is predicted.

Infrared (IR) Thermometer: An IR thermometer measures temperature without direct contact with the object. It detects the infrared radiation emitted by the object, converting it into a temperature reading. IR thermometers are particularly useful for non-contact measurements or in hazardous environments.

            <Title>Atmospheric Pressure</Title>
            <Text>Atmospheric pressure is the pressure exerted by the weight of the atmosphere. At sea level the average pressure of the atmosphere is sufficient to support a column of mercury (Hg) 760.0 millimeters or 29.92 inches high. This is equivalent to a pressure of approximately 14.7 psi. This is known as the absolute pressure of the atmosphere, and is indicated by the unit &lt;em&gt;psia&lt;/em&gt; (pounds per square inch, absolute) 
A barometer is the device used to measure the pressure of the atmosphere, so the absolute pressure of the atmosphere is also known as the barometric pressure. When you hear a weather report, this is the value reported. The barometric pressure changes with weather conditions, but for most purposes aboard ship, this fact can be ignored, and we can assume that the atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psia or 760 mm Hg. at all times. Notice, however, that the figure of 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute (psia.) represents the average atmospheric pressure at sea level, and does not always represent the actual pressure being exerted by the atmosphere at the moment that a gage is being read.

            <Title>High condensate salinity</Title>
            <Text>High salinity in the condensate will lead to high salinity in the boiler, which is extremely harmful. It causes scaling and overheating of the boiler tubes, possibly destroying them.  It is usually easily recognized through a salinity alarm, which should not exceed 0.25 grains per gallon.  The *Kennedy* has salinity alarms at the main and auxiliary condenser outlets, CDT, reserve feed tank suctions, as well as at the evaporators. 

High salinity also leads to priming and carryover in the boiler, which is harmful to the superheaters and turbines.  Carryover is indicated by a rapid drop in superheater temperature.

High salinity is usually caused by leaking tubes in a condenser, although it may also be caused by impure make-up feed.  Other possible causes include distilling plant producing impure distillate, leaks into feed suction, or atmospheric drain lines passing through the bilge, leaks in the tank tops over reserve feed tanks, and leaking bottom blow valves on idle boilers.</Text>

            <Title>Low vacuum -- hot condenser</Title>
            <Text>Steam turbines like the main engine and the turbogenerators are designed to exhaust to a condenser operating at a very low absolute pressure, which we usually call a *high vacuum*.  The vacuum in the condenser directly affects the efficiency of the turbine. As vacuum is lost, the turbine will slow and overheat. When the vacuum gets sufficiently low, the turbine should be secured to prevent damage.  

Vacuum and condenser shell temperature are closely related through the properties of saturated steam.  When the condenser starts loses vacuum, the shell temperature rises, and when the shell temperature rises, the condenser loses vacuum.  Either symptom can be the cause of the other.

Condenser vacuum depends on two factors -- the partial pressure of the steam, and the partial pressure of the air (and other non-condensable gases) in the condenser shell.   In fact, the absolute pressure in the condenser is just the sum of these two partial pressures.  If either goes up,  the vacuum goes down. Loss of vacuum can be traced to situations which increase either of these two factors. [Chapter 6][#elwakil]

The partial pressure of the steam in the condenser is simply the saturation pressure of steam at the condensing temperature. You can look it up in the steam tables -- pressure depends on temperature. Anything that causes the average temperature in the condenser to rise will lead to loss of vacuum.  This will occur when the sea temperature rises, or with any problem that leads to a reduction of the cooling water supply.  Overloading the condenser with too much steam will also cause the average temperature to rise, because the condensing demand is greater than the cooling water supply.   Finally, if the condensate level in the condenser rises too high, it will submerge some condensing tubes and prevent them from removing heat, leading to higher average temperatures and loss of vacuum.

The partial pressure of the air and non-condensable gases depends on the quantity in the condenser shell -- more non-condensables means lower vacuum.  Since the condenser shell is under a vacuum and is not completely air tight, some inward air leakage is inevitable. Gases that leak in must be removed or the condenser shell pressure will rise and vacuum will drop.  Furthermore, air and non-condensable gases blanket the condenser tubes which reduces condenser effectiveness, and dissolved oxygen in feedwater causes corrosion the boiler.  

Air removal is the job of the air ejector or on some ships, the vacuum pump.  Excessive leakage will overwhelm the air ejector.  If gases enter the condenser faster than they can be removed, vacuum will be lost, so sources of air leakage must be found and eliminated. Finally, any situation that leads to a reduction in performance of the air removal device will lead to loss of vacuum.  

Any number of operational problems can lead to loss of vacuum, including:

*	Overloaded condenser

	-	Overloaded turbine  -- reduce load.
	-	High sea temperature -- reduce load.
	-	Excessive dumping from auxiliary exhaust unloader -- may be caused by  failure of the unloader, failure or incorrectly set auxiliary exhaust make-up valve, or high auxiliary exhaust pressure.


*	Insufficient cooling water

	-	Sea water pump stopped or tripped -- restart, or cross over from another pump.
	-	Coolant flow restricted with seaweed, mud, sand, silt, marine life in condenser -- shut down and clean the condenser.
	-	Circulation system not lined up properly --  check all valves opened properly.
	-	Condenser shell air bound -- vent the shell.
	-	Vessel has insufficient way on to use scoop injection -- change over to main circulation pump.

*	Flooded hot well

	-	Condensate recirculation valve open too wide -- close or throttle it.
	-	Condensate pump tripped off -- restart or switch to stand-by pump.
	-	Incorrect valve line-up -- check that suction, discharges, seal water line, casing vent line are open.
	-	Condensate leaking back into condenser through an idle pump -- check suction, discharge, and seal valves.

*	Air leakage

	-	Air leaks at turbine glands --  insufficient gland sealing steam, adjust to between 1½ to 2 psi.
	-	Air leaking past turbine glands -- glands are worn, replace at first opportunity.
	-	Air leaking through idle condensate pump -- secure vent on idle pump.
	-	Vacuum dragging from a dry make up feed tank - switch tanks.
	-	Vacuum dragging an empty ADT -- caused by inattention or float level control malfunction, close   drag valve until the ADT refills.
	-	Evaporator feed heater drains open to the atmosphere.
	-	LP drains from first stage heater open to the atmosphere.
	-	LP vent from first stage heater open to the atmosphere.
	-	Casing or condenser shell cracks.
	-	Expansion joint leaks.

*	Air ejector problems

	-	Low pressure air ejector steam -- adjust regulator or cross over to stand-by 600/150 psi reducing station.
	-	Blocked or worn air ejector steam nozzle -- switch to stand-by set and replace.
	-	Condensate water flow inadequate, air ejector condenser overheating --  open condensate recirculation valve,  check condensate outlet valve, check pump.
	-	Condensate loop seal blown out --  refill from condensate pump discharge connection.
	-	Air ejector overloaded -- reduce air leakage.</Text>

            <Title>Introduction</Title>
            <Text>The units of length have changed greatly over time. Long ago, the base of reference was the human body. For example, the cubit was a unit that indicated the length from the elbow to the fingertips.
Length units based on the human body were used for thousands of years. The Roman mile (In Latin &lt;foreign&gt;mille passus &lt;/foreign&gt;, which means &lt;q&gt;thousand paces&lt;/q&gt;) consisted of a thousand paces (of 5 feet each) as measured by every other step—as in the total distance of the left foot hitting the ground 1,000 times, which equals approximately 5,000 ft. 
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Traditional length units&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;image width="50%" source="images/cubit.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
In 1592, English Parliament wanted to standardize the measurement of the mile and made the decision that it should be equal to eight furlongs. Furlongs, which are still used as a unit of measurement in horse racing, are 660 feet long. Thus, the statute mile we use today is 8 \times \ft{660} = \ft{5,280}.
&lt;figure &gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Imperial Standards of Length, Greenwich England&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;image width="50%" source="images/Imperial_Standards_of_Length,_Greenwich.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
This continued until a major change took place around 200 years ago. As the Age of Discovery came to an end and industry grew primarily in Western Europe, it became necessary to unify units of length on a global scale. In the 17th century, discussions were held in Europe regarding the unification of units. After a century of discussions, France proposed the unit of the meter (meaning &lt;q&gt;to measure&lt;/q&gt; in Greek) in 1791. The reference at this time was the distance of the meridian from the north pole to the equator. One meter was set as 1/10,000,000 of this distance. Today, one meter is defined as &lt;q&gt;the distance that light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second,&lt;/q&gt; as defined in 1983.
For navigation on water (marine), air, and space the nautical mile unit of length is used. Historically, a nautical mile was defined as the meridian arc length corresponding to one minute of a degree of latitude. Nautical mile is based on Earth’s circumference being 360 degrees. These degrees can then be divided into 60 minutes. One of these minutes (or minutes of arc as they are called in navigation) along a great circle on Earth represents one nautical mile. Today the international nautical mile is defined as exactly 1,852 meters (6,076 ft; 1.151 mi).
A nautical mile is slightly longer than a statute or land mile. This is because one degree of latitude is approximately 69 statute miles in length, so a nautical mile, 1/60th of that measure, is 1.15 statute miles. 
A fathom is nautical measurement equal to 6 feet or 1.8288 meters. It is commonly used for measuring depth in water, and is approximately the distance from finger tip to finger tip when your arms are outstretched.

            <Text>All events that occur in an engine are related to the location of the piston. Because the piston is connected to the crankshaft, any location of the piston corresponds directly to a specific number of degrees of crankshaft rotation.

When dealing with regular-shaped objects like cubes or rectangular prisms, the volume can be calculated by geometry.  
For large or irregularly shaped containers, the volume can be determined or approximated by various methods.  CAD programs can calculate volume when the object is designed.  For existing objects, a laser scanners can create a three-dimensional point cloud representation of an object's surface. By analyzing the point cloud, engineers can calculate the object's volume with high accuracy.

            <Title>Pipe Nipples</Title>
            <Text>Pipe nipples are short sections of pipe with male threads on both ends. The are used to connect two female threaded pipe fittings.
&lt;figure xml:id="fig_nipples" &gt;

&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Close nipples are the shortest practical pipe nipple. The are used to connect two fittings very close to one another, leaving no unthreaded pipe exposed. Close or nipples are difficult to work with because the threads will be damaged with a pipe wrench, and the are difficult to remove without damage.
Short or shoulder nipples  are longer than close nipples and have a very small section of unthreaded pipe in the middle. However, this unthreaded section is still not large enough to fit a pipe wrench to tighten or remove the nipple without damage.
Hex nipples are short nipples with a hexagonal center section that allows you to securely grasp the nipple with a wrench to tighten or remove it.
Long or barrel nipples  have enough unthreaded pipe in the center to be gripped with a pipe wrench. 
Threaded pipe sections longer than about one foot are not considered nipples.

            <Title>Exhaust</Title>
            <Text>As the piston approaches 48° BBDC, the cam of the exhaust lobe starts to force the follower upward, causing the exhaust valve to lift off its seat. As shown in Figure 20, the exhaust gasses start to flow out the exhaust valve due to cylinder pressure and into the exhaust manifold. After passing BDC, the piston moves upward and accelerates to its maximum speed at 63° BTDC. From this point on the piston is decelerating. As the piston speed slows down, the velocity of the gasses flowing out of the cylinder creates a pressure slightly lower than atmospheric pressure. At 28° BTDC, the intake valve opens and the cycle starts again.

            <Text>Measurement is the process of associating numbers with quantities. Units of measurement establish a common language for engineers to communicate and quantify various physical quantities. There are two basic standard units of measurement systems that are used worldwide, the U.S. Standard Measurement System and the Metric System.
In the world of engineering, measurement is fundamental. Accurate measurements are crucial for designing, constructing, and evaluating systems. Engineers rely on standardized units and principles of measurement to ensure consistency and precision in their work.
This chapter provides an overview of the categories and units of measurement used in engineering systems, covering both the metric and US standard systems as well as nautical measurement. An overview of basic instruments used for making measurements will be discussed along with the principles of measurement &lt;term&gt;including&lt;/term&gt; accuracy, efficiency, percent error and deviation.
As you study this chapter, you will encounter new terms and definitions for you to learn. At the end of the chapter, you will find example problems. Be sure to take the time to practice with these problems. They will help prepare you to apply these concepts.

            <Title>Torque Units</Title>
            <Text>Since torques are the product of a force with a distance, they have units of [force] \times [distance].
In the US standard system, torque is typically measured in foot-pounds (ft-lb) or inch-pounds (in-lbs.). These units represent the amount of force applied at a specified distance from the rotational axis. For example, one foot-pound of torque is equal to a force of one pound applied at a distance of one foot from the axis of rotation. 
In the metric system, torque is measured in newton-meters (N-m) or in some cases, newton-centimeters (N-cm). The newton-meter represents the force (in newtons) applied at a distance of one meter from the rotational axis. Similarly, the newton-centimeter is the force (in newtons) applied at a distance of one centimeter from the axis of rotation.

            <Text>Mechanical hazards are a physical hazards associated with machines and other movable objects that may cause harm to a person.
Injuries caused by mechanical hazards include friction or abrasion, lacerations, cutting, severing, pinching, crushing, or entanglement of body parts. Additionally, non-mechanical hazards such as chips, splashes, and sparks can injure you or others in the area.

&lt;/figure&gt;
Mechanical hazards can be managed by adopting safe work procedures and the application of appropriate safeguards. As such, you should always wear appropriate PPE, follow the machine’s operating instructions, and ensure that all machine safety features and guards are in place. Be aware that some machines may start automatically at any time, so take appropriate precautions including de-energizing and locking out machinery before working on it.

Atmospheric pressure is the pressure exerted by the Earth's atmosphere at a given location. For example, standard atmospheric pressure at sea level is 760mmHg, 14.7 psia or 101.325 kPa. In Denver, Colorado, atmospheric pressure 12.4 psi or about 84.0 kPa, and in Death Valley, California it is 14.9 psi or 102.6 kPa. 
Atmospheric pressure is commonly measured with a barometer. 
One Atmosphere at Sea Level = 14.7 psi, 101.325 kPa and 760 mmHg (1 Torr).</Text>

A digital multimeter (DMM) is a versatile electronic tool that combines multiple measurement functions in one device. Most digital multimeters can measure AC and DC voltages, AC and DC currents up to a few amps, resistance, and perform continuity tests.  Some meters can additionally measure capacitance, frequency, check diodes, and measure temperatures with an optional thermocouple. A good digital multimeter is a valuable tool for troubleshooting electrical and electronic devices.  
&lt;figure xml:id="fig_digital_multimeter"&gt;

&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/sidebyside&gt;
When using a DMM, always ensure that the test leads are correctly connected to the meter; the black lead goes in the common (COM) jack, but the red lead position depends on the measurement you intend to make. Next, select the desired measurement mode with a selector switch to configure the DMM's internal circuitry, and finally connect the test leads to the circuit and make the measurement.   The DMM displays the measured values on a digital screen, showing the numerical value and unit. Some models have auto-ranging, which selects the appropriate measurement range automatically, and data hold functions to freeze the displayed value.
To measure voltage you connect the DMM probes to the circuit across two points of interest.  An analog-to-digital converter (ADC) detects the voltage difference between them and converts it into a digital format which is then processed and displayed. When measuring large voltages, a potential divider circuit proportionally reduces the voltage to a suitable lower value. 
To measure current, the DMM is connected in series with the circuit under test and the voltage drop across a precision internal resistor is measured to determine the current.   However, to use a DMM to measure current you must disconnect and open a portion of the circuit to introduce the meter.  For this reason, DMMs are rarely used for current measurement.
Resistance measurement involves applying a stabilized voltage from the meter’s battery to the component being tested and measuring the resulting current. Using the applied voltage and measured current, the DMM calculates the resistance.
A continuity test is just a resistance measurement used to determine if two points are electrically connected.  Often the meter will produce an audible &lt;q&gt;beep&lt;/q&gt; if the resistance is below a threshold value of 50-100 ohms.

            <Title>High water in boiler -- carryover</Title>
            <Text>High water is as serious as low water, but for different reasons. Low water can lead to boiler damage, while high water leads to turbine damage. If the water level in the boiler drum is too high, moisture will enter the dry pipe, pass through the superheater, and enter the main engine, turbogenerators, or auxiliary turbines. This situation is known as *carryover*.

Carryover is bad for steam turbines. The thermal and mechanical shock of moisture impact on the blades can cause damage to the turbine blades and thrust bearings, and also blow out gaskets and damage connecting steam piping. In addition, the entrained boiler water contains dissolved and suspended solids which will leave deposits on superheater tubes, valves, and turbine blades. Deposits on superheaters tubes cause corrosion, overheating, and tube failure. Deposit build-up on reducing valves, governor valves or throttles can cause them to stick, resulting in loss of control. In the worst case, this could lead to turbine over-speeding. Solid particles in the steam cause erosion of the turbine blades, damaging them and reducing turbine efficiency, and build up on the blades causes rotor imbalance and vibration. [Chapter 16][#GE]

The main indication of a high water situation is given by the boiler high level alarm and boiler gage glass.  Carryover is indicated by a dramatic drop in superheat temperature. Note that a high level in the steam drum will be accompanied by a low level in the DC heater, and vice versa, so when the DC heater is low, check the drum level before taking on make-up feed. Also, a completely full gage glass looks identical to a completely empty one. One way to tell the difference is to blow down the glass, which should bring a high level into view.

High water is usually caused by too much feedwater entering the boiler, either due to high feed pump discharge pressure, or to problems with the feedwater regulator.  

Other causes include boiler *swell* and poor boiler water quality. Swell is a rapid expansion of the steam-water mixture in the drum, caused by a sudden drop in drum pressure associated with an increase in steam demand.  Swell typically occurs during maneuvering, soot blowing, or when boiler safeties pop.  Swell can be minimized by opening throttles gradually.  

Boiler water containing chlorides, high solids concentrations, high alkalinity, or oil contamination promotes the formation of stable bubbles in the boiler water, called foam.  This foam builds up in the drum and allows the contaminants to enter the dry pipe and carry over.   Foam also causes erroneous water level readings and confuses the feedwater regulator. Foaming and the resulting problems can be avoided by proper attention to boiler water treatment.</Text>

It was adopted in 1993 and became mandatory for all vessels engaged in international voyages in 1998.
The primary objective of the ISM Code is to establish a safety management system (SMS) on board ships and ashore, providing a framework for managing safety and minimizing risks in the maritime industry. The code applies to all types and sizes of vessels, including passenger ships, cargo ships, tankers, and offshore drilling units.
Under the ISM Code, both the ship and the company have specific obligations to ensure the effective implementation of safety management systems and adherence to safety standards. The obligations of the ship and the company are as follows:</Text>

            <Title>Other casualties</Title>
            <Text>In this chapter, we have discussed a few of the potential engineering casualties that could occur aboard a steamship.  Here are several more that you should prepare for. 

-	Main or auxiliary condensate pump failure 
-	Main or auxiliary circulating pump failure
-	Seawater service pump failure
-	Main feed pump failure
-	Steering gear motor failure
-	Lube oil cooler leak 
-	High level, main lube oil sump
-	Jammed throttle
-	Turbogenerator trip
-	Overloaded generator
-	Fire, both inside and outside the engineroom

Consider each one, and determine what might cause the casualty, what its effects would be on the rest of the plant, and what actions you would take to correct the situation.  It is important to know more than just *what* you plan to do, you must also know precisely *how* you are going to do it -- where are the valves, power supplies, crossovers, etc?</Text>

            <Title>Introduction</Title>
            <Text>Diesel engine speed is controlled solely by the amount of fuel injected into the engine by the injectors. Because a diesel engine is not self-speed-limiting, it requires not only a means of changing engine speed (throttle control) but also a means of maintaining the desired speed. The governor provides the engine with the feedback mechanism to change speed as needed and to maintain a speed once reached. 
A governor is essentially a speed-sensitive device, designed to maintain a constant engine speed regardless of load variation. Since all governors used on diesel engines control engine speed through the regulation of the quantity of fuel delivered to the cylinders, these governors may be classified as speed-regulating governors. As with the engines themselves there are many types and variations of governors. In this module, only the common mechanical-hydraulic type governor will be reviewed. 
The major function of the governor is determined by the application of the engine. In an engine that is required to come up and run at only a single speed regardless of load, the governor is called a constant-speed type governor. If the engine is manually controlled, or controlled by an outside device with engine speed being controlled over a range, the governor is called a variable- speed type governor. If the engine governor is designed to keep the engine speed above a minimum and below a maximum, then the governor is a speed-limiting type. The last category of governor is the load limiting type. This type of governor limits fuel to ensure that the engine is not loaded above a specified limit. Note that many governors act to perform several of these functions simultaneously.</Text>

            <Title>Type APE</Title>
            <Text>Type APE pumps are assembled with all the individual cylinder plungers in a single housing. The left side of &lt;xref ref="bosch-ape"/&gt; shows the pump assembly for a 6-cylinder engine. The injection pumps are operated from a single camshaft in the bottom part of the housing. The cams dip into lubricating oil and brush against felt cushions at the bottom of each revolution. At the top of each revolution, the cams force the spring-loaded plungers up against the plunger spring resistance. 
Each plunger moves up and down in a barrel which contains fuel oil at the supply pressure. 
The plunger traps oil above it during part of the upward stroke and forces it through the delivery valve and· high pressure tubing to the injector nozzle, where it is injected into the combustion chamber. The action of the plunger, control rack, delivery valve, and injector nozzle are the same in both APE and APF types of pumps. 
By studying &lt;xref ref="bosch-ape"/&gt;, you can obtain a better understanding of the fuel injection mechanism and the control of the amount of fuel injected. The fuel oil sump is filled with clean oil from the supply pump and fuel oil filter. Oil enters the barrel above the plunger through a pair of ports. The amount of fuel forced out through the­ injector nozzle of each upward stroke of the plunger depends on how the plunger is rotated. In &lt;xref ref="bosch-ape"/&gt;, notice that the control rack has teeth all along the side, meshing with a gear segment on each pump. Lengthwise movement of the control rack rotates all the plungers the same amount and in the same direction.

            <Title>Oil record book</Title>
            <Text>Cargo and passenger ships are required maintain an *Oil Record Book Part I (Machinery Space Operations)* by Federal [33CFR151.25][#CFR] and MARPOL 73/78 regulations. The Oil Record Book contains a record of all movements of oil or oily water that occurs aboard the vessel.  Tankers are subject to different, more extensive rules, and must maintain Part I and also Part II (Cargo/Ballast Operations).

Oil Record Book are available from the Coast Guard Marine Safety Office or Marine Inspection Office. The latest version of the ORB is Revision 11-16.  You should always use an up-to-date ORB, because older versions do not reflect the current laws.  Even though the ORB is used aboard the ship, it technically remains the property of the U.S. Government.

You must make an entry in the Oil Record Book whenever any of the following machinery space operations take place:  

-	ballasting or cleaning of fuel oil tanks,
-	discharge of dirty ballast or cleaning water from fuel oil tanks,
-	disposal of oily residues (sludge),
-	discharge overboard or disposal otherwise of bilge water that has accumulated in machinery spaces, or
-	emergency, accidental or other exceptional discharge of oil or oily mixture.

The law establishes several requirements for maintaining an Oil Record Book. ORB entries must be fully recorded without delay after each operation. Each completed operation must be signed by the person in charge of the operation, and each completed page signed by the master. The ORB must be kept aboard for a period of at least three years, and readily available for inspection at all times.   Legally the ORB is the responsibility of the Master of the vessel, but the day-to-day entries will be made by the engineering watch officer. 

Maintenance of the Oil Record Book is serious.  Here is a recent press release from the US Environmental Protection Agency.

&gt;(10/13/05) A.P. Moller-Maersk, A/S, of Denmark, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to pay a half million dollar fine on Sept. 26 by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Moller-Maersk, which operates a fleet of more than 200 vessels worldwide, was also ordered to develop and implement a fleet-wide environmental compliance program. The investigation began on May 25, 2004, when members of the Coast Guard Marine Safety Office discovered waste oil in the overboard piping of the Motor Vessel Jane Maersk during a routine inspection. Further investigation by the Coast Guard and EPA's Criminal Investigation Division also uncovered evidence of false entries in the ship's Oil Record Book. The false entries in the book concerned the operation of the ship's incinerator which, in part, is used to burn waste oil sludge. In a related court action, Johnnie Nielsen of Copenhagen, Denmark, who is the ship's second engineer was sentenced to four months' community confinement for his role in concealing and destroying key documents in anticipation of the Coast Guard inspection of the Jane Maersk. Nielsen further admitted that he had observed engineers on other Moller-Maersk vessels hiding the same key documents prior to pending inspections. Failing to properly maintain an Oil Record Book is a violation of the MARPOL Treaty, which is designed to prevent pollution from vessels that can, among other things, represent a threat to fish and other aquatic life. The case was investigated by the U.S. Coast Guard Investigative Service and the San Francisco Office of EPA's Criminal Investigation Division with assistance from the Coast Guard Pacific Judge Advocate General's Office. It was prosecuted by the U.S. attorney's office in San Francisco.[][#EPA]</Text>

            <Title>Turbines</Title>
            <Text>The simplified steam cycle uses a single turbine to extract power from the steam, but most ships use two turbines to do the same job. Two shorter turbine shafts are more advantageous than one large shaft for several reasons, including reduced manufacturing cost and increased flexibility in the arrangement of machinery in the engine room.
The first of these two turbines is known as the high pressure turbine (HP) and the second is the  low pressure turbine  (LP). A steam line, called the crossover carries steam from the outlet of the HP turbine to the inlet of the LP turbine. A set of reduction gears are used to reduce the turbine speed to the shaft and propellor speed.

&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Superheated steam from the throttles enters the HP turbine where its pressure drops and its thermal energy is converted to mechanical energy. The LP turbine follows the HP turbine and continues to extract energy from the steam. The steam enters at a low pressure (a vacuum actually, at low loads) and exits at an even lower pressure into the main condenser. The specific volume of steam at these low pressures is large, which means that the turbine blades and the LP turbine itself are also large. When looking at the two turbines, it is always easy to identify the LP turbine because of its size; eight to ten feet in diameter is not unusual.
The forward end of the LP Turbine rotor contains the Astern Elements. These are two or three rows of blades designed to rotate the shaft in the astern direction. Since there are so few rows of astern blades, the power the turbine is capable of producing in the astern direction is limited.
The HP and LP turbines and the reduction gear together are known as the Main Engine.

            <Text>Manometers
Pressure can be measured directly by measurement of the applied force. 
Before mechanical manometers and electronic diaphragm pressure sensors were invented, pressure was measured by liquid manometers with mercury or water. 
Mercury (abbreviated Hg) heavier liquid metal 
Fresh Water (abbreviated H20) 
Mercury 
Mercury is a useful material to use in a manometer because of its high density. This means that a much shorter column is needed compared to water. 
Mercury is commonly used in barometers because its high density means the height of the column can be a reasonable size to measure atmospheric pressure. A barometer using water, for instance, would need to be 13.6 times taller than a mercury barometer to obtain the same pressure difference. This is because mercury is 13.6 times denser than water. 
1 inch of mercury = .491 psi 
1 pound of mercury = 2.036 inches 
1 inch of mercury = 13.6 inches of water 
1 inch of water =.0736 inches of mercury 
A manometer is a simple instrument used to measure pressure differences in a fluid. It typically involves a column of liquid, and the pressure difference causes a change in the liquid's height, which can be measured to determine the pressure, dependent upon the liquid’s density. 
A U-tube manometer is probably the most common manometer in use today. These devices typically use a column of liquid to indicate the pressure difference between two points. Pressure is read on a scale as the difference in height (h) between the two liquid columns. The units of measure commonly used are inches of water and inches of mercury. 
Measuring pressure 
In a U-tube manometer the tube is filled until both sides are approximately half full. When the pressures are equal, the column of liquid on each side will be at the same height. This is usually marked as zero on a scale. 
With both sides of the manometer open to the atmosphere, the fluid level on one side will be the same as the level on the other side because P1 equals P2. 
U-tube manometer 
Now suppose one end of the U-tube manometer is connected to an unknown pressure P1 whose value must be determined. The other end is left exposed to the atmospheric pressure, P2. 
The difference in the height of the liquid on the two sides of the tube is the differential pressure. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;U-tube manometer utilizing water&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image11.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
The total difference in liquid height is 4 units, which means that our pressure differential is 4 inches of water column. 
Figure 1. With both ends of the tube open, the liquid is at the same height in each leg. 
Figure 2. When positive pressure is applied to one leg, the liquid is forced down in that leg and up in the other. The difference in height, “h,” which is the sum of the readings above and below zero, indicates pressure. 
Figure 3. When a vacuum is applied to one leg, the liquid rises in that leg and falls in the other. The difference in height, “h,” which is the sum of the readings above and below zero, indicates the amount of the vacuum. 
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Types of fluids 
As we said earlier, a manometer is filled with a liquid. Typical manometer liquids are mercury, water, and light oils. 
It’s worth saying here that mercury was a common manometer fluid in the past, but has largely been replaced due to its environmental and health hazards. 
Quite often the liquid is colored to help detect the fluid movement. Here, the specific gravity of the manometer fluids must be included to convert Head to pressure. 
Pressure =\frac{HeadXS.G}{2.31}

            <Text>Every day more than 1,000 eye injuries occur in American workplaces. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics found that three out of five workers who suffered eye injuries were not wearing eye protective equipment at the time of the accident, and when asked why, the victims often claimed that eye protection was not normally used in their type of work, or it was not required for the type of work performed at the time of the accident. Eye protection can save your sight, but you must be wearing it. 
Eye injuries can occur in many ways, but are primarily caused by rapidly flying objects. The BLS found that almost 70% of eye injuries were caused by flying or falling objects or sparks striking the eye. Most of these objects were smaller than a pin head, and were traveling faster than a hand-thrown object. Another 20% of eye injuries were caused by chemicals, and the remainder due to miscellaneous causes such as objects swinging into the eye, pulled into the eye or by light radiation.
Eye injuries can be prevented by wearing effective eye protection. To be effective, the eyewear must be of the appropriate type for the hazard encountered and properly fitted. The BLS survey found that 94% of the injuries to workers wearing eye protection were caused by objects or chemicals going around or under the protector. Goggles provide better protection than face shields or safety glasses, but the best protection is afforded when both goggles and a face shield are worn together.

            <Title>TYPE APE PUMP</Title>
            <Text>Type APE pumps are assembled with all the individual cylinder plungers in a single housing. The left side of figure 7-7 shows the pump assembly for a 6-cylinder engine. The injection pumps are operated from a single camshaft in the bottom part of the housing. The cams dip into lubricating oil and brush against felt cushions at the bottom of each revolution. At the top of each revolution, the cams force the spring-loaded plungers up against the plunger spring resistance. 
Each plunger moves up and down in a barrel which contains fuel oil at the supply pressure. 
The plunger traps oil above it during part of the upward stroke and forces it through the delivery valve and· high pressure tubing to the injector nozzle, where it is injected into the combustion chamber. The action of the plunger, control rack, delivery valve, and injector nozzle are the same in both APE and APF types of pumps. 
By studying figure 7-7, you can obtain a better understanding of the fuel injection mechanism and the control of the amount of fuel injected. The fuel oil sump is filled with clean oil from the supply pump and fuel oil filter. Oil enters the barrel above the plunger through a pair of ports. The amount of fuel forced out through the­ injector nozzle of each upward stroke of the plunger depends on how the plunger is rotated. In figure 7-7, notice that the control rack has teeth all along the side, meshing with a gear segment on each pump. Lengthwise movement of the control rack rotates all the plungers the same amount and in the same direction. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt; 7-7.-Phantom views of APE and APF Bosch fuel injection pumps. &lt;/caption&gt; 
  &lt;image source="images/diesel-image40.png" width="50%"/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
Rotation of the plungers changes the part of the plunger helix that passes over the spill port (on the right side of each barrel in fig. 7-7), thus changing the time at which injection ends. The pumping principle of the Bosch pump is illustrated by figure 7-8, in which four steps of a pumping stroke are shown. In figure 7-8A, the plunger is below the inlet and spill ports. Fuel oil enters the barrel, as indicated by the dotted white arrow, and fills the barrel chamber (between the plunger and the delivery valve). The plunger has a flat top, and the two ports are set at the same level. The two ports are closed by the plunger at exactly the same moment the plunger travels upward. In figure 7-8B, the ports have just closed. The fuel above the plunger is trapped and placed under high pressure by the rising plunger. The pressure forces the. delivery valve up at once, allowing the high-pressure oil to go to the spray nozzle. In figure 7-8C, the plunger is in the effective 
part of its stroke with both ports closed. Fuel is passing through the delivery valve to the spray 
nozzle. The effective stroke will continue as long as both ports remain covered by the plunger. 
At the moment that the spill port is uncovered by the edge of the helix, as shown in figure 7-8D, fuel injection ends. As soon as the port is opened, the fuel oil above the plunger flows out through the vertical slot in the plunger and goes to the low-pressure fuel oil sump. Thus, the pressure above the plunger is released and the delivery valve is returned to its seat by the valve spring. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption/&gt; 
  &lt;image source="images/diesel-image41.png" width="50%"/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
Delivery Valve 
Figure 7-8.-Upward stroke of Bosch plunger, showing pumping principle. 
The effect of ·plunger rotation on fuel delivery is shown in figure 7-9. In figure 7-9A, the plunger is rotated to bring the vertical slot to the edge of the inlet port, which is the setting for maximum delivery. In this plunger position, the lowest part of the helix is in line with the spill port, allowing the longest possible effective stroke before the spill port is uncovered, ending the injection of fuel. Figure 7-9B shows the setting for medium or normal delivery. This brings a higher part of the helix in line with the spill port and leaves a short effective stroke before the spill port is uncovered. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt; Figure 7-9.-Effect of plunger rotation on fuel delivery. A B C&lt;/caption&gt;
  &lt;image source="images/diesel-image42.png" width="50%"/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
 
The position of "no fuel delivery" is reached when the plunger has been rotated to bring the 
vertical slot in line with the spill port (fig. 7-9C). In this plunger position, the fuel above the plunger will not be under compression during any part of the upward stroke. 
The amount of fuel injected can be regulated by setting the plunger in any position between no delivery and maximum delivery. The plunger setting is controlled by the position of the control rack, which regulates all the plungers at the same time. Movement of the control rack, either manually or by governor action rotates the plunger and varies the quantity of fuel delivered by the pump. 
Figure 7-10 illustrates a cutaway view of the Bosch injection pump and control rack assembly. The gear segment is secured to the control sleeve, which is free to rotate on the stationary barrel. The control sleeve has a slot at the bottom into which fits the plunger flange. The flange moves in the slot as the plunger moves up and down. When the control rack is moved lengthwise, the gear segment and the control sleeve rotate around the outside of the barrel. The plunger flange and the plunger (inside the barrel) follow the rotation of the control sleeve. · 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt; 7-10.-Bosch injection pump and control rack assembly &lt;/caption&gt; 
  &lt;image source="images/diesel-image43.png" width="50%"/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
The Bosch plunger, shown in figures 7-8, 7-9, and 7-10, has a flat top surface and has only 
a lower helix. With this type of plunger, fuel injection will always begin at the same point in the piston cycle, whether it is set for light load or heavy load. Injection begins when the ports are closed; the end of injection can be varied by plunger rotation. This type of plunger is used in pumps marked "Timed for port closing." Injection has a constant beginning and variable ending.

            <Text>Sudden loss of fuel oil pressure is most caused by  mechanical or electrical failure of the fuel oil service pump. In this event, the fires will go out, the fuel oil solenoids will close, and the fuel oil manifold pressure will be low or zero.  If the fires can not be restored quickly, loss of boiler pressure, turbogenerators and propulsion will follow.

Other causes of low fuel oil pressure include:

-	Loss of suction due to an empty settling tank.
-	Loss of suction due to a clogged suction strainer.
-	Loss of suction due to high fuel viscosity -- settler too cold.
-	Low discharge pressure due to fuel pump vapor-bound -- settler too hot.
-	Low discharge pressure due to open recirculation valve.
-	Low manifold pressure due to clogged discharge strainers.

            <Title>Impedance</Title>
            <Text>With alternating current, the electron flow is opposed not only by the resistance but also by an additional factor, the reactance. Reactance is caused by the response of the circuit to the cyclic fluctuations of the alternating current and voltage, and may be further categorized as inductive reactance or capacitive reactance. The sum of the resistance and the reactance is the &lt;term&gt;impedance&lt;/term&gt;
 Z, and has units of ohms. Impedance is defined as: &lt;me&gt;Z= E/I&lt;/me&gt;

The magnitude of the impedance depends on factors that include the characteristics of the components in the circuit and the frequency of the current.
Impedance is a measure of the opposition that an electrical circuit offers to the flow of alternating current (AC). It encompasses both resistance and reactance and is represented by the symbol "Z." Impedance takes into account both the magnitude and phase relationship between voltage and current in an AC circuit.

Impedance is most commonly associated with components like resistors, capacitors, and inductors in AC circuits. Each of these components contributes to the overall impedance of the circuit in a unique way:

1. **Resistance (R):** This is the opposition to the flow of current in a circuit due to the frictional effects of the circuit elements. It remains constant regardless of the frequency of the AC signal.

2. **Reactance (X):** Reactance is the opposition to current flow caused by the presence of reactive components like capacitors (capacitive reactance, XC) and inductors (inductive reactance, XL). Unlike resistance, reactance changes with the frequency of the AC signal.

Impedance is the vector sum of resistance and reactance:
\[ Z = R + jX \]

where "j" represents the imaginary unit, indicating the phase difference between voltage and current due to reactance.

In the case of a purely resistive circuit (no reactive components), the impedance is equal to the resistance:
\[ Z = R \]

In circuits with both resistive and reactive components, the impedance is a combination of resistance and reactance. The magnitude of impedance is given by:
\[ |Z| = \sqrt{R^2 + X^2} \]

Impedance is used to analyze AC circuits in a manner similar to how resistance is used in DC circuits. It plays a crucial role in determining the behavior of circuits, including voltage/current relationships, power consumption, and phase relationships. Impedance matching, a technique used to optimize power transfer between components, is important in various applications, such as audio systems, radio frequency communication, and power distribution networks.
Resistance (R) and impedance (Z) are related concepts in electrical circuits, especially in the context of alternating current (AC) circuits. While resistance represents the opposition to the flow of current in a circuit, impedance takes into account both resistance and reactance (opposition due to reactive components like capacitors and inductors). The relationship between resistance and impedance can be understood as follows:

1. **Resistance (R):** Resistance is the opposition to the flow of electric current in a circuit, typically caused by the frictional effects of the circuit's components. In a purely resistive component, the voltage and current are in phase with each other, meaning they peak and trough at the same time.

2. **Impedance (Z):** Impedance is a broader concept that includes both resistance and reactance. Reactance accounts for the phase shift between voltage and current in reactive components (capacitors and inductors) due to the storage and release of energy. In a component with impedance, the voltage and current may not be in phase with each other.

The relationship between resistance and impedance can be summarized as follows:

\[ Z = R + jX \]

Where:
- \( Z \) = Impedance
- \( R \) = Resistance
- \( X \) = Reactance

For a purely resistive component (e.g., a resistor), the reactance (\( X \)) is zero, and the impedance (\( Z \)) is equal to the resistance (\( R \)):

\[ Z = R + j \cdot 0 = R \]

In this case, resistance and impedance have the same magnitude, and the phase angle between voltage and current is zero.

In a circuit with reactive components (e.g., capacitors or inductors), the impedance (\( Z \)) is a combination of both resistance (\( R \)) and reactance (\( X \)):

\[ |Z| = \sqrt{R^2 + X^2} \]

The phase angle between voltage and current in a circuit with impedance is determined by the ratio of reactance to resistance (\( X/R \)) and can be calculated using trigonometric functions.

In summary, resistance and impedance are related in that impedance encompasses both resistance and reactance. While resistance is solely related to the real component of impedance, reactance introduces a phase shift between voltage and current, making impedance a more comprehensive measure of the opposition to current flow in AC circuits.

            <Title>Condensation</Title>
            <Text>As stated previously, a large pressure drop across the turbine is required to get maximum energy extraction from the steam. The boiler supplies the high pressure at the inlet to the turbine, it is the job of the condenser to create a low pressure condition at the turbine outlet.
The condenser is a shell-and-tube heat exchanger cooled by seawater. It consists of a large, rectangular or cylindrical sealed shell containing thousands of tubes. A circulating pump forces cold seawater in at one end, through the tubes, and it exits overboard at the other end. Steam exiting from the turbine enters the condenser at the top, condenses on the tube surfaces and drains out the bottom. That is, the steam gives up its latent heat of condensation to the seawater, and returns to the liquid water state. Once the steam passes across the condenser tubes, it is no longer steam. It has condensed to liquid water, and from this point in the cycle is referred to as condensate. Condensate leaves the condenser as a low temperature, low pressure liquid.
Because the condensation is occurring at approximately the temperature of the seawater, the pressure in the condenser will be approximately equal to the saturation pressure of steam at this temperature, assuming that no air or other gases are present. For example, if the seawater temperature is 80 °F, the corresponding saturation pressure would be 0.5073 psia. This is a very high vacuum, and the greater the vacuum, the better the plant efficiency.
The latent heat removed from the steam by the seawater raises the temperature and increases the energy contained by the seawater, and this cooling water is discharged overboard.
It is unfortunate that some of the energy once contained by the fuel, and then passed on to the steam in the boiler, is eventually thrown away with the seawater. Wouldn’t it be better to somehow use this energy to power the ship? Absolutely, but there is nothing we can do about it! The only way to extract more energy from the steam is by having the turbine discharge to an even lower absolute pressure than we do. The only way to do that is to condense the steam at even lower temperatures than we are. But we can’t do that, because aboard ship there’s nothing colder than the surrounding ocean available to reject the heat to. If we decided not to reject any heat to the ocean at all, the pressure in the condenser would build up to the point where it would equal the steam pressure entering the turbine, and without a pressure drop, the steam would stop flowing altogether. There’s no win, but we’re doing the best we can.

            <Text>During the exhaust stroke, the exhaust valves open and the exhaust gases start to flow out of the cylinder. This continues as the piston travels up to TDC, pumping the spent gases out of the cylinder. At TDC the second crankshaft rotation is complete. 
As the piston approaches 48° BBDC, the cam of the exhaust lobe starts to force the follower upward, causing the exhaust valve to lift off its seat. The exhaust gases start to flow out the exhaust valve due to cylinder pressure and into the exhaust manifold. After passing BDC, the piston moves upward and accelerates to its maximum speed at 63° BTDC. From this point on the piston is decelerating. As the piston speed slows down, the velocity of the gases flowing out of the cylinder creates a pressure slightly lower than atmospheric pressure.

 If the pump has a packed shaft and is to operate with a high vacuum on the suction side, open the seal water line to the stuffing box (if fitted with a valve), and the suction vent line to remove vapors from the suction casing. On a high speed boiler feed pump, open the recirculating line. 
 Open the suction valve and close the discharge valve. 
 Prime or flood the pump casing with liquid.

 As the pump comes up to running speed, briefly open the casing vent valve (if installed) to expel any air from the casing. 
 When the pump is up to its normal running speed, open the discharge valve. 
 Check the suction and discharge pressure gages to insure the pump is operating normally and make sure a packed pump shaft has a small amount of liquid leakage. 
 After the pump has run for a little while, check the casing, stuffing box area (on a packed pump), and the bearing housings for excessive temperatures.

            <Text>Pipe fittings are the parts used to join pipe sections together with other system components like valves and pumps to build complete piping systems.
As discussed in &lt;xref ref="pipe-connections"/&gt;, pipe fittings may be welded,  threaded, mechanically joined, or chemically adhered, to name the most common mechanisms, depending on the material of the pipe.  Some of the most common pipe fittings are described in the following sections.  The photos show threaded iron fittings, but similar fittings are available for other materials and connection methods.</Text>

            <Title>By Displacement Characteristics</Title>
            <Text>A  positive displacement pump is one in which a definite volume of liquid is delivered for each cycle of pump operation, regardless of the discharge pressure the pump operates against, and provided the capacity of the power unit driving the pump is not exceeded. 
A non-positive displacement pump is one in which the volume of liquid delivered for each operational pump cycle depends on the resistance to flow in the discharge line. This type of pump produces a force on the liquid that is constant for each particular operating speed of the pump. Pressure in the discharge line produces a force in the opposite direction. When these two forces are equal, the liquid is in a state of equilibrium and does not flow. 
If the discharge valve of a positive displacement pump is completely closed, the discharge pressure will rise to a point where either the unit driving the pump will stall or parts of the pump exposed to discharge pressure will fail. This situation should be avoided. On the other hand, closing the discharge valve on a non-positive displacement pump will cause the discharge pressure to rise to a maximum for that type of pump operating at a specific speed. Nothing more will happen except the pump will churn the liquid trapped in the pump chamber and produce frictional heat in the liquid. 
Most positive displacement pumps deliver liquid in slugs, with no delivery in between, and this causes a rise then a drop in discharge pressure and flow. Pumps equipped with many small pumping chambers generally have overlapping delivery that minimizes this effect. Non-positive displacement pumps deliver a practically continuous even flow for a given operating speed and discharge pressure. </Text>

            <Text>There are several methods used to perform tank soundings.

The sounding tape value is later used in calculation of the final sounding value, which is derived using the sounding table, taking the list and trim of the ship into account and the temperature at which the fluid (specifically for oil) is stored (as density of oil is affected by temperature).

Is it necessary to take soundings of various tanks every day? Yes. 
In some cases, the sounding has to be taken in every watch. A ship is a floating factory with several mechanical systems working continuously. These systems require fuel oil, lube oil and water to operate, and these fluids are consumed from service tanks or sump tanks. The service and sump tanks on a ship need to be sounded every watch to ensure the level is maintained. 
The service tanks and sump tanks levels are maintained by filling them up with appropriate fluid using storage tanks, which are sounded once in a day. 
Methods for taking sounding on a ship 
Certain cargos carried on ships are toxic, hazardous and inflammable, hence various methods are provided on a ship to measure the volume in the tank. Some of the most common gauging methods used on ships are:</Text>

            <Text>A respirator is a face piece, hood, or helmet that is designed to protect the user from a variety of harmful airborne agents. Respirators can protect you from dust and particulates in the air, hazardous vapors, oxygen deficiency, or a combination of these. Respirators are not necessary for routine operations in the engine room, but may be advisable during certain maintenance procedures such as chipping and painting. 
OSHA regulations require that respirators shall be used in the following circumstances: &lt;ul&gt;
Where exposure levels exceed the permissible exposure limit (PEL), during the time period necessary to install or implement feasible engineering and work practice controls; 
In those maintenance and repair activities and during those brief or intermittent operations where exposures exceed the PEL and engineering and work practice controls are not feasible or are not required; 
In regulated areas; 
Where the employer has implemented all feasible engineering and work practice controls and such controls are not sufficient to reduce exposures to or below the PEL; and, 
In emergencies. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Before using a respirator you should be thoroughly trained in its use. Some of the areas that you should be familiar with include: respiratory hazards; respirator selection criteria, limitations, adjustment, fit, cleaning, and storage procedures, etc. The selection of a suitable respirator depends on the hazard to which you are exposed, and the correct respirator cannot be selected without a thorough understanding of the hazard. 
OSHA divides respirators into two categories: Air-purifying and Atmosphere-supplying respirators.</Text>

            <Text>Like the four-stroke engine, the two-stroke engine must go through the same four events: intake, compression, power, and exhaust. But a two-stroke engine requires only two strokes of the piston to complete one full cycle. Therefore, it requires only one rotation of the crankshaft to complete a cycle. This means several events must occur during each stroke for all four events to be completed in two strokes, as opposed to the four-stroke engine where each stroke basically contains one event.

&lt;/figure&gt;

In a two-stroke engine the camshaft is geared so that it rotates at the same speed as the crankshaft (1:1). 
We will describe a two-stroke, supercharged, diesel engine having intake ports and exhaust valves as it passes through one complete cycle, starting on the exhaust stroke.  The engine has a 3.5-inch bore and 4-inch stroke with a 16:1 compression ratio. All the timings given are generic and will vary from engine to engine.

            <Title>Transforming Heat to Work</Title>
            <Text>The energy transformation of primary interest in the shipboard steam plant is the transformation from heat to work. To see how this transformation occurs, we need to consider the pressure, temperature, and volume relationships which hold true for gases. These relationships may be summarized as follows:  
&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; When the temperature is held constant, increasing the pressure on a gas causes a proportional decrease in volume. Decreasing the pressure causes a proportional increase in volume.  &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; When the pressure is held constant, increasing the temperature of a gas causes a proportional increase in volume. Decreasing the temperature causes a proportional decrease in volume.  &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; When the volume is held constant, increasing the temperature of a gas causes a proportional increase in pressure. Decreasing the temperature causes a proportional decrease in pressure.  &lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Suppose we have a boiler in which steam has just begun to form. With the steam stop valves still closed, the volume of the steam remains constant while the temperature and the pressure are both increasing. When operating pressure is reached and the steam stop valves are opened, the high pressure of the steam causes the steam to flow to the turbines. The pressure of the steam thus provides the potential for doing work; the actual conversion of heat to work is done in the steam turbines. The change in the internal energy (as indicated by changes in pressure and temperature) of the steam between the boiler and the condenser is an indication of the amount of heat that has been converted to work in the turbines. 
Since heat is measured in BTU and work is measured in foot-pounds, how can we compare the amount of energy put in as heat with the amount of energy put out as work? At first glance, asking how much heat equals how much work might seem like asking how many lima beans equals playing baseball. However, the problem is not that difficult, since both heat and work are forms of energy. The formula for converting heat to work is  &lt;me&gt;1 \text{ BTU} = 778 \text{ ft-lb}&lt;/me&gt; or, in other words, the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 pound of water 1 °F is the same as the amount of energy required to lift a 1-pound weight 778 feet against the force of gravity.

            <Title>Types of Nipple</Title>
            <Text>A nipple is basically a pipe with male threads on each side to facilitate joining two pipes or fittings with similar female threads.
It is made by cutting threads on both sides of a pipe by die or a suitable process. The nipples may be short or long.
* Hexagonal Reducer Nipple
A hexagonal reducer nipple is a hexagonal shaped nipple with two different sizes of threads on each side.
The purpose of the hexagonal reducer nipple is to connect the pipes of two different sizes together
* Hexagonal Nipple
A hexagonal nipple is a pipe connector with male threads on both sides and a hexagonal nut in between for easy installation and screwing.
Both sides are to be screwed in pipe or fitting having reciprocating female threads.
 *Hexagonal Long Nipple
A hexagonal long nipple is used where the distance between the pipe and the fittings is to be joined.
They are otherwise similar to the hexagonal nipples apart from the length.
* Long Pipe Nipple
A long pipe nipple is similar to a standard nipple but longer in length
It is used when there is more distance between the fittings or when a fitting like a valve is to be put at a distance.
 * Close Nipple
A close nipple is completely threaded
and there is no unthreaded area.
This means that there is no hexagonal nut of plain pipe for putting the wrench. These can be damaged by using wrenches. Therefore, a special tool called nipple wrench, which holds the nipple from inside, is used for fitting.

A nipple is a short piece of pipe that is used as a fitting to connect piping in plumbing applications. Nipple fittings are produced in various materials, although stainless steel nipples are the most common due to their strength and durability.
Stainless steel nipples are usually made with male pipe thread (MPT) connections on both ends, connecting two separate female threaded pipes and fittings. The connection allows for a watertight seal between the fittings.
Stainless steel nipples are primarily used in low-pressure piping systems, and the type of nipple used will vary with the size, temperature, and working pressure of the system. Therefore, depending on the specific application, there are various types of pipe nipples to choose from. This article will outline the uses of different types of stainless steel nipples.
CLOSE PIPE/RUNNING PIPE NIPPLE
A close pipe nipple is a stainless steel nipple that does not have an unthreaded section in the middle. These types of pipe nipples are also known as running nipples. These pipe nipples are designed such that connected fittings come very close to one another, leaving very little of the pipe nipple exposed.
Generally, close or running pipe nipples are difficult to work with as they can easily become damaged upon removal unless specialty equipment is used.
SHOULDER PIPE NIPPLE
Shoulder pipe nipples are longer than close nipples and have a very small section of unthreaded pipe in the middle. However, this unthreaded section is not large enough to fit a pipe wrench to remove the nipple.
HEXAGONAL PIPE NIPPLE
Also known as a Hex pipe nipple, these are designed with a hexagonal-shaped middle section. This allows one to securely grasp the nipple with a wrench to tighten or remove it. This design feature provides a greater mechanical advantage than that of a normally rounded nipple. Hence, hex pipe nipples are used in various applications where nipples need to be regularly removed or replaced.
REDUCING/UNEQUAL PIPE NIPPLE
Reducing or unequal pipe nipples are designed to allow a female fitting with a large connection to attach to a relatively smaller one. These are normally used for piping systems where a change in pipe dimension and flow pressure is necessary.
HOSE PIPE NIPPLE
A Hose pipe nipple is designed with a male threaded connection on one end and a hose barb on the other end. These are normally used for piping systems that require a pipe to be connected to tubing.
WELDING PIPE NIPPLE
A welding pipe nipple has a male threaded connection on one end and a standard cut pipe on the other end. Once the unthreaded end is welded and connected, fitting a pipe to the threaded end becomes much easier. Welding pipe nipples are normally used in piping systems that require welding to connect components.

            <Title>Common Rail System</Title>
            <Text>The basic common-rail system consists of a high-pressure pump which discharges very high-pressure fuel into a common rail, or header, to which each fuel injector is connected by tubing. A spring-loaded bypass valve on the header maintains a constant pressure in the system, returning all excess fuel to the fuel supply tank. The fuel injectors are operated mechanically, and or electrically by the engine computer which controls the amount of diesel fuel oil injected into the cylinder at each power stroke by the lift of the needle valve in the injector. The principal parts of a basic common-rail system are shown in figure below.

            <Title>Motor Control</Title>
            <Text>Next, we will describe the operation of one simple and common motor controller: an across-the-line starter.  It is given this name because the controller connects the motor’s stator windings directly across the power lines and starts it using full line voltage. This type of motor controller is very common, and is worth studying as its basic control circuit is the foundation of many other devices.
The power and control circuits for an across-the-line starter are shown in &lt;xref ref="fig_motor_controller"/&gt;. The circuit consists of two parts: the three-phase power circuit (blue) , which connects the power supply, entering from the left, to the motor, and the single-phase control circuit (black) which is responsible for the control functions. 
The power circuit consists of a circuit breaker (1), three main contacts (2),  three overload sensors (3), and connections to the motor (4). The control circuit consists of two control fuses (5), start (6) and stop (7) buttons, an auxiliary relay, (8), the contactor operating coil (9), and normally closed overload relay contacts (10).

&lt;figure xml:id="fig_motor_controller"&gt;
&lt;caption&gt; Across-the-line starter  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;image width="90%" source="images/motor_controller"&gt;
&lt;remix&gt; &lt;source&gt;whaynes@maritime.edu cc0&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/remix&gt;
&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

The operation is as follows: &lt;ol&gt;
The start button is a momentary push-to-close switch. When it is closed, it completes the control circuit, and energizes the main operating coil. 
The main operating coil is part of the contactor assembly&lt;fn&gt;The contactor assembly consists of the coil (9), and contacts (2), and (8).  When the coil is de-energized, the contacts are held open by a spring.  When it is energized, the coil closes the contacts electromagnetically. &lt;/fn&gt;. When the main operating coil energizes it closes three main contacts  in the power circuit and the auxiliary contact in the control circuit. 
&lt;li&gt;
Closing the main contacts completes the circuit between the power supply and the motor, allowing current to flow directly to the motor's terminals and start the motor.
Since the auxiliary contact is  wired in parallel with the start button, after it closes the start button may be released and the motor will continue to operate.  For this reason, the auxiliary contact is sometimes called the latch contact.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motor will continue to run until one of the following happens:&lt;ul&gt;
The stop button is pressed.  This breaks the control circuit and de-energizes the main coil.  This causes the main and auxiliary contacts to open and stop the motor.
One of the three overload sensors detects the motor drawing high current.  This opens the corresponding overload contact in the control circuit and stops the motor.
A short circuit is detected by the circuit breaker, tripping it.  This secures power to both the power and control circuits and stops the motor.  Fuses will de-energize the control circuit if a short occurs there.
A low voltage condition occurs when the supply voltage drops below about 90% of its nominal value.  If this happens, the current through the operating coil decreases, causing its electromagnet to weaken enough to release the main contacts, which stops the motor.  If the voltage returns to normal, the motor will remain stopped until the start button is pressed again.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
A motor which does not restart after a power failure is described as having Low Voltage Protection (LVP).  The alternate behavior, where the motor automatically restarts after a power failure is called  Low Voltage Release (LVR).  Critical machinery such as the steering gear and lube oil pumps have LVR, while other machines have LVP.</Text>

            <Text> As mentioned previously, in a four-stroke engine the piston will go down and up twice and the crankshaft will make two complete rotations while the engine completes one cycle.
The events occurring during each cycle are shown graphically in &lt;xref ref="four-stroke-timing"/&gt;, which is known as a timing diagram. The timing of these operations are controlled by a camshaft.  In a four-stroke engine the camshaft  rotates at half the speed of the crankshaft. This means that the crankshaft must make two complete revolutions before the camshaft will complete one revolution.  
It's important to keep in mind how quickly these actions to occur. Very little time is available to move exhaust gas out of, and fresh air into the cylinders, to compress the air, to inject fuel, and the fuel to burn. If a four-stroke diesel engine is running at a constant 2100 revolutions per minute, the crankshaft would be rotating at 35 revolutions, or 12,600 degrees per second. One stroke is completed in about 0.01429 seconds.  In the discussion to follow, all the timings and angles given are approximate and vary from engine to engine.

We will now discuss the operation of four-stroke engine as it passes through one complete cycle.    For the purpose of the discussion,  we will assume that the engine is normally aspirated with intake and exhaust valves,  and has a 3.5-inch bore, a 4-inch stroke and a 16:1 compression ratio.</Text>

            <Text>Prevention of boiler explosions is the only practical course of action.

Always conduct a proper purge before lighting off a burner.  Don't attempt to light off if oil has accumulated in the furnace. If the fires are not lit within five minutes of the purge, purge again.  After lighting off, inspect the flame pattern and the stack for peculiarities. After a burner is secured, remove the atomizer to prevent oil leakage into the furnace.
 
Watch carefully for the following danger signs:

*	one or more unsuccessful attempts to light a burner
*	flame failure or sputtering fires
*	fuel odors coming out of the light off port
*	oil leakage into the furnace
*	irregular, streaked smoke, or black smoke that cannot be corrected 
*	white smoke, although some white smoke is normal when the boiler is cold

If any of these danger signs are observed, proceed with caution until the problem is understood and corrected.</Text>

Safety glasses are lightweight glasses that have shatter resistant lenses made of materials like polycarbonate or propionate plastic and often have side shields attached to the side pieces. Safety glasses are designed to stop flying objects such as chips, fragments, sand, and dirt from injuring your eyes. They also can provide laser light filtration to prevent reflections from the laser entering the eye and causing retinal burns. Safety glasses can be purchased with prescription lenses including bifocals if necessary. 
The main advantage of safety glasses is that they are lightweight and relatively comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The provide little to no protection from liquids or vapors, and some flying particles may get around the side shields. 
Safety goggles provide more complete protection of the eye than safety glasses, since they protect against both frontal and side impact. They come in two different types, vented and non-vented. Vented goggles are used to protect your eyes from splashes and flying objects, while Non-vented Goggles additionally protect your eyes from hazardous vapors, mists, and fumes. 
Face shields are designed to augment other types of eye protection and are not meant to be a stand alone form of eye protection. Face shields are used to protect your entire face with goggles on under the shield to catch any liquids that might make it past the shield. 
Welding helmets  are specialized helmets are used by welders to protect their eyes and face from the intense light, sparks, and heat generated during welding processes. They often feature auto-darkening lenses that adjust the shading based on the brightness of the welding arc.
Always wear a welding helmet when arc welding. Your eyes, face, and neck need protection against the burning rays of the arc, and from the splatter of molten metal and slag. To protect your eyesight, make sure the welding helmet has a colored lens with at least a No. 10 shade when welding with 200 amperes or less. And never strike a welding arc before your helmet is in place. Never look at an arc from any distance with your naked eyes while someone else is welding. 
Never chip slag when your eyes (or those of others nearby) are not protected by goggles, an eye shield, or the clear lens of a welding helmet. If fragments of hot slag were to hit the eye, medical attention would be required for their removal, and blindness could result. The risk of permanent eye injury is so great that you should never chip slag from a weld without protecting your eyes.

            <Text>NTRODUCTION 
HDEC 2000 is an automatic voltage regulator for excitation control system of synchronous machine. The unit is designed on the basis of Hyundai’s long period (more than 30 years) experience in design, manufacturing and testing of synchronous machine together with newest digital signal process techniques. 
Besides automatic voltage regulation function, all regulation functions, limiting functions and most of protective functions for excitation system enable the HDEC 2000 unit to be used in a wide range of applications. All of these features are achieved by the combination of reliable hardware design and the optimized software technology. 
SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 
The key function of HDEC2000 unit is the automatic voltage regulation of synchronous generator through excitation current control by means of PID (proportional, integral, derivative) control algorithm. To perform it, the unit provides control software and some different kinds of hardware devices such as PWM IGBT stage, DIOs, measuring devices (AIs), and communication interfaces etc, and the unit also provides most of functions required by user’s application. Simplified Overall IO and internal architecture of HDEC2000 unit are shown in Figure 1-1.

Control Software and Function Blocks 
Control Software containing function blocks is the brain or the heart of HDEC2000 unit. The software controls all of hardware which performs its own task of self diagnosis, measurement, regulation, limitation function, protective function, monitoring and communication. Control software is an executable codes set and stored in nonvolatile Flash memory. 
The function blocks especially perform major regulation functions and limitation functions, and a part of control software. The most of function blocks are designed based on excitation system models of IEEE421.5 standard. 
Excitation Power Flow 
Excitation input power is normally supplied from the excitation transformer connected with generator output terminals or supplied from a permanent magnet generator (PMG). Some case, excitation input power may be supplied from external utility. Excitation output power of HDEC2000 unit is supplied to excitation winding of main machine or exciter machine after rectification and smoothing process through power module (switching IGBT) controlled by regulation output signal (PWM duty) of software function block of HDEC2000 unit. 
Control Power 
No external control power is normally required for HDEC2000 unit since the control power is internally supplied from excitation input power. For few special application, either ac or dc power source may be supplied externally. Control power is used as driving power of each component in the HDEC2000 unit. See Section 3 (Functional Description) and Appendix C (Specification) for more detailed information. 
Sensing Input and Auxiliary Input 
The voltage and current sensing signals for HDEC2000 unit are measured from sensing transformer installed on generator or generator external cubicle. Both of single phase or three phase voltage sensing configuration is supported by HDEC2000 unit. In case of current sensing system, single phase sensing is available and cross current loop sensing is also available. Excitation voltage and excitation current signals are sensed by measuring device installed internally. 
For remote control application by analogue signal, +/-10Vdc, 4 ...20mA or other standard signal is available and the HDEC200 unit also provides the control capability by the analog signal. 
Digital Input and Output 
Most of control Tasks such as excitation on/off, Auto/Manual and Setpoint Adjust are achieved via digital input signal. The HDEC2000 unit provides seven digital inputs for predefined functions and three digital inputs for programmable functions. Digital inputs can be controlled with dry contactor or PLC open collector signal. The HDEC2000 unit provides three programmable output relays and one watchdog relay also. 
Communications 
Three communication ports are provided for initial configuration in the factory (or commissioning in site), for data exchange between HDEC2000 units for redundant system and for remote access. The communication ports consist of RS232 (COM0), CAN (COM1) and RS485 (COM2) ports. 
User Interface 
he HDEC2000 unit provides three kinds of user interface devices which consist of front panel LCD display, LED lamps and key pad (buttons). Most of operating information such as analogue signals, limitation information and fault events are displayed on the LCD display panel. And the unit also provides the capability for configuration of important parameters and some useful operational functions. 
Configuration and monitoring Software 
The Configuration and monitoring software for HDEC2000 unit called HDCM is connected through RS232 communication port on the front panel. The HDCM software provides very useful functions such as parameter configuration, setpoint adjustment, control gain estimation and real time measurement for factory setup and site commissioning.

            <Title>Pipe Size</Title>
            <Text>Pipe sizes in the United States are specified by two numbers:  The Nominal Pipe Size  (NPS) in inches  and the Schedule (Sch.) number.   The European (ISO) equivalent designation is the &lt;foreign&gt;diamètre nominal&lt;/foreign&gt; (DN), where the diameter is given in millimeters. 
In engineering a nominal value is a quantity used for the name of an object.  Nominal values are usually close to, but not the same as, the actual value.   For example a 2\times4 is the name of a piece of lumber with finished dimensions closer to 1-1/2 inches by 3-1/2 inches.  A 120 Volt outlet may provide anywhere between 114 V and 126 V.  Nominal values are a convenient shorthand; a rounded figure easy to use and remember.
The NPS is approximately equal to the inside diameter of the pipe for nominal pipe sizes up to 12 inches;  above 12 inches, the nominal pipe size is equal to the outside diameter.  Nominal dimensions are used in order to simplify the standardization of pipe fittings and pipe taps and threading dies. Pipe fittings with and pipe with the same nominal size are compatible.
Pipe schedule describes the wall thickness of pipes. There are eleven standard Schedule numbers: 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, and 160, with higher numbers indicating thicker walls. The most common sizes found aboard ship are Schedule 40, sometimes called standard weight, and Schedule 80.   Schedule 40 is the lightest weight used for steam applications.  Schedule 40 and 80 pipes are available in the full range of nominal sizes from 1/8 inch to 48 inch.  Other schedules are more limited. 
As the schedule number increases, the pipe wall thickness increases, the inside diameter (bore) decreases and the pressure rating of the pipe increases,  so for example a 1 inch Schedule 40 pipe which has an outside diameter of  1.315 inches and a wall thickness of 0.133 inches, has a bore of 1.049 inches, while a similar 1 inch Schedule 80 pipe has the same outside diameter, but a wall thickness of 0.179 inches giving a bore of 0.957 inch

            <Title>Bore and Stroke</Title>
            <Text>Bore and stroke are terms used to define the size of an engine. As previously stated, bore refers to the diameter of the engine's cylinder, and stroke refers to the distance the piston travels from the top of the cylinder to the bottom. The highest point of travel by the piston is called top dead center (TDC), and the lowest point of travel is called bottom dead center (BDC). There are 180o of travel between TDC and BDC, or one stroke.

            <Title>Introduction</Title>
            <Text>Ships are dangerous places to live and work for many reasons, some general, and some specific to the marine environment.  These include dynamic and unpredictable marine conditions, extended working hours with small crews, hazardous cargos, isolated work settings, and the potential for fire, explosion, collision, and sinking.
Everyone aboard needs to be aware of the potential hazards, actively engage in safety measures, and be prepared to respond to emergencies.  Safety is not solely the responsibility of designated officers or management but is a collective responsibility shared by all onboard. 
In this chapter we discuss some of the hazards you may encounter aboard ship, approaches to managing and reducing risk, and some things you can do personally do to protect yourself, your shipmates, the vessel, and the environment.

            <Title>Body</Title>
            <Text>Piping inlet and outlet connections are fitted to the body 180° apart  only,    similar to the straight globe valve. Piping connections to the body are the same as a   globe valve: threaded, flanged, etc. 
The body has two seats inside facing each other. One surrounds the inlet opening and   the other the outlet opening. The distance between the seats nearest the bonnet opening   is greater than the distance between the seats at the bottom of the valve body creating   a wedge shape between them. The gate is moved down from the bonnet location between the   two seats. It has a machined surface on both sides and has a wedge shape that matches   the two seats forcing it to seal tightly against both seats when it is pushed down   between them. 
The upper part of the body and sometimes the lower part of the bonnet form a large   cavity for the gate to retract into as the valve is opened. Since the gate slides off   the seats sideways, it must be moved more than the full diameter of the seat opening to   be fully open. This is why most gate valves are taller than globe valves of a comparable   size.

            <Title>Speed -1</Title>
            <Text>Speed measures how fast an object is moving through a distance, and it is calculated by the formula 𝑆=𝑑𝑡, where &lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt; stands for speed, &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; stands for distance, and &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; stands for time. This formula calculates the average speed of a movement, and refers to the rate at which an object moves or operates. It is a measure of how quickly something changes position or performs a function over a given period. Speed is a scalar quantity, meaning it has magnitude but no direction. It is usually expressed in units of distance per unit time, such as meters per second (m/s), kilometers per hour (km/h), or miles per hour (mph). 
Speed and velocity are terms that are often used interchangeably. However, in scientific and educational contexts the differences between them tend to be highlighted. This happens because they are two different types of quantities. While speed is a scalar quantity, velocity is a vector. Speed is defined only by its intensity (or magnitude), while velocity needs to have both magnitude and direction addressed. 
The concept of speed is better understood when contrasted with the concept of velocity. 
Speed is a measurement of how fast an object is moving through a path. 
Velocity measures how fast and to what direction is the movement of an object. 
The symbols for speed and velocity differ by the letters used and the notation that represents the type of quantity they are. While velocity is usually symbolized by the letter &lt;em&gt;v&lt;/em&gt; with an overwritten arrow (𝑣→), one can find speed being symbolized by its full name ('speed') or by its first letter (&lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt;). The lack of an arrow over this symbol is an indication that speed is a scalar quantity. 
Types of speed 
Linear Speed: The rate at which an object moves along a path in a straight line. It is calculated as the distance traveled divided by the time taken. 
Speed=Distance/Time​ 
Rotational Speed (Angular Speed): The rate at which an object rotates or spins. It is measured in terms of the angle turned per unit time, such as radians per second (rad/s) or revolutions per minute (RPM). 
Angular Speed=Angle/Time​ 
Average Speed: The total distance traveled divided by the total time taken, without regard to variations in speed during the trip. 
Average Speed=Total Distance/Total Time​

The graph shows that the object covers 20 meters in 25 seconds. Therefore, its average speed is: 
𝑆𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑=𝑑𝑡=2025=0.8𝑚/𝑠 
Instantaneous Speed: The speed of an object at a specific moment in time. It can be found using calculus by taking the derivative of the position with respect to time.</Text>

Note that noon is neither a.m. nor p.m. because noon can never be before or after itself. You can say “12:00 noon”  but this is a bit redundant; “noon” communicates all that is needed.
Midnight is problematic:  What is meant by midnight Friday? It could mean either 12:00 a.m. or 12:00 p.m., depending on whether you consider midnight to be the beginning or ending of the day.  This is why watch bills take effect at 12:01 a.m. and why airline flights leave at 11:59 p.m. or 12:01 a.m. but not midnight.
This confusion can also be avoided by using military time, as described in the next section.</Text>

            <Title>Rankine Cycle</Title>
            <Text>The diagram shown in &lt;xref ref="ts_diagram_fig"/&gt; is an idealized representation of the Rankine Cycle used in the study of thermodynamics, and known as a temperature-entropy diagram. The heavy dome shaped curve is known as the vapor dome and points under the curve are saturated steam, while points to the left of the curve are liquid water and points to the right of the curve are superheated steam.
Feedwater enters the boiler at point 1, and is heated by the fuel. Initially, the water temperature rises, until it reaches the saturation temperature for the boiler pressure, point 1_f, where the water begins to boil. Additional heat added at this point does not raise the temperature any further until all the liquid water is completely vaporized, point 1_g. The heat added between 1_f and 1_g is the Latent Heat of Vaporization. After the steam has reached point 1_g, any additional heat added causes the temperature to rise again, and the steam becomes superheated.
&lt;figure xml:id="ts_diagram_fig"&gt; &lt;caption&gt;Temperature - Entropy Diagram&lt;/caption&gt; &lt;image source="images/ts_diagram.png" width="50%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Superheated steam leaves the boiler at point 2 and enters the turbine. During the expansion process, the steam pressure and temperature both drop as energy is extracted from the steam. Steam leaves the turbine and enters the condenser at point 3, which is saturated or wet steam.
In the condenser, heat is removed from the steam and it returns to the liquid state at point 4. The feed pump raises the water pressure back up to the boiler pressure and the cycle begins again at point 1. The feed pump causes a small temperature rise in the feedwater as well as a pressure increase.
The area under the curve from 1 to 2 represents the heat energy added in the boiler and the area under the curve from 3 to 4 represents the heat rejected to the ocean. The area inside the curve represents the net work done by the cycle.

            <Text>In construction, DC motors are similar to DC generators. The traditional advantage that DC motors have had over AC motors is that, unlike AC motors, their speed can be easily controlled over a wide range by a &lt;term&gt;rheostat&lt;/term&gt;. A rheostat is an easily adjusted variable resistor that can be connected in series with the motor field windings to control field current and, therefore, motor speed. However, solid-state electronic controls like variable frequency converters are now available, allowing AC motors to be operated with variable speed. Consequently, few DC motors are found aboard modern ships.

            <Text>&lt;statement&gt;
Consider the series circuit in &lt;xref ref="fig_parallel_resistors"/&gt;. 
If the battery supplies 100 V, and the resistors are R_1 = 100\ \Omega, R_2 = 200\ \Omega, and R_3= 500\ \Omega, determine &lt;ol marker="A"&gt; &lt;li&gt;The total current I in the circuit, and &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The total current if branch 3 is turned off by opening the third switch.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/statement&gt;
&lt;answer&gt;
For all three branches in operation:  I = 1.7 A. 
For just the first two branches I = 1.5 A.
&lt;/answer&gt;
&lt;solution&gt;
The current in each branch may be found using Ohms Law&lt;me&gt;I = E/R&lt;/me&gt;.
Use Ohm’s Law I = E/R to calculate the current through each resistor.&lt;md&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt;I_1  \amp= E/R_1 =  \frac{100 \text{ V}}{100\ \Omega} = 1.0 \text{ A} &lt;/mrow&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt;I_2  \amp= E/R_2 =  \frac{100 \text{ V}}{200\ \Omega}= 0.5 \text{ A}&lt;/mrow&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt;I_3  \amp= E/R_3 =  \frac{100 \text{ V}}{500\ \Omega}= 0.2 \text{ A}&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/md&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The total current for all three branches is &lt;me&gt;I = I_1 + I_2 +I_3 = 1.7 \text{ A}&lt;/me&gt;
When the switch in branch 3 is opened current I_3 drops to zero, so the total current drops to 1.5 A
&lt;/solution&gt;
&lt;solution&gt;
An alternate solution method is to first find the equivalent resistance using &lt;xref ref="parallel_resistors_formula"/&gt;, then use that resistance to find the current.
For all three resistors &lt;me&gt; R_t = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{100}+\frac{1}{200} + \frac{1}{500}} = 58.8\ \Omega&lt;/me&gt;, and the corresponding current is &lt;me&gt; I =\frac{E}{R_t}= \frac{100 \text{ V}}{58.8\ \Omega} = 1.7 \text{ A}&lt;/me&gt;
Repeating the calculations for the first two resistors only we get &lt;md&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt;R_t = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{100}+\frac{1}{200}} = 66.7\ \Omega&lt;/mrow&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt;I = \frac{E}{R_t} = \frac{100 \text{ V}}{66.7\ \Omega} = 1.5 \text{ A}&lt;/mrow&gt;
&lt;/md&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/solution&gt;

            <Text>BAR 
The bar is defined using the SI derived unit, pascal: 1 bar= =100,000 Pa (100 kPa). =100,000 N/m2. 
1 bar is slightly less than the current average atmospheric pressure on Earth at sea level being 14.5 psia. The bar and the millibar were introduced by the Norwegian meteorologist Vilhelm Bjerknes, who was a founder of the modern practice of weather forecasting. 
One Atmosphere =\frac{USSystem}{MetricSystem} = \frac{14.7psia}{101.325kPa} = .145 
1 Bar = 100 kPa 
100 kPa X .145 = 14.5 psia 
1 Bar =14.5 psia 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;bar Gauge&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image15.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
1 Bar = 100,000 Pa 
1 Bar = 14.5 psia 
1 Bar = 750 torr 
1 Bar= 0.98 atm 
To convert 5 bars to psi, you use the conversion factor: 
1 bar = 14.5 psi 
So, for 5 bars: 
5 bars×14.5psi/bar = 73 psi 
To convert 5 bars to kilopascals (kPa), you can use the conversion factor: 
1 bar = 100 kPa 
So, for 5 bars: 
5 bars ×100 kPa/bar = 500kPa</Text>

            <Text>BAR 
The bar is defined using the SI derived unit, pascal: 1 bar= =100,000 Pa (100 kPa). =100,000 N/m2. 
1 bar is slightly less than the current average atmospheric pressure on Earth at sea level being 14.5 psia. The bar and the millibar were introduced by the Norwegian meteorologist Vilhelm Bjerknes, who was a founder of the modern practice of weather forecasting. 
One Atmosphere =\frac{USSystem}{MetricSystem} = \frac{14.7psia}{101.325kPa} = .145 
1 Bar = 100 kPa 
100 kPa X .145 = 14.5 psia 
1 Bar =14.5 psia

            <Text>WHAT ARE NPT FITTINGS?

NPT(National Pipe Tapered) standard was initially defined for plumbing applications. The metal-to-metal contact in NPT fittings relies on the deformation of the threads to form a secure seal.

		Fittings Learning Center Fittings and Adapters What are NPT Fittings?

Image description: A NPT fitting
NPT or national pipe, or National Pipe Tapered, is an American standard defined under the AMSE B1.20.1. The standard outlines the dimensions and tolerances of tapered threads for pipes and fittings. Unlike straight threads, tapered threads give a more reliable seal, especially when used with a sealant material like Teflon tape. The standard is more than a hundred years old and was initially defined for plumbing applications; however, it has seen effective use in hydraulic and gas conveyance as well.
CHARACTERISTICS OF NPT THREADS
NPT threads are defined by the following features:
	•	The taper angle is 1O 47’ (measured from the center axis of the NPT fitting)
	•	Flat crests and troughs
	•	60O angle between each crest and trough
	•	The outer diameter of an NPT fitting is measured at the midpoint of the taper
	•	Pitch (the distance between threads) is measured in threads per inch (TPI)
SIZING IN NPT THREADS
NPT defines both internal and external threads on fittings that conform to the standard; hence sizing charts give diameter measurements for both male and female parts. As a result, all male and female fitting types have consistency, adhering to the same taper rate – change in thread diameter per unit length. For the NPT standard, the taper rate is ¾ inch per foot or 1/16 inch per inch.
Since the O.D. is measured from the midpoint, confusion may arise when selecting the correct size fitting. An NPT fitting labeled as 1/8” has an actual outer diameter of 3/8”. So be careful when selecting NPT fittings, as you may end up using a fitting that’s too loose. The chart below summarizes the dimensions of some commonly used sizes. Note that some NPT fitting sizes have the same TPI; hence they can be used on each other on account of the taper. 

#
ADVANTAGES OF USING NPT THREAD FITTINGS
Given that the standard has been around for a while, it has a set of advantages when being used. It is readily available in vendor inventories, with multiple sizes and materials to choose from. This allows you to use them for many applications at varying pressures. Moreover, they can be assembled in a simple manner as the metal-to-metal contact offers an excellent seal.
DISADVANTAGES OF USING NPT THREAD FITTINGS
The metal-to-metal contact in NPT fittings relies on the deformation of the threads to form a secure seal. This, however, means that one cannot use them in applications that require frequent disassembly.
If used improperly, that is, without correct alignment, overtightening, or wrong sizing, ports may expand, and cracks may form on the threads. This, in turn, leads to the formation of leakage pathways from where the medium can leak out. It is for this reason that NPT fittings are not recommended for extremely high-pressure applications.

            <Title>Forced draft fan failure</Title>
            <Text>The failure of a forced draft fan will cause the boiler to produce large quantities of black smoke due to insufficient air for combustion.  This will be indicated by an obscured, solid black, stack periscope, or you may hear about it from the bridge.  You will also see a low pressure on the boiler draft gage, the flames will have an unusual yellow-orange color, the boiler may begin to *pant*, and you may smell unusual combustion odors in the engine room. 

Forced draft fan failure is caused by either electrical failure of the fan's prime mover, or mechanical failure of the fan, dampers, linkages, bearings or the like. Electrical failure will automatically close the fuel oil solenoid and secure the fuel supply to the affected boiler.</Text>

            <Title>introduction</Title>
            <Text>Electrical power is the rate at which electrical energy is transferred or converted from one form to another in an electrical circuit. Electrical power can be converted to useful forms such as mechanical power, light, or  heat, with a suitable device such as a motor, lightbulb, or resistor. Electrical power is measured in watts (W) and is represented by the symbol P.  
&lt;definition&gt;&lt;statement&gt;
The watt (Unit symbol: W) is the unit of power the International System of Units (SI).  One watt is the power delivered when one ampere of current is pushed through an electric circuit by one volt of electromotive force, or equivalently 1 joule per second. 
&lt;/statement&gt;&lt;/definition&gt;
The watt is a relatively small quantity, so kilowatts (kW) and  megawatts (MW) are commonly used. One kW is equal to 1000 W, and one MW equals 1000 kW.
To convert between SI and US customary power units, use these conversion factors: 
&lt;md&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt;1 \text{ hp} \amp= 746 \text{ W}  \amp \amp =  0.746 \text{ kW} &lt;/mrow&gt; 
&lt;mrow&gt;1 \text{ kW}\amp =  1.340 \text{ hp} \amp \amp= 3412 \text{ Btu/hr}&lt;/mrow&gt;

            <Title>Crankshaft</Title>
            <Text>The crankshaft transforms the linear motion of the pistons into a rotational motion that is transmitted to the load. Crankshafts are made of forged steel. The forged crankshaft is machined to produce the crankshaft bearing and connecting rod bearing surfaces. The rod bearings are eccentric, or offset, from the center of the crankshaft as illustrated in Figure 7. This offset converts the reciprocating (up and down) motion of the piston into the rotary motion of the crankshaft. The amount of offset determines the stroke (distance the piston travels) of the engine (discussed later). 
The crankshaft does not ride directly on the cast iron block crankshaft supports, but rides on special bearing material as shown in Figure 7. The connecting rods also have bearings inserted between the crankshaft and the connecting rods. The bearing material is a soft alloy of metals that provides a replaceable wear surface and prevents galling between two similar metals (i.e., crankshaft and connecting rod). Each bearing is split into halves to allow assembly of the engine. The crankshaft is drilled with oil passages that allow the engine to feed oil to each of the crankshaft bearings and connection rod bearings and up into the connecting rod itself. 
The crankshaft has large weights, called counter weights, that balance the weight of the connecting rods. These weights ensure an even (balance) force during the rotation of the moving parts.

Replace the broken glass according to the manufacturer's instructions, and use this unit as a spare for the next time. Failure to tighten gage glass nuts and warm up the gage correctly will cause the new glass to fail and leak.

            <Title>Intake</Title>
            <Text>As the piston moves upward and approaches 28° before top dead center (BTDC), as measured by crankshaft rotation, the camshaft lobe starts to lift the cam follower. This causes the pushrod to move upward and pivots the rocker arm on the rocker arm shaft. As the valve lash is taken up, the rocker arm pushes the intake valve downward and the valve starts to open. The intake stroke now starts while the exhaust valve is still open. The flow of the exhaust gasses will have created a low pressure condition within the cylinder and will help pull in the fresh air charge as shown in Figure 16. The piston continues its upward travel through top dead center (TDC) while fresh air enters and exhaust gasses leave. At about 12° after top dead center (ATDC), the camshaft exhaust lobe rotates so that the exhaust valve will start to close. The valve is fully closed at 23° ATDC. This is accomplished through the valve spring, which was compressed when the valve was opened, forcing the rocker arm and cam follower back against the cam lobe as it rotates. The time frame during which both the intake and exhaust valves are open is called valve overlap (51° of overlap in this example) and is necessary to allow the fresh air to help scavenge (remove) the spent exhaust gasses and cool the cylinder. In most engines, 30 to 50 times cylinder volume is scavenged through the cylinder during overlap. This excess cool air also provides the necessary cooling effect on the engine parts. As the piston passes TDC and begins to travel down the cylinder bore, the movement of the piston creates a suction and continues to draw fresh air into the cylinder.

            <Text>Factors such as pressure, temperature, flow rates, material compatibility, and safety standards must be considered when designing piping systems.

The material chosen for a pipe depends on factors such as the fluid being transported, temperature and pressure conditions, corrosion considerations, cost, and regulatory requirements.
1. **Carbon Steel:** Carbon steel pipes are widely used  due to their strength and cost-effectiveness. However, carbon steel is susceptible to corrosion in marine environments, so protective coatings or regular maintenance are necessary.
4. **Nickel Alloys:** Nickel alloys, such as Monel and Inconel, are used in ship systems where resistance to high temperatures, corrosion, and stress is required. These alloys are often used in systems that handle harsh chemicals or high-temperature fluids.
2. **Stainless Steel:** Stainless steel has excellent corrosion resistance. Different grades of stainless steel are used depending on the level of corrosion resistance required and the specific fluids being transported. 
3. **Copper:** Copper has good corrosion resistance and good heat transfer characteristics, so is suitable for some heat exchangers.
7. **Brass:** Brass pipes are used in certain ship systems due to their corrosion resistance, especially in areas where saltwater exposure is frequent. They are commonly used in small-scale plumbing and valve systems.

            <Title>Reciprocating Pumps</Title>
            <Text>In reciprocating pumps, a power source drives a piston or plunger back and forth in a cylinder. This action pushes liquid out into the discharge on the discharge stroke, and draws liquid into the cylinder, from the source of supply, on the suction stroke. For each stroke, the same quantity of liquid enters and leaves the cylinder. The fluid flow through the pump is controlled by two check valves, one in the suction line and the other in the discharge line of the pump. 
 &lt;xref ref="recip_pump_png"/&gt; shows a steam driven reciprocating pump. The steam piston (7) is driven up and down by steam, delivering power to the liquid piston, or   (69), which pumps the liquid. When the liquid piston (69) is moved down, the area above the piston is on a suction stroke. As the piston moves down in cylinder (72), the increase in cylinder volume causes a decrease in cylinder pressure. When the pressure in the cylinder drops below atmospheric pressure (creating a vacuum in the cylinder), the atmospheric pressure on the liquid in the suction tank forces the liquid up the suction pipe, through suction valve (85) and into the cylinder. Atmospheric pressure plus the liquid pressure in the discharge pipe create a pressure higher than the pressure in the cylinder. This holds the discharge valve (84) closed. When the piston begins to move up on the discharge stroke, a decrease in cylinder volume occurs, attempting to compress the liquid. This results in an increase in liquid pressure in the cylinder. As soon as the cylinder pressure exceeds the pressure in the suction pipe, the suction valve (85) is forced closed. As the piston continues to move up, the liquid pressure in the cylinder continues to rise. When the liquid pressure in the cylinder exceeds the pressure in the discharge pipe, the discharge valve (84) opens and fluid flows from the cylinder into the discharge line. This process repeated many times can build up a considerable discharge head (pressure) on the discharge side of the pump.

Reciprocating pumps are classified as positive displacement, self-priming and most are constant delivery, except for some specialized hydraulic pumps. Reciprocating pumps are additionally classified by the characteristics in &lt;xref ref="recip-terms"/&gt;
&lt;list xml:id="recip-terms"&gt;&lt;title&gt;Reciprocating Pump Terminology&lt;/title&gt;&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Bore&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bore is the inside diameter (ID) of the cylinder, usually measured in inches.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;title&gt;Stroke&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stroke of a pump is the maximum distance the piston can travel from one end of the cylinder to the other, usually measured in inches. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Single stroke&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt; The motion of the piston from one extreme to the other. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Double stroke&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt; The motion of the piston from one end of the cylinder to the other and back to its original starting point. It is equal in distance to two single strokes. It is also a complete operating cycle for that piston (piston has returned to its original starting point and now the cycle repeats.) &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Single-acting&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt; A single acting pump uses only one side of the piston to pump liquid. It is normally the side not attached to the piston rod or the connecting rod. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Double-acting&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt; A double acting pump is fitted with suction and discharge valves on both sides of the piston, allowing the piston to pump liquid on both strokes of the pump cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Direct-acting&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt; The engine used is a steam reciprocating engine. The steam piston is pushed back and forth in the steam cylinder and the rod attached to the steam piston extends into the liquid cylinder and is directly attached to the liquid piston in the reciprocating pump. The engine produces the mechanical motion the reciprocating pistons require, hence; direct-acting. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Indirect-acting&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt; The power sources provide rotary motion to this type of reciprocating pump. The rotary motion of the power supply source must be converted to reciprocating motion at the pistons using a mechanical device called a crankshaft. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Simplex&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only one liquid cylinder and piston are built into the pump. They may be operated by a steam reciprocating engine or more commonly today from a rotary engine via a crankshaft and connecting rod. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Duplex&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two liquid cylinders and pistons are built into a common pump housing. Each cylinder may be operated by its own separate reciprocating engine. (with both engines built into the common housing) More commonly today, they are driven from a rotary engine via a crankshaft and connecting rods. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Triplex&lt;/title&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three liquid cylinders and pistons are built into a common pump housing. Normally driven by a rotary engine via a crankshaft and connecting rods. Although direct-acting and indirecting-acting pumps can be built with more than three cylinders, they are not very common. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;&lt;/list&gt;

            <Title>Engine Displacement</Title>
            <Text>Engine displacement is one of the terms used to compare one engine to another. Displacement refers to the total volume displaced by all the pistons during one stroke. The displacement is usually given in cubic inches or liters. To calculate the displacement of an engine, the volume of one cylinder must be determined &lt;me&gt;V_1 = (πr^2)h&lt;/me&gt; where r is the piston radius and h = the stroke. The volume of one cylinder is multiplied by the number of cylinders to obtain the total engine displacement &lt;me&gt;D = n V_1&lt;/me&gt;.

            <Title>Flooding of the engineroom</Title>
            <Text>Uncontrolled flooding of the engineroom is a serious situation that can lead to loss of the vessel.  The symptoms include an obvious major leak from a piping system or heat exchanger, accompanied by a rapid rise in the bilge level.

As the water level rises, the following consequences may be anticipated:

*	Salt water will enter into the feed system through the ADT and condensate pump glands and cause high salinity in the boilers.
*	Electric pumps will fail as they submerge, resulting in loss of turbogenerators, fire-main, cooling systems, bilge pumps, etc.
*	The main lube oil sump, double bottoms and reserve feed tanks may become contaminated if water enters through the sounding tubes.
*	Flammable liquids in tanks and bilges will rise with the flood water and may start fires when they come in contact with hot surfaces.
*	Uncontrolled flooding of compartments will lead to loss of vessel stability.
*	Cold sea water coming in contact with hot steam lines and the boiler may result in rupture and boiler explosion.

Major flooding incidents are usually the result of carelessness, for example, when sea valves are accidentally opened while the main condenser is opened up for repair, or when shipyard work on skin valves is incomplete when the vessel is re-floated in the drydock.  Sea valves should be locked closed whenever condensers and coolers are opened for repair and all work should be inspected to be water tight before pressurizing.  Other causes of flooding include expansion joint failure, broken cooling water lines, leaking stern gland packing, flooding through leaking non-return valves in the bilge pump suction manifold, collision, etc.</Text>

            <Title>Thermometers</Title>
            <Text>Liquid in Glass Thermometers  are the most common instruments for measuring temperature.  The basic principle involves the expansion or contraction of a temperature-sensitive substance in response to temperature changes. This type of thermometer consists of a liquid (usually mercury or colored alcohol) sealed in a glass tube. The liquid expands or contracts with temperature changes, and the temperature is read from a scale etched on the thermometer.

            <Title>Introduction</Title>
            <Text>Pressure is the measure of a perpendicular force exerted per unit area on the boundaries of a substance (or system). It is caused by the collisions of the molecules of the substance with the boundaries of the system. As molecules hit the walls, they exert forces that try to push the walls outward. The forces resulting from all of these collisions cause the pressure exerted by a system on its surroundings.

Pressure is directly proportional to force and inversely proportional to the area over which the force is applied. Increasing the force applied to a surface or decreasing the area increases the pressure. 
Mathematically, pressure is expressed as:  &lt;me&gt;Pressure = \frac{Force}{Area}&lt;/me&gt;</Text>

            <Title>Unusual noise or vibration from turbines or gears</Title>
            <Text>Unusual noise or vibration emanating from anywhere in the main propulsion machinery or turbogenerators is always cause for concern. The problem may be simple and result in very little downtime,  or may result in complete loss of the main engine.

The symptoms of this casualty are simply unusual noises or vibrations.  Note, however, that it may be difficult to pinpoint the exact source of the noise or vibration since all the parts of the main engine are connected to one another.

Any number of problems can lead to noise or vibrations.  Some are listed here:

*	Improper turbine start-up

	-	Improper turbine warm up can cause bowing of the turbine rotor, and the consequent rubbing of the blade tips on the turbine casing.  This not only causes noise, but it also wears down the  interstage packing, which reduces turbine efficiency.  Turbine warm-up procedure should always be carefully followed.
	-	Failure to properly drain the turbine casing can cause vibrations and noise as the blades rotate through the accumulated condensate. 

*	Mechanical problems

	-	Worn or damaged turbine, gear, or line shaft bearings
	-	Axial misalignment due to thrust bearing failure
	-	Torsional vibrations due to slip-stick in the stern tube or strut bearing
	-	Vibrations caused by a bent shaft, misalignment, or flexible coupling malfunction
	-	An unbalanced, damaged, or fouled propeller
	-	Broken or loose turbine blades, or broken gear teeth
	-	Mechanical imbalance of the rotor or gears
	-	Loose holddown bolts

*	Operational problems

	-	Incorrect steam temperature or pressure, wet steam
	-	Boiler carryover deposits accumulating on the turbine blades
	-	Rotor bowed due to standing idle too long during maneuvering
	-	Increased propeller loading when operating in shallow water
	-	Operation at the critical frequency of the turbine/gear system
	-	Improper lubrication -- cold oil, dirty oil, insufficient flow</Text>

            <Title>Operation of a Governor</Title>
            <Text>The following is an explanation of the operation of a constant speed, hydraulically compensated governor using the Woodward brand governor as an example. The principals involved are common in any mechanical and hydraulic governor. 
The Woodward speed governor operates the diesel engine fuel racks to ensure a constant engine speed is maintained at any load. The governor is a mechanical-hydraulic type governor and receives its supply of oil from the engine lubricating system. This means that a loss of lube oil pressure will cut off the supply of oil to the governor and cause the governor to shut down the engine. This provides the engine with a built-in shutdown device to protect the engine in the event of loss of lubricating oil pressure. 
The governor controls the fuel rack position through a combined action of the hydraulic piston and a set of mechanical flyweights, which are driven by the engine blower shaft. Figure 28 provides an illustration of a functional diagram of a mechanical-hydraulic governor. The position of the flyweights is determined by the speed of the engine. As the engine speeds up or down, the weights move in or out. The movement of the flyweights, due to a change in engine speed, moves a small piston (pilot valve) in the governor's hydraulic system. This motion adjusts flow of hydraulic fluid to a large hydraulic piston (servo-motor piston). The large hydraulic piston is linked to the fuel rack and its motion resets the fuel rack for increased/decreased fuel.

            <Text>Although the term may be unfamiliar to you, you probably know more about &lt;em&gt;internal energy&lt;/em&gt; than you realize. Because molecules are constantly in motion, they exert a pressure on the walls of the pipe, boiler, cylinder, or other object in which they are contained. Also, the temperature of any substance arises from, and is directly proportional to, the activity of the molecules. Therefore, every time you read thermometers and pressure gages you are finding out something about the amount of internal energy contained in the substance. High pressures and temperatures indicate that the molecules are moving rapidly and that the substance therefore has a lot of internal energy. 
For most purposes, we will not need to distinguish between the two stored forms of thermal energy. Therefore, instead of referring to internal potential energy and internal kinetic energy, from now on we will simply use the term &lt;q&gt;internal energy.&lt;/q&gt; By internal energy, then, we will mean the sum total of all internal energy stored in the substance or system because of the motion of the molecules and because of the forces of attraction between molecules.

            <Title>Physics Mass Equations</Title>
            <Text>The mass of an object can be determined without the use of a balance by using a formula that has mass as a variable. In physics, a common method for how to find mass is associated with Sir Isaac Newton's second law of motion. This law describes an object's inertia and states that net force (F), measured in Newtons (N) equals mass (m) multiplied by acceleration (a), i.e., F=ma. 
The equation variables can be algebraically rearranged to solve for mass so that m=F/a. Thus, if the amount of force applied to an object and its rate of acceleration is known, the mass of the object can be calculated by dividing the force by the acceleration. 
𝐹=𝑚𝑎 
𝐹/𝑎=𝑚 
Mass can also be calculated when the weight of an object is known. 
W=mg 
How to Find Mass 
There are several options available to solve for mass. Which mass equation to use will depend on the situation and the available information. Consider the following examples using the physics mass equations. 
Example 1: Using Newton's Second Law of Motion (F=ma or m=F/a) to calculate mass. 
A force of 150 N is applied to an object which then accelerates at 3 m/s/s. What is the mass of the object? 
The example problem provides information about force and acceleration which means Newton's Second Law of Motion formula can be used (F=ma). 
The formula must be rearranged algebraically to solve for mass (m). This is done by dividing both sides of the equation by acceleration (a): 
𝐹=𝑚𝑎 
𝐹/𝑎=𝑚𝑎/𝑎 
𝐹/𝑎=𝑚 
Now the force (F) and acceleration (a) variables can be replaced by the values from the example problem: 
150𝑁/3𝑚/𝑠/𝑠=𝑚 
Finally, the value for force is divided by the value for acceleration to solve for mass: 
50𝑘𝑔=𝑚 
The object has a calculated mass of 50 kg. 
When using Newton's Second Law to solve for mass, the equation shows mass to be a proportion of the force applied to an object to its acceleration. In this relationship, if the same force is applied to an object with a mass of 100 kg and to an object with a mass of 25 kg, the object with a mass of 25 kg will have a greater acceleration. This is because the object with a greater mass would require a greater applied force to achieve an acceleration equal to an object with a smaller mass. 
Example 2: Using weight and gravitational acceleration (W=mg or m=W/g) to calculate mass, 
The weight and gravitational acceleration equation is very similar to Newton's Second Law equation. Weight is a force and replaces the F variable from Newton's equation. Gravitational acceleration in the weight equation replaces the acceleration variable from Newton's Law and is a constant. On Earth, it is 9.8 m/s/s. Other planets and the moon have different values for gravitational acceleration. Thus, the more mass an object has, the greater the force of weight it will experience. 
What is mass equal to? 
Mass is equal to the following: 
Mass is equal to the density multiplied by volume. Mass is equal to energy divided by the speed of light squared. Mass is equal to weight divided by the acceleration of gravity. Mass is also equal to net force divided acceleration. 
What is the formula for mass and weight? 
The formula for weight states that weight is equal to mass multiplied by the acceleration of gravity (i.e., W=mg). 
The formula for mass can therefore be m=W/g. However, mass is also equal to the net force needed to accelerate an object, divided by its acceleration (i.e., M = F/A).

            <Text>Like work, torque is a force multiplied by a distance. However, the difference lies in how force and distance are multiplied, and what kind of distance is used in this scenario. For work, the force (&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;) and the distance (&lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;) are multiplied by a dot product. Because it is the dot product of two vectors, it is a scalar value. 

   &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt;=&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;⋅ &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;=&lt;em&gt;F d cos θ&lt;/em&gt;

Let’s clarify the difference with examples. If there is a box and I am pushing it horizontally, I am doing work on it. If I push it onto an inclined plane to load it onto the back of a truck, it’s still work because the box is not fixed on any particular axis. However, if I take that box and put it on one end of a seesaw, with myself standing at the other, both the box and I are applying torques on the seesaw. The seesaw’s fulcrum fixes it on an axis that causes rotational motion. 
Torques, however, involve rotation along a fixed axis. Therefore, instead of a dot product, we need to use a cross product. We also can’t use the distance d that we applied in the previous work equation because we are not displacing the object a certain distance. We are rotating it along a fixed axis. To calculate torque, we must introduce a new vector, &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; (radius). Physically, &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; is the distance from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is applied. 

   &lt;em&gt;τ&lt;/em&gt;=&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; ×&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;= &lt;em&gt;r F sin θ&lt;/em&gt;

Torque (τ⃗) is calculated using the cross product of the position vector (r⃗) and the force vector (F⃗): 
Magnitude of Torque: τ= r⋅ F ⋅ sin (θ) where θ is the angle between the position vector and the force vector. 
Direction of Torque: The direction of τ⃗ is given by the right-hand rule as described above. It is perpendicular to the plane formed by r⃗ and F⃗ 
Torque Formula is given by the cross product between Force and the displacement vector from the pivot point. Thus, mathematically torque can be written as: 

   &lt;em&gt;Torque = Force × Displacement Vector&lt;/em&gt;


   &lt;em&gt;OR&lt;/em&gt;

Torque (τ) = Force (F) × Distance (r) × sin (θ) 

   &lt;em&gt;Where θ is the angle between vector r and vector F.&lt;/em&gt;

τ is the torque. 
F is the force applied. 
r is the distance from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is applied. 
θ is the angle between the lever arm and the direction of the force.

            <Title>Generation</Title>
            <Text>Since this is a cycle, it has no beginning or end, but &lt;em&gt;we&lt;/em&gt; have to start somewhere, so let’s begin with the generation stage.
Steam generation occurs in the boiler. The boiler is simply a device used to boil water. Like a tea-kettle on the stove, it contains liquid water and a heat source. As the water is heated, its temperature rises and soon it begins to boil. On the stove, the water vapor or steam rises and dissipates into the kitchen, but not so in a boiler. The boiler is a closed vessel, like a pot with a lid, and any steam generated in the boiler rises to the top and is collected before being sent on to the next step of the cycle.
In the generation stage, the chemical energy stored in the ship’s fuel is released when the fuel is burned in the boiler furnace, and some of this energy is transferred to the working fluid – the water. The water gains energy, and we can detect this in two ways: the water’s temperature goes up, and the water changes &lt;em&gt;state&lt;/em&gt; from a liquid into water vapor, which we call steam. Steam leaves the boiler at high pressure and high temperature.
As we will learn in &lt;xref ref="thermodynamics"/&gt;, heat energy which raises the temperature of a substance such as water or steam is sometimes called sensible heat while the heat energy that actually boils the substance is called latent heat.
You probably remember that water boils at 212 °F at standard atmospheric pressure (14.7 psia). If you put a thermometer into a pan of water boiling on the stove, this is what it will read. Even if you turn the flame up to add more heat energy, you won’t be able to make the water temperature rise above 212 °F. This is because you are adding latent heat, which is not reflected by an increase in the water’s temperature. All of the heat energy is being used to turn the liquid water into a vapor.
The boiling or condensing temperature of a liquid is known as its saturation temperature. The saturation temperature for a particular liquid is determined by its pressure, and cannot be changed. For example, 212 °F is the saturation temperature for water at atmospheric pressure, and there is nothing anybody can do to change it.
In order to reach high steam temperatures, which is necessary for high steam cycle efficiency, the boiler must be operated at a pressure far above atmospheric pressure. A typical marine boiler operates at about 600 psi while some have operated as high as 1200 psi, although this introduces additional maintenance difficulties. Shoreside steam power plants operate at 3000 psi or even higher.
Steam temperature is raised even further by superheating the steam. Superheating steam raises its temperature above the saturation temperature for the corresponding steam pressure by continuing to add heat to the steam after it has completely vaporized. This must take place in a separate area, called the &lt;em&gt;superheater,&lt;/em&gt; away from liquid water, or the additional heat would simply boil more water rather than superheating the steam. Superheated steam is said to be &lt;em&gt;dry&lt;/em&gt;, which means that all liquid water has vaporized and it contains no moisture droplets. Drops of liquid water would damage the turbine in the expansion step described below.
Improving efficiency is a major concern of mechanical and marine engineers. High efficiency means that fuel is not wasted, and operating costs are minimized. Practical boiler designs incorporate many techniques to maximize efficiency. For example, not all of the chemical energy originally contained by the fuel ends up transferred to the steam. A large portion of this energy is lost up the smokestack, carried away by the combustion gases. Practical boilers usually contain some sort of heat exchanger in the smokestack in an effort to recover some of this energy.

            <Text>Insulators are materials which have very high resistance, and are extremely poor conductors.  Rubber, plastic, glass, ceramic, mica, and air are examples of good insulators.
Insulators are not used as part of a circuit, but rather they are used to &lt;ul&gt;
prevent accidental contact with live electrical components, reducing the risk of electric shock hazards. 
cover electrical wires and cables to prevent contact between conductors and to ensure that current flows along the desired path without unintentional leakage or interference.
physically separate and electrically isolate different parts of an electrical circuit. This prevents unintended short circuits and interference between components.
mount and support electrical components, preventing them from coming into direct contact with conductive surfaces or other components that could cause unintended connections.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <Text>The connecting rod connects the piston to the crankshaft. See Figure 2 and Figure 3 for the location of the connecting rods in an engine. The rods are made from drop-forged, heat-treated steel to provide the required strength. Each end of the rod is bored, with the smaller top bore connecting to the piston pin (wrist pin) in the piston as shown in Figure 6. The large bore end of the rod is split in half and bolted to allow the rod to be attached to the crankshaft. Some diesel engine connecting rods are drilled down the center to allow oil to travel up from the crankshaft and into the piston pin and piston for lubrication. 
A variation found in V-type engines that affects the connecting rods is to position the cylinders in the left and right banks directly opposite each other instead of staggered (most common configuration). This arrangement requires that the connecting rods of two opposing cylinders share the same main journal bearing on the crankshaft. To allow this configuration, one of the connecting rods must be split or forked around the other.</Text>

&lt;/figure&gt;
A ball valve, &lt;xref ref="ball_valve_png"/&gt;, is similar to a plug valve except that a   spherical rather than cylindrical plug is used. The ball has a hole or port bored   through it and is made tight to the two openings in the body by plastic or synthetic   rubber seat seal rings. These plastic or synthetic seat rings limit most ball valves to   fluid temperatures of 350° or less. When the ball is rotated to the closed position, the   fluid pressure pushes the ball tightly against the outlet seat ring insuring tight   closure. 
Ball valves are compact, self-sealing, non-sticking, require little effort to rotate   the valve stem and they provide smooth fluid flow. Since the port in the ball is   normally the same I.D. as the piping, the ball valve offers little resistance to flow   and low pressure drop.

  Head is defined as the vertical distance between two liquid levels. Head, for a pump, is simply the distance, measured in &lt;q&gt;feet of fresh water,&lt;/q&gt; between the pump suction connection centerline and the liquid level in the supply tank, or between the pump discharge connection centerline and the liquid level in the discharge tank. Static head in feet can be related to the pressure that the pump must generate in the fluid to create these differences in liquid levels. Static head also influences the output capacity of the pump. 
When discussing pumps, we are always referring to  static head. In other engineering courses, you will learn about other types of head. For example, in Fluid Mechanics, you will calculate the pressure necessary to overcome friction in the pipelines, called  friction head, and the pressure required to impart velocity to the fluid, known as  velocity head. 
&lt;figure xml:id="static_head_png"&gt;
 &lt;caption&gt;Static Pump Head&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;image source="images/static_head.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Head can also be thought of as the pressure necessary to support a column of water of a height equal to the head. Since head can be related to pressure, you may be wondering how atmospheric pressure affects the pump. Usually there is no effect at all. Since atmospheric pressure acts on the surface of the liquid in both the suction and discharge tanks, the effect is equal but in opposite directions on each side of the pump, and the result is that the net effect of the atmospheric pressure on the pump, is canceled out. 
Several different head measurements are used to describe the operation of a pump. The relationship between these heads is illustrated in &lt;xref ref="static_head_png"/&gt;.

            <Text>Can you define energy? Although everyone has a general idea of the meaning of energy, a good definition is hard to find. Most commonly, perhaps, energy is defined as the &lt;q&gt;ability of a system to do work.&lt;/q&gt; This is not a very complete definition. Energy can produce other effects which cannot possibly be considered &lt;q&gt;work.&lt;/q&gt; For example, heat can flow from one object to another without doing work; yet heat is a form of energy, and the process of heat transfer is a process that produces an effect. 
A better definition of energy, therefore, states that &lt;q&gt;energy is the capacity for producing an effect.&lt;/q&gt; Energy exists in many forms. For convenience, we usually classify energy according to the size and nature of the bodies or particles with which it is associated. Thus we say that &lt;em&gt;Mechanical energy&lt;/em&gt; is the energy associated with large bodies or objects, usually, things that are big enough to see. &lt;em&gt;Thermal energy&lt;/em&gt; is energy associated with molecules. &lt;em&gt;Chemical energy&lt;/em&gt; is energy that arises from the forces which bind the atoms together in a molecule, Chemical energy is demonstrated whenever combustion or any other chemical reaction takes place. &lt;em&gt;Electro-magnetic&lt;/em&gt; energy is energy that is associated with the electron and charged particles. Light, x-rays and radio waves are examples of electro-magnetic energy. &lt;em&gt;Nuclear energy&lt;/em&gt; is associated with the particles in the nucleus, and is governed by Einstein’s famous equation E = mc^2 Each of these types of energy (mechanical energy, thermal energy, etc.) must also be classified as being either stored energy, or energy in transition.  &lt;em&gt;Stored energy&lt;/em&gt; can be thought of as energy that is actually &lt;q&gt;contained in&lt;/q&gt; or &lt;q&gt;stored in&lt;/q&gt; a substance or system. There are two kinds of stored energy: potential energy, and kinetic energy. When energy is stored in a substance or system because of the relative &lt;em&gt;positions&lt;/em&gt; of two or more objects or particles, we call it potential energy. When energy is stored in a substance or system because of the relative &lt;em&gt;velocities&lt;/em&gt; of two or more objects or particles, we call it kinetic energy.

            <Text>Voltage, is a fundamental concept in electricity.  In simple terms, voltage serves as the driving &lt;q&gt;push&lt;/q&gt; or &lt;q&gt;force&lt;/q&gt; that propels electric charges through a circuit. Other terms used for voltage include electromotive force (EMF), or electric potential difference.   In electrical formulas and equations, you will see voltage symbolized with a capital E or V for steady or average values, or with an e or v for time varying values.
&lt;definition&gt;&lt;statement&gt;
The volt (unit symbol: V) is the unit of electromotive force in the International System of Units.  An electric potential difference of one volt between two points will impart one joule of energy per coulomb of charge moving between them.  Another, more practical, definition of a volt is the potential difference required to drive one amp of current through one ohm of resistance. 
&lt;/statement&gt;&lt;/definition&gt;
Voltage in an electrical system is equivalent to pressure in a fluid system, and just as a pump generates fluid pressure, voltage must be generated somehow.  There are several methods to produce a voltage, including chemical reactions (such as in batteries) and the photovoltaic effect (as in solar cells); however, the most important method is electromagnetic induction.  Electromagnetic induction is the process where a changing magnetic field induces (creates) an electric voltage in a nearby conductor.   This phenomenon is the basis for generating electricity in devices like generators and transformers and it will be described in more detail in &lt;xref ref="topic-faradays-law"/&gt;.
A voltage source (power supply) such as a battery or generator is connected to the attached circuit at two points called the terminals. The voltage between the terminals will drive current flow from the positive terminal to the negative terminal.  The term polarity in typically refers to the orientation of the terminals. In simple terms, it indicates which terminal is positive and which is negative with respect to some reference point.</Text>

            <Title>Resistance</Title>
            <Text>Resistance is a property of a material or component in an electrical circuit that opposes the flow of electric current. When a voltage is applied across a circuit component, its resistance restricts the flow of charged particles and reduces the magnitude of the current.  Resistance is measured in ohms and is denoted by the symbol R.  Large resistance, particularly electrical insulation resistance is measured in megohms, where 1 megohm = 1 million ohms.
&lt;definition&gt;&lt;statement&gt;
One ohm (unit symbol: Greek Capital Omega, \Omega) is defined as that amount of resistance that will produce one ampere of current when a one volt potential difference applied across the conductor. 
&lt;/statement&gt;&lt;/definition&gt;
The resistance of a conductor depends on three factors&lt;ul&gt;
The material properties of the conductor.  If current flows easily the material is said to be a good conductor, with low resistivity. Gold, silver, copper and aluminum are all good conductors. Copper and aluminum are commonly used for wires and cables, but gold and silver only used for small electrical contacts due to the cost.
The conductor length. The resistance of a conductor is directly proportional to the length of the current path. 
The conductor’s cross-sectional area. As with fluid in a pipe, the narrower the path, the greater the resistance to flow. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The resistance of a conductor is given by &lt;men&gt;R = \frac{\rho L}{A}&lt;/men&gt; where: &lt;ul marker=""&gt;
R\  is the resistance of the conductor, in ohms.
L\  is the length of the conductor, in meters.
A\  is the cross-sectional area of the conductor, in square meters.
\rho\  is the resistivity of the conductor, in ohm-meters.

            <Text>As the boiler is operated, the burner tips tend to get clogged with deposits of unburned fuel oil. Once each day the burners must be removed from the boiler and cleaned. The burner is removed and allowed to cool, then the tip is removed and soaked in a burner cleaning solution to loosen up the deposits. After soaking, the remaining deposits are removed by scraping with a brass or copper implement. Soft metal tools are used to avoid damaging the tip and holes. Finally the burner is reassembled, inspected and placed back into service. Be aware that the burner cleaning solution, called &lt;em&gt;carbon remover&lt;/em&gt;, will cause chemical burns of your skin and eyes. Always use caution, and wear proper protective gear such as rubber gloves and a face shield, when working with carbon remover.

Most screw pumps consist of two to four intermeshing screws rotating in a closely fitted chamber. Liquid, trapped in the channels between the intermeshing screws, is pushed to the pump discharge as the thread of one screw rotates onto the channel of another screw. One screw, generally called the  , is driven by an outside power source. The other screws, generally called  , have their shafts turned by timing gears or by direct contact between the intermeshing screw threads.

            <Title>Expansion</Title>
            <Text>The thermal energy added to the working fluid in the generation stage is converted to mechanical energy, or work, in the expansion stage. This work is produced in the form of a rotating turbine shaft which drives the propeller and moves the ship through the water. The more energy we can remove at this stage, the higher the efficiency of the steam cycle. Unfortunately, it is not possible to remove all the energy from the steam in the turbine. Some energy remains in the steam and is carried to the next stage of the cycle.
A turbine is the device used to accomplish the energy transformation in the expansion stage. Like a pinwheel or a fan, a turbine has a freely rotating shaft with many carefully designed turbine blades attached. However, unlike a fan, the turbine rotor is completely enclosed in a casing which also contains nozzles and stationary blades designed to direct the steam towards the rotating blades.
&lt;figure xml:id="fig_turbine_blades"&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;  Turbine Blades  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;image width="50%" source="images/turbine_blades.png"&gt;
&lt;remix&gt; &lt;source&gt; Intro to Steam book &lt;/source&gt;&lt;/remix&gt;
&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
High-pressure, high-temperature steam passes through the nozzle, which has a very small opening, and it emerges with a high velocity. The thermal energy of the steam is converted into mechanical kinetic energy in the nozzle. This high velocity steam jet hits the blades and imparts a turning torque to the rotor shaft and converts its kinetic energy to rotational kinetic energy of the shaft. Most turbines have several rows of blades, forming multiple stages to extract the maximum energy from the steam. As the steam gives up its thermal energy, its temperature and pressure both drop. The steam leaves the turbine at a low temperature and low pressure.
High steam pressure at the inlet to the turbine is important for energy conversion, but it is equally important to have a low pressure at the turbine outlet. Steam, or any fluid for that matter, will only flow from high pressure to lower pressure. Without a pressure drop across the blades of the turbine, there would be no steam flow, and no energy conversion. To maximize the energy conversion, we must also maximize the pressure drop across the turbine.

If the casualty involves the main propulsion system, slowing or stopping the vessel may be prudent, but this should only be done in consultation with the bridge.
If the casualty involves thegenerators, you can reduce the load on the generators by stripping non-vital equipment at the main switchboard.  Some candidates include the air conditioning compressors, lighting load centers, galley equipment, and ventilation fans.  You can also start the auxiliary diesel generator and put it on the line.

Carbon resistors are fundamental and affordable resistors made by mixing carbon granules with a binder, suitable for general-purpose applications. 
Film resistors, including metal film and carbon film, have a thin resistive film deposited on a ceramic or glass substrate, and offer higher stability and precision than carbon resistors. 
Wire wound resistors have a resistive wire wound around a core, often made of ceramic or fiberglass. They are used for high-power applications and where precision and stability are crucial. 
Variable resistors, also known as potentiometers, allow manual adjustment of resistance and are used for tuning purposes. 
Metal Oxide Varistor  MOVs are used as voltage-dependent resistors to protect circuits from voltage spikes and surges. 
Surface-mount resistors are compact and designed for surface-mount technology, facilitating modern electronics assembly processes.

            <Title>Atmospheric Pressure</Title>
            <Text>Air, which is all around us, has weight, and it presses against everything it touches. This pressure is called the absolute pressure of the atmosphere or the atmospheric pressure. This pressure is equal to the weight of a column of air extending from the earth to space divided by the area of the column.  In space, where there is no atmosphere the atmospheric pressure is zero, and this condition is known as a perfect vacuum.
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Atmospheric Pressure&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="75%" source="images/atmospheric-pressure.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
At sea level the average atmospheric pressure is sufficient to support a column of mercury (Hg) 760.0 millimeters or 29.92 inches, equivalent to approximately 14.7 psia or 101.325 kPa. At higher elevations, the atmospheric pressure is less than at sea level. The bar is a unit of pressure equal to 100 kPa, which is just slightly less than 1 atmosphere.
The device used to measure the pressure of the atmosphere is called a barometer, so the absolute pressure of the atmosphere is also known as the barometric pressure. When you hear a weather report, this is the value reported. 
The barometric pressure changes with weather conditions, but for most purposes aboard ship, this fact can be ignored, and we can assume that the atmospheric pressure is 14.7 pounds per square inch absolute (psia) or 760 mm Hg. at all times.  Notice, however, that the figure of 14.7 psia  represents the average atmospheric pressure at sea level, and does not represent the actual pressure of the atmosphere at a particular place or time.

            <Title>Introduction</Title>
            <Text>A  P&amp;amp;ID, which stands for "Piping and Instrumentation Diagram," is a detailed schematic diagram that represents a process system using graphical symbols to show the piping, equipment, instrumentation, and control devices involved.  P&amp;amp;IDs are commonly used in various industries, including chemical processing, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, power generation, and many others. They serve several important purposes:

1. **Process Visualization:**  P&amp;amp;IDs provide a visual representation of a complex process system, making it easier for engineers, operators, and other stakeholders to understand the system's components and how they interact.

2. **Design and Engineering:**  P&amp;amp;IDs are essential during the design and engineering phases of a project. Engineers use them to plan and design process systems, including the layout of pipes, equipment, and instrumentation.

3. **Communication:**  P&amp;amp;IDs act as a universal language in engineering. They help facilitate communication among different teams, such as engineers, designers, operators, and maintenance personnel, by providing a clear and standardized way to discuss and document the process.

4. **Safety:**  P&amp;amp;IDs play a critical role in ensuring safety. They show safety devices, relief valves, and emergency shutdown systems, helping to identify potential hazards and safety measures.

5. **Maintenance and Troubleshooting:** During operation,  P&amp;amp;IDs are valuable for maintenance and troubleshooting. They enable personnel to identify components, valves, instruments, and their locations quickly.

Typically,  P&amp;amp;IDs include various elements:

- **Pipes and Lines:** Piping and conduit lines are represented by lines with specific line types (e.g., solid lines for process lines, dashed lines for utility lines).

- **Equipment:** Equipment such as pumps, compressors, tanks, heat exchangers, and reactors are depicted using standardized symbols.

- **Instruments:** Instruments such as sensors, controllers, and recorders are represented by symbols that indicate their function and type.

- **Valves and Control Valves:** Different types of valves and control valves are shown with symbols that indicate their operation and control functions.

- **Control Loops:** These are used to represent the control systems and feedback loops within the process.

- **Safety Devices:** Safety features like relief valves, pressure safety valves, and emergency shutdown systems are depicted.

- **Annotations and Labels:**  P&amp;amp;IDs include labels, tags, and annotations that provide additional information, such as equipment names, pipe sizes, flow rates, and other relevant data.

Creating and reading  P&amp;amp;IDs is a specialized skill, and professionals known as process engineers or piping and instrumentation designers are typically responsible for their creation and interpretation.  P&amp;amp;IDs are crucial documents for ensuring the safe and efficient operation of complex industrial processes and systems.</Text>

            <Title>Action [actionlowlo]</Title>
            <Text>If the main lube oil pump fails, the stand-by pump is supposed to automatically start and pick up the load.  Upon hearing a lube oil pressure alarm, you should immediately verify that the stand-by pump has started and that there is flow through the bull's eye.  If this is the case, the casualty has been averted and all that remains is to discover and repair the cause of the original failure.

If the stand-by pump does not start you must **immediately stop and  lock the shaft**.  The governor will close the ahead throttles, but the vessel's way will keep the propellor and shaft turning.  To stop the shaft, open the astern guardian valve and the astern throttle and admit enough steam to bring the shaft to a complete halt.   To lock the shaft, engage the jacking gear.   If the ship happens to be going astern at the time of the casualty, it will be more difficult to stop the shaft with the ahead throttle because  it will be held closed by the low lube oil trip.  To open it you will need to manually override the trip by using the emergency lever on the throttle assembly to jack open the governor valve.  See [](#turbinecontrol) for more information.

A sudden stop of the engine will impact the plant -- the drum level will first swell as the astern turbine brings the shaft to a hault, then shrink when throttles are closed; boiler pressure will build up and safeties may lift, and it will be necessary to cut out burners.  Turbine extractions will need to be changed over to live steam. If the turbine will be out of service for longer than about five minutes, the main condenser vacuum should be broken, and make-up feed, vacuum drag, and auxiliary exhaust dump changed over to an auxiliary condenser.

Restoration of service should include identifying and correcting the root cause, and an inspection of the bearings for damage.  Shift and clean the lube oil strainers and look for metal debris in the baskets.  Remove bearing covers and inspect, starting with the most remote and the hottest bearings to look for signs of damage.  </Text>

That pressure is called atmospheric pressure, or air pressure. It is the force exerted on a surface by the air above it as gravity pulls it to Earth. Atmospheric pressure is the pressure exerted by the Earth's atmosphere at a given location. For example, standard atmospheric pressure at sea level is 760mmHg, 14.7 psia or 101.325 kPa. In Denver, Colorado, atmospheric pressure 12.4 psi or about 84.0 kPa, and in Death Valley, California it is 14.9 psi or 102.6 kPa.

            <Title>Firing Order</Title>
            <Text>Firing order refers to the order in which each of the cylinders in a multi-cylinder engine fires (power stroke). For example, a four cylinder engine's firing order could be 1-4-3-2. This means that the number 1 cylinder fires, then the number 4 cylinder fires, then the number 3 cylinder fires, and so on. Engines are designed so that the power strokes are as uniform as possible, that is, as the crankshaft rotates a certain number of degrees, one of the cylinders will go through a power stroke. This reduces vibration and allows the power generated by the engine to be applied to the load in a smoother fashion than if they were all to fire at once or in odd multiples.</Text>

            Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus, which have a wearable clean-air supply pack. These units have better mobility than the air-supplied respirator, but the clean air time is limited to the capacity of the tank. 
            Combination Respirators, which are similar to the air-supplied respirators, but also have a small, self-contained air supply which can be used for escape if the primary supply fails.

            <Text>Because diesel engines requires close tolerances to achieve the required compression ratio, the air entering the engine must be clean, free of debris, and as cool as possible.  The air intake system is designed to perform these tasks. Air intake systems vary greatly from vendor to vendor but are usually one of two types, wet or dry. 
In a wet filter intake system, as shown in &lt;xref ref="air-intake-sys-pic"/&gt;, the air is sucked or bubbled through a housing that holds a bath of oil such that the dirt in the air is removed by the oil in the filter. The air then flows through a screen-type material to ensure any entrained oil is removed from the air.  
In a dry filter intake system, paper, cloth, or a metal screen material is used to catch and trap dirt before it enters the engine, similar to the filters used in automobile engines. 
&lt;figure xml:id="air-intake-sys-pic"&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Air Intake System&lt;/caption&gt;
  &lt;image source="images/diesel-image19.png" width="60%"/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
In addition to cleaning the air, the intake system is usually designed to take fresh air from as far away from the engine as practical, usually outside of the engine's building or enclosure. This provides the engine with a supply of air that has not been heated by the engine's waste heat. The reason for ensuring that an engine's air supply is as cool as possible is that cool air is more dense than hot air. This means that, per unit volume, cool air has more oxygen than hot air. Thus, cool air provides more oxygen per cylinder charge than less dense, hot air. More oxygen means a more efficient fuel burn and more power. After being filtered, the air is routed by the intake system into the engine's intake manifold or air box. 
The manifold or air box is the component that directs the fresh air to each of the engine's intake valves or ports. If the engine is turbocharged or supercharged, the fresh air will be compressed and possibly cooled before entering the intake manifold or air box. The intake system also serves to reduce the air flow noise. 
Turbocharging and supercharging are two methods used to increase the power output of a diesel engine by forcing more air into the combustion chamber.

            <Title>By Suction Characteristics</Title>
            <Text>Some types of pumps are designed with such close clearances between moving and stationary parts in the pump chamber that they will actually pump air, gases, or vapors as well as liquids. These pumps can be started with no liquid in the pump chamber and will pump the air out of the suction pipe, lowering the pressure, eventually causing the liquid to lift up and enter the pump. These types of pumps are considered to be  self-priming. 
Other types of pumps, because of larger internal clearances, will not pump air or gases and will not lower the pressure in the suction pipe enough to lift the liquid to the pump chamber. These types of pumps must have the suction pipe and the pump chamber completely flooded with the liquid to be pumped or they will not lift the liquid. Filling the suction pipe and pump chamber with liquid to place these pumps in operation is called  priming the pump.

In the US standard system, pressure is commonly measured using pounds per square inch (psi) in which the force units are pounds (lbs.) and the area units are square inches &lt;em&gt;(&lt;/em&gt;
   {in.}^{2}). 
The psi unit represents the amount of force (in pounds) exerted on a one-square-inch area. For instance, a pressure of 30 psi means that a force of 30 pounds is distributed over each square inch of the surface. 
Pressure = \frac{Force}{Area} =\frac{Pounds}{InchesSquared} =\frac{lbs.}{{in.}^{2}} = psi 
Pressure =\frac{Force}{Area} =\frac{Force = ma}{Area} F = ma (mass x acceleration) = \frac{mx{32.2fts}^{2}}{Area}</Text>

            <Title>Piston and Piston Rings</Title>
            <Text>The piston transforms the energy of the expanding gasses into mechanical energy. The piston rides in the cylinder liner or sleeve as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. Pistons are commonly made of aluminum or cast iron alloys. To prevent the combustion gasses from bypassing the piston and to keep friction to a minimum, each piston has several metal rings around it, as illustrated by Figure 6. These rings function as the seal between the piston and the cylinder wall and also act to reduce friction by minimizing the contact area between the piston and the cylinder wall. The rings are usually made of cast iron and coated with chrome or molybdenum. Most diesel engine pistons have several rings, usually 2 to 5, with each ring performing a distinct function. The top ring(s) acts primarily as the pressure seal. The intermediate ring(s) acts as a wiper ring to remove and control the amount of oil film on the cylinder walls. The bottom ring(s) is an oiler ring and ensures that a supply of lubricating oil is evenly deposited on the cylinder walls.

   &lt;term&gt;Rulers and Yardsticks&lt;/term&gt; are straight, flat measuring tools commonly used for shorter lengths. A ruler measure 1 ft. or 12 inches whereas a yardstick measure 3 ft. or 1 yd.
&lt;p/&gt;

A &lt;term&gt;Tape Measure&lt;/term&gt; is a flexible tape marked with inches and feet for measuring longer distances. It is often used in construction and carpentry. 
&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;image width="50%" source="images/tapemeasure.png"/&gt;
Calipers or callipers are used to measure he dimensions of an object, generally by placing two movable points of the instrument across the object or span to be measured..
&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;image width="50%" source="images/calipers.png"/&gt;
A &lt;term&gt;micrometer&lt;/term&gt;, sometimes known as a &lt;term&gt;micrometer screw gauge&lt;/term&gt;, is a device incorporating a calibrated screw widely used for accurate measurement of components. Outside, inside, and depth micrometers are all used. The outside micrometer has a unit conversion chart between fractional and decimal inch measurements etched onto the frame
&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;image width="50%" source="images/micrometer.png"/&gt;
A &lt;term&gt;surveyor's tape&lt;/term&gt; is a long, flexible tape marked in meters used in land surveying.
A &lt;term&gt;sextant&lt;/term&gt; is a navigation instrument used to measure the angle between celestial objects and the horizon. It helps determine a ship's position at sea. 
&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;image width="50%" source="images/sextant.png"/&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;Microwave instruments&lt;/term&gt; use microwaves to take survey measurements. They have a range up to 100 km and are comprised of two identical units, a master unit, and a remote unit.
   &lt;term&gt;Infrared wave instruments &lt;/term&gt;use amplitude modulated infrared waves and prism reflectors. They have a range up to 3 km and accuracy of +/- 10mm.
   &lt;term&gt;Light wave instruments&lt;/term&gt; rely on the propagation of modulated light waves. Their accuracy varies from 0.5mm to 5mm/km, and they have a daytime range of 3km and night range of 2.5km.
   &lt;term&gt;Laser measuring tools&lt;/term&gt; send a beam to the target, which reflects off the surface and is sent back to the device. Lasers are focused beams of light that stay at a particular frequency. And because they travel from one place to another at a fairly constant rate, they can be used to measure distance with a great deal of accuracy. A laser measuring device also has a longer range than many other measuring tools, which gives it an advantage over other devices that become less precise the farther out you measure. Lasers are less likely to disperse than white light, so they can travel at a greater distance without losing their intensity. They keep most of their intensity once they reflect off a target, which is important if you want to get accurate distance measurements.
&lt;image width="50%" source="images/laser.png"/&gt;
   &lt;term&gt;Sonar&lt;/term&gt; is an object-finding system that uses sound waves to determine the distance, speed of and direction to objects within its range. ..
&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;image width="50%" source="images/sonar.png"/&gt;
These instruments allow engineers, sailors, and others to accurately measure lengths and distances according to their respective systems of measurement. It's important to note that many professionals now use digital instruments, such as laser distance measurers, which can provide precise measurements in multiple units.

            <Title>International System of Units (SI)/Metric (kPa)</Title>
            <Text>In the metric system, pressure is typically measured using kilopascals (kPa), which represent newtons per square meter (N/m²). One pascal is equal to one newton of force distributed over a one-square-meter area. However, this is a relatively small pressure, so in practical applications, kilopascals (kPa) or megapascals (MPa) are commonly used. 
One newton is the force needed to accelerate one kilogram of mass at the rate of one meter per second squared. So, we can say one newton is one kgm/s². 
Force Units are measured in pascals or kilopascals (newtons). 
Area Units are measured in centimeters or meters squared. 
In the SI system, pressure is described in pascals (Pa). Since Pressure = Force/Area, the equation for measuring pressure in pascals is: 
Pressure (pascals) = \frac{Force}{Area} =\frac{Newtons}{MetersSquared} =\frac{N}{m^{2}} = \frac{kg}{mxs^{2}}

Pressure = \frac{Force}{Area}
   \frac{Newtons}{Meterssquared}= \frac{F = ma}{MetersSquared} = \frac{kgxM/s^{2}}{MetersSquared}=\frac{Forceduetogravity = 9.8m/s^{2}}{Area}</Text>

            <Title>Gauge Vacuum (inHg)</Title>
            <Text>Bourdon Tube Vacuum Gauges are used to measure pressures less than atmospheric pressure with the Vacuum Gauge range from 0 to 30 inches Hg. Atmospheric pressure at Sea Level is 14.7 psia or 101.325 kPa, which corresponds to 0 gauge. When in use and the vacuum increasing, the needle will move towards larger numbers with 29.92 inHg being the greatest achievable vacuum at Sea Level, as per Torricelli’s experiment. 
Vacuum pressure gauges and Pressure gauges, both start at zero-gauge pressure with zero-gauge pressure corresponding to atmospheric pressure. When the vacuum pressure gauge decreases below atmospheric, the vacuum gauge needle will begin to move off zero and move towards 29.92 in Hg gauge, stopping at the reduced pressure being measured. The value of 29.92 inches of mercury (inHg) gauge corresponds to the maximum possible vacuum that can be achieved relative to the atmospheric pressure. 
0 Gauge Pressure = Atmospheric Pressure, 14.7 psia in US Customary Units or 101.325 kPa in SI Units. 
Almost all Vacuum Gauge readings will be somewhere between 0 and 29.92 inHg 
In working with Inches Mercury Gauge readings, it is essential to convert those readings into psia (absolute) values. The converted readings can be used when consulting Steam Tables for additional properties related those readings. 
&lt;figure&gt;

      &lt;/row&gt;
   &lt;/tabular&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
Let’s say the Vacuum Gauge indicates 10 inHg. 
This indicates the pressure is &lt;em&gt;less than&lt;/em&gt; atmospheric pressure and mercury is the measuring element. This reading, in Inches Mercury (inHg), must be converted to PSIA to utilize Steam Tables that are established on PSIA. 
Knowing One Inch of Mercury exerts .491 psi Hg 
10 inHg gauge can be multiplied by .491 psi Hg equaling 4.91 psi 
Knowing 14.7 psia is Atmospheric Pressure and that inHg vacuum gauges indicate less than atmospheric: 
Vacuum Gauge Reading Equivalent psia = 14.7 psia – (10 inHg x .491 psi Hg) 
= 14.7 psia – (4.91 psi) 
= 9.79 psia</Text>

            <Title>Flanged Connections</Title>
            <Text>Flanges are circular discs with machined faces, attached to the ends of a section of pipe.  Flanges provide a method of connecting pipes, valves, pumps and other equipment to form a piping system.

&lt;figure xml:id="fig_flanges"&gt;

&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/sidebyside&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Flanged joints are made by bolting together two adjacent flanges with a gasket between them to provide a seal.  Flanged connections are used for higher-pressure applications and situations where dismantling might be necessary. 
The materials and design of the flanges are governed by the requirements of service, and in most cases, a flange is of the same material as the pipe.  Flanges in steel piping systems are usually screwed or welded to the pipe or tubing, while flanges in nonferrous systems are usually brazed.
A blind flange (also called a 'closure plate flange') has no center hole, so nothing can flow through the flange. Blind flanges may be used to temporarily seal a piping system while testing, modifying or repairing the line, to create an access point in a piping system,  or to create a long-term seal to terminate a piping system that is not used.
&lt;figure xml:id="fig_blind_flange" &gt;
&lt;caption&gt;   Blind Flange  &lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;image width="25%" source="images/blind_flange.png"&gt;

&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
A spectacle blind flange is shaped like a pair of glasses or spectacles  &lt;mdash/&gt; hence the name. One half is open to allow flow through during normal operation and the other side is solid to block flow and secure the system for maintenance.  The two halves are separated by a spacer with a hole for one flange bolt. They are generally installed in the piping system permanently. 
&lt;figure xml:id="fig_spectical_blind_flange" &gt;
&lt;caption&gt;   Spectacle Blind Flange  &lt;/caption&gt;

&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/sidebyside&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
To change the position, the system must first be secured, depressurized and locked out.  After removing the flange bolts, the spectacle blind can be rotated to the other side, the gaskets replaced, and the bolts retightened.

An orifice flange is used in conjunction with a differential pressure sensor to measure the rate of flow in the pipe. 
An orifice is a hole through which fluid may pass. When fluid flows through an orifice it creates a pressure drop, which is measured by the pressure sensor.  The flow rate through the orifice is proportional to the square root of the pressure drop and can be calculated knowing the orifice diameter. 
&lt;figure xml:id="fig_orifice_flange" &gt;

&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/sidebyside&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
The orifice flange assembly consists of a pair of flanges containing pressure taps, an orifice plate,  jacking screws and the normal gaskets, nuts and bolts.  The orifice plate has a precision hole (the orifice) drilled through its center, and a tab stamped with the hole diameter.  Taps are threaded holes drilled through the flanges where the differential pressure sensor is connected.  The jacking screws are used to spread the flanges when replacing the orifice plate.

            <Text>A torque wrench is a precision tool commonly used to apply a specific amount of torque to fasteners such as nuts and bolts. A torque wrench has a calibrated scale or a digital display that allows the user to set and control the applied torque accurately.

Torque wrenches are used to apply precise amounts of torque to fasteners, ensuring they are neither too loose nor too tight. Over-tightening can strip threads or break fasteners, while under-tightening can lead to parts coming loose or failing to function properly. Manufacturers specify torque requirements for their products, and adhering to these specifications is often necessary to prevent damage and maintain warranties.

Control Software and Function Blocks
Control Software containing function blocks is the brain or the heart of HDEC2000 unit. The software controls all of hardware which performs its own task of self diagnosis, measurement, regulation, limitation function, protective function, monitoring and communication. Control software is an executable codes set and stored in nonvolatile Flash memory.
Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd 12 Electro Electric Systems
 
The function blocks especially perform major regulation functions and limitation functions, and a part of control software. The most of function blocks are designed based on excitation system models of IEEE421.5 standard.
Excitation Power Flow
Excitation input power is normally supplied from the excitation transformer connected with generator output terminals or supplied from a permanent magnet generator (PMG). Some case, excitation input power may be supplied from external utility. Excitation output power of HDEC2000 unit is supplied to excitation winding of main machine or exciter machine after rectification and smoothing process through power module (switching IGBT) controlled by regulation output signal (PWM duty) of software function block of HDEC2000 unit.
Control Power
No external control power is normally required for HDEC2000 unit since the control power is internally supplied from excitation input power. For few special application, either ac or dc power source may be supplied externally. Control power is used as driving power of each component in the HDEC2000 unit. See Section 3 (Functional Description) and Appendix C (Specification) for more detailed information.
Sensing Input and Auxiliary Input
The voltage and current sensing signals for HDEC2000 unit are measured from sensing transformer installed on generator or generator external cubicle. Both of single phase or three phase voltage sensing configuration is supported by HDEC2000 unit. In case of current sensing system, single phase sensing is available and cross current loop sensing is also available. Excitation voltage and excitation current signals are sensed by measuring device installed internally.
For remote control application by analogue signal, +/-10Vdc, 4 ...20mA or other standard signal is available and the HDEC200 unit also provides the control capability by the analog signal.
Digital Input and Output
Most of control Tasks such as excitation on/off, Auto/Manual and Setpoint Adjust are achieved via digital input signal. The HDEC2000 unit provides seven digital inputs for predefined functions and three digital inputs for programmable functions. Digital inputs can be controlled with dry contactor or PLC open collector signal. The HDEC2000 unit provides three programmable output relays and one watchdog relay also.
Communications
Three communication ports are provided for initial configuration in the factory (or commissioning in site), for data exchange between HDEC2000 units for redundant system and for remote access. The communication ports consist of RS232 (COM0), CAN (COM1) and RS485 (COM2) ports.

  Note!
Two (or one) cross sections for connection cables are listed in each Table (Table 2-1 to Table 2-5). Two numbers in the cross section column mean the useable cross section range. First number indicates the minimum cross section and bottom number indicates the maximum cross section. However, Accepted cross section of connecting cable is depending on the shape, straight length and the diameter of used connection ferrule.
 We strongly recommend that only one cable may be connected with one terminal, except COM2 (RS485) shield wire terminal. Even though, not recommended, If user wants to connect two cables with same terminal, the inserting depth of ferrules, connection looseness and the accepted cross sectional area of terminal should be considered.

  Function Description and Remark
              No external control power is required in most application for HDEC2000 unit. If the HDEC2000 unit requires the external control power, applicable cables and terminals are followed referring to Table2-5. For more information about the kind(s) of external sources and range, see Appendix C (Specification).
  IMPORTANT
In case of shunt power application, if the residual voltage is too low (e.g. lower than 6Vac when measured at excitation input terminals), the external control power must be supplied for voltage buildup. The pre-excitation power may be supplied alternative.
  Excitation power Input and Output
Three kinds of Excitation input power (Shunt, PMG and external Utility) are available. In case of three phase source, all three terminals E1, E2, E3 (Labeled A, B, C) are used out of turn. In case of single phase or dc source is supplied, any two terminals out of three may be used.
Excitation power output of the HDEC2000 unit is connected with excitation winding, F1, F2 (Labeled F+, F-) terminals are used for Excitation power output. HDEC2000 unit can supply maximum 15Adc through power module (IGBT) controlled by PWM duty.

HDEC2000 unit provides seven digital inputs for pre-defined functions and three digital inputs for programmable functions. Digital inputs can be controlled by external dry contact or PLC open collector output. In all cases, the digital inputs should be connected with potential free contact (or switch). Each function of digital inputs is described below.
Excitation ON (START/STOP) command
 Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd 29 Electro Electric Systems

This input determines the condition of excitation on (or off). If this input circuit is closed, HEC2000 unit regulates the excitation power through the power module (IGBT). If this input is opened, the excitation output power is cut off. Continuous contact should be used for this input command.
Normally, This input may be closed while the prime mover speed is higher than specified value (typically 50 ...90% of nominal), If the prime mover speed is lower than specified value, or if the generator heavy fault signal is activated, this input should be opened.
However, in case of shunt power application (excitation power is supplied from the transformer connected with generator output terminal) with no external control power and with no excitation input contactor, the excitation on input may be always closed. Alternatively, in this case, we recommend that the excitation input contactor may be installed for the protective purpose, and excitation on input channel may be connected with the auxiliary contact of excitation input contactor instead of external excitation on command. Figure 3-2 shows the typical schematic diagram of excitation on control for the shunt power application with no control power.
In above case (shunt power application with no control power, and input contactor is installed), we strongly recommend that the maximum speed for excitation on is less than approximately 70% of nominal to prevent initial voltage overshoot due to hardware voltage buildup function. See the voltage buildup function for more information.

For more relative or detailed information, see ready mode function and loss of power function in this section. Or, please contact Electro Electric Systems - Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., LTD.
Especially, in cases that the loss of power is enabled and the loss of power option is configured with [Reset soft Start Time], even though it is not recommended, this input can be always closed for simple application.
Manual select command (non Automatic mode)
This input determines the basic regulation mode of HDEC2000 unit. If this input circuit is closed, HDEC2000 unit operates with FCR mode. Otherwise, the unit operates with AVR mode, VAR mode or PF mode depending on other digital inputs and configuration parameters. Continuous contact should be accepted for this input command.
FCR mode is prior to all operating modes and functions. In the FCR mode, all limitation functions and some protective functions are disabled.
Raiser, Lower command
This input(s) adjusts the setpoint (reference) of active operating mode. The raise command increases the setpoint, and the Lower command decreases the setpoint of active operating mode. These actions are enabled while the corresponding input circuit is closed. If the setpoint of active operating mode reaches to its [max Setpoint] or [min Setpoint], these actions are disabled. Momentary contact should be accepted for these input commands.
The total ramping time which is required to traverse from minimum to maximum setpoint is determined by [Setpoint Traversing Rate] parameter of active operating mode.
MCB (Machine circuit breaker) status
This digital input channel detects on/off status of the machine (generator) circuit breaker which connects the generator to the electrical bus or other generators. If this input channel is used, normal-opened auxiliary contact of generator circuit breaker should be connected.
If this input circuit is closed, HDEC2000 selects either reactive droop compensation or cross current compensation depending on [CCC Enabled] parameter when the operating mode is not FCR Mode.
If this input circuit is opened, HDEC2000 unit disables both the Droop (droop compensation) and CCC (cross current compensation) modes.
The MCB status is not essential part of excitation system. Sometimes it can be omitted. If the excitation system is designed for the generator to be always operated with AVR mode without droop compensation and without CCC, MCB status input circuit can be always opened.
Otherwise, if the excitation system is designed for the generator to be always operated with AVR mode with droop compensation, this input circuit can be always closed.

HDEC 2000 User Manual Rev. D
 Alternative, if no auxiliary contact of generator circuit breaker is available or user wants to simple hardwire configuration, the [Virtual MCB] parameter having three options (None, Close, Open) can be used instead of auxiliary contact of physical circuit breaker. The functions of three options listed below are described. But, to enable the CCC function, the auxiliary contact of physical circuit breaker is essentially required.
 [None]: MCB status of HDEC 2000 software is determined by the digital input connected with actual generator circuit breaker
 [Close]: MCB status of HDEC 2000 software is always settled with closed condition.  [Open]: MCB status of HDEC 2000 software is always settled with opened condition.
GCB (Grid circuit breaker) status
This digital input channel normally detects the on/off status of grid circuit breaker (not machine circuit breaker) which connects the generator to the infinite power grid (not island grid) in comparison with generator output rating. If this input channel is used, normal-opened auxiliary contact of grid circuit breaker (or combined logic status of some circuit breakers) must be connected.
The logical combination of GCB status, MCB status and related configuration parameters select either VAR mode or PF mode. Table 3-2 shows that the operating-mode selection logic depending on the digital inputs and configuration parameters.
If MCB and GCB status are closed, and [VAR/PF Mode] is configured with [VAR] or [PF], HDEC2000 unit operates either VAR mode or PF mode while the FCR mode is not selected. The VAR mode or PF mode is selected by the setting of [VAR/PF Mode] parameter. Otherwise, HDEC2000 unit operates with AVR mode.

Due to the safety reason, we recommend that this digital input channel may be connected with the logically combined status of some user’s circuit breakers which determine VAR or PF mode depending on the power grid configuration.
Programmable #1, #2, #3 input (Command or Status)
HDEC2000 unit provides three programmable input channels for flexible configuration. Any function pre-defined by HDEC2000 software can be assigned for the programmable digital input channel.
If the input circuit is closed, the assigned function corresponding to its digital input channel is enabled (activated).The useable functions are listed and described below.
 [None]:
No function is assigned and no action is executed.
 [Preposition]:
If a corresponding input circuit is closed, HDEC2000 unit changes the setpoint of all operating modes (AVR, FCR, VAR and PF) to the pre-settled [Preposition Setpoint] of each operating mode. This function is useful for initialization of setpoint adjusted by user or for the application which required the fixed setpoint permanently. Momentary or continuous contact may be accepted for this function depending on application.
In some cases, this function is used to prevent excessive over voltage when circuit breaker is opened from the condition that the generator operates with FCR mode, and heavy load.
 [SecondaryUnit]:
This function determines that HDEC2000 unit operates with primary (master) or secondary (backup) unit for redundant application configured with two HDEC2000 units. If a corresponding input circuit is closed, HDEC2000 unit operates with the secondary unit. The secondary unit always tracks the primary unit via CAN communication. This function is not supported now, and the revision for this function is planned later. Continuous contact may be accepted for this function.
 [LocalRequest]:
HDEC2000 unit can be commanded from three directions via three devices of digital input commands of left panel (local command), COM0 port (RS232) and COM2 port (RS485, read only now). This function determines that the local command (physical digital input command) is priority.
If a corresponding input circuit is closed while the HDEC2000 unit is controlled remotely, then the commands from remote device are disregarded. Momentary contact may be accepted for this function. For more information about remote access, see separated MODBUS communication manual.
 [SecondarySoftStart]:
This function is used for the special application (e.g. the different two kind’s loads are powered from one generator at different time). If corresponding input circuit is closed, The HDEC2000 unit controls the voltage setpoint by using the second soft start parameter set. Even though the status of digital input is changed during
HDEC 2000 User Manual Rev. D
  Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd 33 Electro Electric Systems

soft starting processing, the changed event is not applied, but it may be applied with next excitation on event. For more information, see soft start function.
Alarm Reset command
When the input circuit is closed, this input clears the latching status of all fault events of the output relay assigned for fault event, internal software fault flag, front panel fault messages and fault LED. Momentary contact may be accepted for this command.
Analog Input and Output
HDEC2000 unit measures nine analogue signals. The seven signals are external inputs and two other signals are internally measured. The processing procedure of analogue signals is described below.
First, all analogue signals are converted to suitable low level by means of resistive divider, shunt resistor, current transformer or current sensor. Next, the analogue signals are transmitted to ADC (analogue to digital converter) through operational amplifiers, analogue filter circuits and MUX (multiplex). Finally, DSP (digital signal processor) performs quantization, digital filtering and signal conversion for the analogue signals. HDEC2000 unit performs control and other functions by using of these signals.
The analogue signals measured by HDEC2000 unit are listed below:
 Three phase-to-phase generator voltages (A-B phase, B-C phase, C-A phase, C-A phase).
 GeneratorBphasecurrent
 Crosscurrentloopinput
 AuxiliaryvoltageinputandAuxiliarycurrentinput
 Dclinkvoltage(excitationvoltage)
 Excitationcurrent
Generator voltage sensing
This signal is normally measured from sensing voltage transformer installed on generator inside or generator circuit breaker cubicle.
HDEC2000 unit provides three voltage sensing range (110Vac, 220Vac and 460Vac). HDEC2000 unit automatically selects voltage measuring range by using the turn ratio of sensing voltage transformer and the generator nominal voltage.
The unit supports both single phase and three phase sensing system. In case of three phase sensing system, the average of three phase-phase voltage is obtained for the purpose of regulating. In case of single phase sensing system, the A-C phase voltage is obtained. We recommend that user designs three phase sensing system for the more stable (smaller feedback ripple) voltage feedback and the fast regulation response.
The combination of true rms technique and optimum digital filtering technique achieves very stable and fast control of the generator voltage even though the sensing voltage has very high harmonic component. This voltage sensing signal is used for most of function as well.

Generator B-phase current sensing
This signal is measured from current transformer having 1A or 5A secondary current. And the current transformer must be installed on generator B-phase. This signal is used for reactive droop compensation, VAR/PF control and other functions.
When very big induction motor is started by using only one generator, if the starting current is higher than approximately 1.5 times of rated generator current and the starting current should be limited lower than proper level, the current transformer and the current input range of HDEC2000 unit must be considered to prevent the saturation (or over range) problem of both component.
Cross current loop input
The current signal called cross current loop input for reactive differential compensation (for reactive load sharing between generators) is measured from the loop circuit consist of some current transformers having 1A secondary current. And the all current transformers must be installed on generator B-phase.
To obtain equal reactive load sharing by cross current compensation, the turn ratio of cross current CTs of all paralleled generators should be same based on percent output rating of each generator.
The 2Ω burden resistor is installed internally in the HDEC2000 unit for compensating the unequal reactive power sharing caused by different resistance of interconnection cables. By this reason, no external burden resistor is required.
Also, the internal auxiliary relay controlled automatically by MCB status is installed in HDEC2000 unit. By this reason, additional auxiliary contact of generator circuit breaker is not required for the cross current compensation.
Auxiliary voltage input, Auxiliary current input
Normally, HDEC2000 unit controls the generator voltage (or other controllable parameter depending on operating mode) by using the setpoint determined by raiser (or lower) input channel. Sometimes, the auxiliary analogue signal called Auxiliary Input (auxiliary voltage or auxiliary current) adjusts the generator voltage together with raise and lower commands depending on application.
Two kinds of analog signal can be connected with HDEC2000 unit at the same time. Even though HDEC2000 unit measures both signals simultaneously, HDEC2000 unit controls the generator voltage by using the converting signal called analog reference, and the analog reference is converted from either auxiliary voltage or auxiliary current depending on [Aux Input Type] parameter.
After the analog reference is calculated from auxiliary input, the analog reference is multiplied with [AUX Gain] of each operating mode. And then, the multiplied value (analog reference * Gain) is summed up with the setpoint of each operating mode depending on [Aux Input Summing Type] parameter. Summed-up values (analog reference * Gain) are defined as a percentage of rated quantities for all operating modes.

We recommend that the analog signal may be used for auxiliary control only (ex: very narrow band adjustment for precision control or auxiliary control for synchronization). And it is also recommended that the analog signal is only used for adjusting the setpoint of one main operating mode (e.g. AVR mode or VAR/PF mode) to prevent the discordance between the summed setpoint of inactive operating mode and the actual value of inactive operating mode (e.g. the summed setpoint of FCR mode cannot track the actual excitation current during AVR mode even though the bump-less mode transfer function is enabled).
  Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd 36 Electro Electric Systems

If auxiliary signal is supplied from the device such as the similar kind of PLC analogue output card (having multiple channels), we recommend that isolation signal converter may be used to prevent any influence caused by other device connected with same PLC card.
Dc link voltage (Excitation voltage)
The DC Link Voltage is internally measured from rectified voltage of excitation input power. This signal is used for protective function and monitoring purpose. The monitored excitation voltage of the HDCM software is not value directly measured from excitation output terminal but calculated from dc link voltage by using PWM duty and voltage drop of power module (IGBT).
Excitation current
This signal is internally measured from output current of power module (IGBT) by using of current sensor installed in HDEC2000 unit. This signal is used for the excitation current control, over excitation limitation, protective functions and monitoring purpose.
Excitation power
Three kinds of Excitation input power source (Shunt power, PMG power and External utility) are available. Three phase ac. source, single phase ac. source, or dc power source is usable and the permissible maximum voltage is 260Vac or 360Vdc. The input power is rectified and smoothed by capacitor, and then supplied to excitation winding through the power module (IGBT).
The current ratings of excitation input power source and all other components carrying excitation current are not calculated from the power rating of HDEC2000 unit, but should be determined from design data of the generator.
If the excitation input voltage is much higher than the excitation requirement, the dynamic response is improved but control accuracy or stability may be reduced.
On the other hand if the margin of excitation input voltage is a little bit higher than excitation requirement, the control accuracy or stability may be improved, but the dynamic response may be very poor. The balance between dynamic response and control accuracy is the first consideration in the designation of excitation system (input power). See Appendix C (Specification) for more information.
Control power
HDEC2000 unit does not require the external control power for the most of application. In case of external control power is supplied depending on application, some consideration may be made. For more information, see Voltage Buildup function of this section, section 2 (Installation and Hardware) and Appendix C (Specification).
If excitation system is designed with permanent external control power, external control power must be supplied to the unit before any generator
operation or excitation input power contactor (or switch ...) is closed. Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd 37 Electro Electric Systems

CAUTION
     
Digital (Relay) Output
HDEC2000 unit provides three programmable output relays and one watchdog relay. The output relays are controlled by DSP (digital signal processor) and the power rating is 250Vac, 10A.
Even though the current rating of relays is 10A, we strongly recommend that the output relay be used with the control purpose only for the robustness of overall excitation system.
If the output relay is connected with reactive load (ex: relay coil) in dc circuit, the load should have freewheeling diode across the load terminals, or the freewheeling diode should be installed externally to protect the circuit against switching arc.
Programmable Output relay #1 to #3
The output relay#1 to #3 can be assigned for any functions (or events) listed below. When the assigned function or event is activated, the output relay is also energized and latched (if assigned for fault event). The logic of each relay contact can be configured with normally opened (NO) or normally closed (NC).
More than one function can be assigned simultaneously for one relay. In this case, the logical combination (combined with OR logic) determines whether the output relay is energized or not. Assignable fault events (or functions) are listed below:

Also, if the abnormal software execution is detected, the excitation power output is shut downed by HDEC2000 unit to prevent the damages of the generator, system and the HDEC2000 unit.
In case of critical application, we recommend that the excitation power input be disconnected for overall system protection if watchdog relay contact is closed
Peripheral Device Communication and User interface
The communication ports consist of RS232 (COM0), CAN (COM1) and RS485 (COM2) ports. For more information about communication, see section 4 (Configuration) and separated MODBUS communication manual.
For Information about User interface, see section 5 (User Interface).
Memory usage and configuration
Three types of memories (Flash memory, RAM and EEPROM) are internally used for HDEC2000 unit operation. EEPROM stores configuration parameters, and user can access (readable and writable) to this information via HDCM software. Executable control software code (firmware) is stored in the nonvolatile Flash memory integrated in the DSP. RAM is used for temporary data storage, and it is also integrated in the DSP.
OPERATIONAL FUNCTION
This section describes control modes, limitation functions and protective functions of HDEC2000 unit. The helpful technical information is also described for understanding the internal architecture of the unit.
Regulation Mode and More
Controller (Function block) and Control gain
HDEC2000 unit has four regulation (operating) modes called FCR, AVR, VAR and PF mode. One regulation mode is selected depending on the combination of digital input(s) and configuration parameters.
Each regulation functions are performed by its controller (sometimes called software function block) containing adjustable control gains, and each controller controls the target parameter such as voltage, excitation current, reactive power or power factor by using control gains. Thus, the control gain is one of the major parameters which determine the dynamic (or static) response or steady state stability of generator and excitation system.
Four major control gains are used for each controller. Some controller has all four control gains or more and other controller has only two control gains. The simplified description of each control gains are listed below

 Integral Gain KI: improve steady state error and recovery speed
 Derivative Gain KD: Improve the steady state stability and initial response
For more detailed information about control gains tuning and controller structure, see section 4 (Configuration) and Appendix B (Mathematical Models).
FCR mode
FCR regulation mode controls the excitation current by setpoint. HDEC2000 unit measures the excitation current and compares it with commanded setpoint. And the unit controls the excitation current so that the excitation current be equal to [FCR Setpoint]. FCR controller is PI (proportional, integral) controller which has KG, KP, and KI. In the FCR mode, over excitation limiter, stator current limiter, under-excitation limiter and the under frequency limiter are not enabled.
FCR mode is normally used for commissioning or selected for the application which requires manual control like test bench system.
AVR mode
AVR regulation mode controls the generator voltage by setpoint. HDEC2000 unit measures the generator voltage and compares it with commanded setpoint. And the unit controls the excitation current so that the generator voltage be equal to [AVR Setpoint]. AVR controller is PID (proportional, integral, derivative) controller which has KG, KP, KI and KD.
In case of the medium or small size generator which is connected with related big power grid (not island grid) or in case of synchronous motor application, the AVR mode cannot be selected. In which case, the VAR mode or the PF mode is preferred.
VAR mode
VAR regulation mode controls the reactive power by setpoint. The HDEC2000 unit measures the reactive power and compares it with commanded setpoint. And the unit controls the excitation current so that the reactive power be equal to [VAR Setpoint]. VAR controller is PI (proportional, integral) controller which has KG, KI.
VAR control mode is only prepared in case of small or medium generator which is connected with related big power grid (not island grid) or in case of synchronous motor application.
PF mode
PF regulation mode controls the power factor by setpoint. The HDEC2000 unit measures the power factor and compares it with commanded setpoint. And the unit controls the excitation current so that the power factor be equal to [PF Setpoint]. PF controller is PI (proportional, integral) controller which has KG, KI
PF control mode is only prepared in case of small or medium generator which is connected with related big power grid (not island grid) or in case of synchronous motor application.

Droop compensation (reactive current compensation)
Droop compensation provides the reactive load sharing if generator operates in parallel with other generator(s) or power grid. HDEC2000 unit adjusts (compensates) the measured generator sensing voltage depending on the calculated reactive current. Compensated voltage feedback (internally applicable sensing voltage for AVR function block) is calculated with simplified below formula.
UC = UG + (iG IMAGE * 0.01 * Reactive Droop Compensation) Where: UC is the compensated sensing voltage applied to AVR function block (controller)
UG is the measured (sensed) generator voltage
iG IMAGE is the calculated reactive current from measured value:
- positive sign: over excitation, negative sign: under excitation Reactive Droop Compensation: configuration parameter in percent
According to above formula, the compensated feedback (sensing) voltage is increased if reactive power increases. HDEC2000 unit reduces generator voltage as a result of feedback voltage increasing. This means that higher reactive power causes more generator voltage drop and lower reactive power causes the less generator voltage drop. So, the reactive load sharing is possible by droop compensation, because the reactive power is proportional to the generator voltage.
CCC (Cross current compensation or Reactive differential compensation)
Cross current compensation provides the reactive load sharing when the generator operates in parallel with other generator or power grid (not huge grid but island grid consist of some or few generators).
CCC function detects (senses) the residual unbalanced current in the CCC loop. And HDEC2000 unit internally adjusts (compensates) the measured generator sensing voltage depending on CCC loop current by mean of same manner described above (in the droop compensation part)
Compared with droop compensation, this function has a few features such as no (or fewer) voltage drop and automatic correction of unequal reactive power caused by unequal droop or unequal droop characteristic. But in case that the system requires high grade reliability and independence between each generator’s excitation system and it is important issue, the cross current compensation is not recommended because of complexity of system configuration.
If CCC function is enabled, the disconnected CCC input cable must be isolated with each other when HDEC2000 unit is repaired (or replaced). Or, install the optional CCC disable switch. If not so, the unequal reactive load sharing may be caused. ... See Figure 2-5
Other manufacturer supports the reactive load sharing through communication link.
However, in this case, if one generator (or regulator) is in fault, disconnection of communication cable can cause the breakdown of reactive load sharing. So HDEC2000 unit does not support reactive load sharing via communication link. In case of hardwire cross current compensation, the compensation mode is automatically transferred to droop compensation mode even though cross current loop is broken because the faulted

regulator is removed (CCC loop cable is disconnected). But in this case, [Reactive Droop] parameter is applied instead of [CCC Droop] parameter.
Voltage buildup
Most functions of HDEC2000 unit are digitally controlled. But few functions are realized by hardware device (by analogue circuit only). Voltage buildup function is one of these functions realized by hardware device.
In case of shunt power application, the residual generator voltage is very low (typically 4 ...15% depending on the exciter machine’s design). If no control power is supplied to the internal control circuits of voltage regulator, the power module (switching semiconductor, IGBT) of voltage regulator cannot be turned on. This leads that the generator voltage never increases to its desired value in normal case.
HDEC2000 unit provides the voltage buildup function without external control power for shunt power application.
Even though the excitation input power is very low (typically single phase 6Vac), the hardware buildup circuit of HDEC2000 unit can turn on the power module (IGBT), this leads that the generator voltage increases from very low residual voltage to its nominal voltage. This function is automatically disabled by DSP (digital signal processor) when the DSP booting process is completed. The hardware voltage buildup function has very useful advantages in case of shunt application without external control power. For enabling the hardware voltage buildup function, toggle switch 2 (Labeled SW2) installed on the right panel of the unit must be closed (turned ON). For other cases (with external control power or non shunt excitation power), the toggle switch SW2 must be opened.
HDEC 2000 User Manual Rev. D
   IMPORTANT
Hardware voltage buildup function is not always guaranteed. In case of shunt application, if the residual voltage is too low (e.g. approximately lower than 6Vac when measured at excitation input terminals), the external control power should be supplied for voltage buildup, or the pre-excitation circuit must be applied during startup.
  Ready mode function
In case of shunt power application with no external control power, if the excitation on command circuit is opened while prime mover operated with nominal speed, large generator voltage fluctuation (approximately 15 to 50% depending on the turn-ratio of excitation transformer) may be occurred by hardware voltage buildup function (due to the continuous repetition process of voltage coast-down, DSP power-down, hardware voltage buildup and DSP power-up).
To prevent this voltage fluctuation and to maintain power up condition of HDEC2000 unit, HDEC2000 unit controls the generator voltage with very low level (approximately 15 ...20%) of nominal value depending on the turn ration of excitation transformer. This function is called with ready mode function.
If user wants minimum (residual) induced voltage at nominal speed operation with excitation off status, the excitation power input contactor (switch) should be installed and it should be turned off. It is the best solution in case of shunt power application (with no control power) for safety.

Soft start function
The soft start function leads the generator voltage buildup to the nominal setpoint voltage with minimal overshoot for the desired (configured) time from excitation on event. When excitation on command is detected, after the time delay corresponding [Soft Start Delay] time, The HDEC2000 unit linearly adjusts [AVR Setpoint] from [Soft Start Level] to [AVR Mode Setpoint] through [Soft Start Time].
Typical setpoint change by soft start function is shown in Figure3-3. In case that the generator speed does not reach to nominal value within [Soft Start Time], the generator setpoint is limited by under frequency limiting function. The typical setpoint change is shown in Figure in Figure 3-4. Soft start function is enabled in FCR mode also. In this case, HDEC2000 unit adjusts [FCR Setpoint].

Some cases, non-standard configuration is required for special application (if one generator is designed to service for two loads having different property. However, only one load is connected at one time).
 Case1:Thegeneratoroperateswiththeconventionalload.Themaximumloadislessthanthe generator nominal rating and the instantaneous over load (current) is not required.
 Case 2: Only one generator operates with one induction motor. The nominal load is less than generator nominal rating, but the starting capacity of induction motor is almost 4 ... 5 times of generator rating.
In this case, only one fixed soft start function (configuration) is enough for any one load, but not sufficient to satisfy for both applications.
HDEC2000 unit provides the second soft start parameter set called [Soft Start Level 2] and [Soft Start Time 2] for second case load. These two parameters are used instead of [Soft Start Level] and [Soft Start Time] when the programmable digital input is assigned with [Secondary Soft Start] and corresponding digital input circuit is closed.
The sample configuration is listed below if the second soft start function is assigned for the load corresponding to case-2 described above.

Bump-less mode transfer (Internal tracking) function
Bump-less mode transfer (sometimes called internal tracking) function minimizes the impact or fluctuation of system parameter (e.g. voltage) when switching from one operating mode to another operating mode.
When the operating mode transferred from AVR mode to FCR mode:
The FCR setpoint is continually updated by actual value (excitation current) during AVR mode and the control output (PWM duty) of FCR mode is determined from the value of AVR control output when the operating mode is transferred from AVR mode to FCR mode.
However, after the operating mode is changed, the setpoint of active operating (FCR) mode is gradually changed to the memorized (and smoothed) excitation current before [Internal Tracking Delay Time] from mode transfer event through [Internal Tracking Traversing Rate].
If too shorter [Internal Tracking Delay Time] is configured, and the operating condition is unstable when operating mode is transferred, the excitation current shall be not backed to desired steady level.
If too longer [Internal Tracking Delay Time] is configured, the excitation current is returned to the much older level. In second case, the new control parameter is not related with recent value.
When the operating mode transferred from FCR mode to AVR mode:
Oppositely, the setpoint of AVR mode is continually updated by actual value (generator voltage) during FCR mode and the control output of AVR mode is determined from the value of FCR control output when the operating mode is changed. And the return procedure of AVR mode setpoint is same as above explanation.

Limitation Functions
Different types of limitation functions of HDEC 2000 unit are provided for generator protection from abnormal operation condition. This section described the limitation functions.
Generator capability curve

The generator capability curve graphically illustrates the safe operation region without any damage caused from abnormal operation conditions in the P-Q (active and reactive power) plane. HDEC2000 unit provides all limitation functions for synchronous machine. A typical synchronous machine capability curve is shown in the Figure 3-5.
Under frequency limiter (V/F or UFL)
Under frequency limiting function provides
for preventing the overheating caused by
excessive magnetic flux (over excitation
current) in the low frequency range, and
provides for reducing the mechanical impact when large resistive load is suddenly applied. Under frequency limiting function is disabled in the FCR mode and also disabled if generator frequency is below than 10Hz.
HDCE2000 unit provides standard mode under frequency liming [Std UFL] and maximum flux mode under frequency limiting [Max Flux UFL] function. [Std UFL] is widely applicable for general application and provides two purpose of above. [Max Flux UFL] is very useful in case that wide generator voltage adjustable range is required (e.g. test bench application).

The [Std UFL] automatically reduces the voltage setpoint proportional to the dropped frequency when the generator frequency drops down lower than the [Under Frequency Corner Frequency]. The [Under Frequency Corner Frequency] is configured with typically 95% of nominal. The setpoint reduction rate is determined by [Under Frequency Slope (or V/Hz ratio)]. Generator voltage is more rapidly decreased if this parameter is increased. Typical standard mode under frequency limiting function is shown in Figure 3-6.

Over Excitation Limiter (OEL)
Over-excitation limiting (OEL) function operates in order to prevent the overheating when the excitation current exceeds the safe level. Or, OEL operates in order to prevent the over voltage with no load operating condition. OEL function can be always enabled in any operating mode except the FCR operating mode. If the excitation current exceeds the limiting level by any reason, the excitation current is limited below than the configured level.

Three kinds of current level, [Hi level], [Mid level] and [Low level] are used for limiting the excitation current. The excitation current level corresponding to the [Hi level] and [Mid level] is only allowable during the time configured as [Hi Time] and [Mid time] parameters. The [Low level] excitation current can be accepted continuously.
Generally, [Hi level] is used for limiting the short circuit supporting excitation current or initial high excitation current on special application (e.g. the system consisted of one generator and one induction motor only). [Mid level] is used for limiting the current when the instantaneous over load may be allowed. [Low level] is used for continuous thermal protection of excitation winding.

Default-OEL is used for protecting the HDEC2000 unit but not for generator protection when the OEL function is disabled. Default-OEL is controlled by three levels of current and two levels of limiting time similar with On-Line OEL. The internally predefined values are [Hi Level = 30A], [Hi time = 10s], [Mid Level = 20A], [Mid time = 5s] and [Low
Time Level = 15A]. Figure 3-9 Off-Line Over Excitation Limiting
Under Excitation Limiter (UEL)
Under-excitation limiting (UEL) function is used for preventing the loss of synchronization and excessive end-core heating when the generator connected with power grid and operated with under excitation region (reactive power is absorbed from grid).
HDEC200 unit measures the generator reactive power. If measured reactive power is less than the configured or calculated reactive power, the excitation current is increased by HDEC200 unit in order to be out of the unstable operating status. UEL function can be always enabled on any operating mode except the FCR mode. Two kinds of UEL are defined and the one is selected by [UEL Curve Type] parameter.
 CircularUEL
When the circle type UEL is selected, HDEC2000 unit automatically calculates the limiting level based on the [UEL Circular Reactive Power] parameter and the present measured active power. The calculated value is used as UEL reference power. [UEL Circular Reactive Power] parameter is defined based on the safe maximum (permissible) reactive power absorbed from network when no active power (power factor = 0) is present. Figure 3-10 shows typical circle type UEL curve.
 SegmentUEL
When the segment UEL is selected, HDEC2000 unit interpolates the limiting level based on the five points of active and reactive power level configured by user. The interpolated level is used as UEL reference power. The five coordinate values are configured as the [UEL Segment Real power 1 ... 5] and [UEL Segment

Generally, stator current limiting (SCL) function provides for preventing the overheating of stator winding caused from the higher current than safe level. Sometimes, this function can be used for limiting the starting current of special application (e.g. the system consisted with one generator and one induction machine only).
Figure 3-12 Typical Chart Record of SCL function
If the reactive power is less than the minimum configured level calculated from [SCL Accept PF] parameter or the generator is operated with under excitation condition, the SCL controller disregards the excessive current even though the stator current exceeds the limitation level. In case of permanent single operation (not paralleled), if the generator is operated with passive load such as lighting load and the setting level of [SCL Accept PF] parameter is higher than 0.97, the SCL controller disregards the under excitation condition ( or the less reactive power condition).
Two kinds of current levels, [Hi level] and [Low level] are used for the control of SCL. [Hi level] current is only allowable during the time configured as [Hi time] parameter, and [Low level] current can be accepted

continuously. Normally, [High Level] is used for limiting the initial inrush current of induction motor and momentary over-load, [Low Level] is used for continuous thermal protection.
Figure 3-12 is the typical chart record of SCL function:
The operating mode is transferred to AVR mode from FCR mode with generator voltage lower than [AVR setpoint], at the moment of mode transferred, because of lower generator voltage, the excitation current (PWM duty) goes to full range. But the excitation current is reduced immediately by SCL function. So, the stator current can be limited up to the configured limiting level.
Protective Functions
HDEC2000 unit provides ten protective functions listed below.  Generator over voltage
 Generator under voltage
 Generator over current
 Exciter over current
 Loss of filed (under excitation)
 Loss of sensing
 Loss of power
 Diode Fault Monitor for open and short rotating diode status (DFM)  Excitation output short circuit protection (hardware support)
 Mode mismatch
The protective functions of HDEC 2000 unit are designed to provide a high degree of reliability and accuracy, but few protective functions are not successful for critical primary protective function (e.g. generator over current) due to measuring range (or saturation problem) of measuring hardware. The reason is described below.
Internal measuring devices (ex: current sensor) are designed for optimum operation of generator voltage (or excitation current, reactive power ...) regulation because the core function of HDEC2000 unit is regulation. By this reason, we recommend that few protective functions corresponding to this kind are used for secondary protection in conjunction with a primary protective system.
Normally, a fault event is activated when the generator operating condition exceeds the setting level of each protective function and the operating condition is not returned to normal operating condition within the delay (configured or calculated) time. Each fault event can be indicated on the front panel display and remotely through Com0 or Com2 communication ports.
When any fault event is activated, internal software fault flag, front panel fault message and output relay (if fault event is assigned for that relay) are latched until the fault event is inactivated and reset command is activated. Additionally, all fault events can be assigned for any output relays (#1 relay to #3 relay).
Detailed information is described below for each protective function.

 Generator Over-voltage (GEN. OV)
When generator voltage rises above the predefined setting level and is maintained for duration of predefined over voltage delay time, the generator over voltage fault is activated.
Generator Under-voltage (GEN. UV)
When generator voltage falls below the predefined setting level and is maintained for duration of predefined under voltage delay time, the generator under voltage fault is activated. The generator under voltage fault function is disabled during [Soft Start time].
Generator Over-Current (GEN. OC)
HDEC2000 unit provides three types of generator over current (GEN. OC) protective function which called [Constant Time], [Standard Inverse Time] and [Preload Inverse Time]. The last two types of over current protective functions are very similar together, but [Constant Time] over current protective function is some different.
 ConstantTimeGEN.OC
This type of GEN. OC operates as fully same manner of GEN. OV protective function. When generator current rises above the predefined setting level [Gen. Constant OC Level] and is maintained for duration of predefined delay time [Gen. Over Current Delay], the generator over current fault is activated.
Do not use HDEC 2000 unit for primary over current protective device of overall system.
Due to the measuring range of the hardware of HDEC2000 unit and generator sensing current transformer, it can be only used for thermal protective purpose with low fault current range (ex: up to 170% of nominal).
 StandardInverseTimeGEN.OCandPreloadInverseTimeGEN.OC
These two types of GEN. OC functions are designed based on generator thermal model as per IEC255-8 standard. When generator current rises above the predefined safe operation level and is maintained for duration of calculated delay time which has inverse characteristic (function) for square of generator current, the generator over current fault is activated.
The tripping time is not pre-determined value but the calculated value from present (varied) generator current, predefined over-current delay and predefined preload current based on equivalent temperature rise. This tripping time is always varied depending on the generator current variation. This means that the relative higher generator current leads shorter tripping time when compared with relative lower generator current.
Three configuration parameters [Gen. Inverse OC Level], [Gen. Inverse OC Preload] and [Gen. Over Current Delay] determine the tripping time with measured generator current. Each configuration parameter is described below.
 Gen.InverseOCLevel:meansthesafeoperationcurrentwithoutthermaldamageinpercentbaseof generator rated current, but not means the dangerous tripping current level.

Figure 3-13 Over-Current Tripping Time VS Fault Current with preload 90%
Generator over current tripping time Ttrip can be calculated by using below formula. Ttrip=Tc*Ln{(IG2 -IP2)/(IG2 –1)}inseconds
Where: TC is the calculated time constant from [Gen. Over Current Delay] parameter = 7.2 * [Gen. Over Current Delay] in seconds
IG is the measured generator current in per-unit based on [Gen. Inverse OC Level]
IP is the configured preload current [GEN. Inverse Preload] in per-unit based on [Gen. Inverse OC Level]
The unique difference between [Standard Inverse Time GEN. OC] and [Preload Inverse Time GEN. OC] is the processing method of minimum generator current considering the difference time between heating time constant and cooling time constant.
In case of [Preload Inverse Time GEN. OC], even though the generator current is below the preload current, Software of HDEC2000 unit perceives that the generator current is still preload current (minimum generator current). However, the [Standard Inverse Time GEN. OC] always perceives the actual generator current.

Exciter over current (EXC. OC)
HDEC2000 unit provides three types of exciter over current (EXC. OC) protective functions which called [Constant Time], [Standard Inverse Time] and [Preload Inverse Time]. All three types of exciter over current functions are operates by the entirely same manner as GEN. OC protective function.
However, preload (corresponding to [Gen. Inverse OC Preload] of Gen. OC function) parameter is fixed with 70% level and the exciter over current fault event is activated when excitation current rises above predefined safe level instead of generator current. Others are the same as GEN. OC. Figure 3-13, Figure 3-14 and calculation formula for tripping time are also used for EXC. OC configuration.
Loss of field current (under excitation)
If reactive power falls (this means that the sign of reactive is minus, absorbed reactive power rises) below the predefined setting level and is maintained for duration of predefined delay time, the generator loss of field fault is activated.
Loss of sensing
The loss of sensing detection is very critical algorithm. Also it is some complex to realize. So, only one or two operating information never simply determine the loss of sensing fault. Below operating conditions are used for determining the loss of sensing fault.
(a) Excitation current is higher than 105 % of predefined no load excitation current.

 Notes
 IntheFCRmodeorduringsoftstarttime,Lossofsensingfaultisnotenabled
If loss of sensing fault is occurred, four optional protective actions called [None], [Transfer to FCR], [Fixed PWM] and [Shutdown] are available. The protective option is configured by [Loss of Sensing Option] parameter and each protective action is described below:
 None:noprotectiveoptionisassigned.
 TransfertoFCR:whenalossofsensingfaultisdetected,theoperatingmodeisautomatically
transferred to FCR mode.
 FixedPWM:whenalossofsensingfaultisdetected,theoperatingmodeisautomaticallytransferredto
FCR mode. And the excitation current setpoint is adjusted to 80% of no load excitation current. This protective action serves with no load operating condition only. If loss of sensing option is specified with [Fixed PWM] and [MCB status] is closed, then HDEC2000 unit serves [Transfer to FCR] protective action.
 Shutdown:normally,whenalossofsensingfaultisdetected,thecontroloutput(PWMdutyofIGBT)is immediately downed to zero and the excitation on command is disregarded (this means that the HDEC2000 unit is stopped). However, in case of shunt application with no control power, the control output is downed to approximately 30% of no load excitation current to prevent the repeated fluctuation of generator voltage due to the hardware voltage buildup function.
  Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd 54 Electro Electric Systems

To clear this fault, close the alarm reset digital input channel after the sensing circuit failure is corrected while internal control power is activated (in case of shunt application without external control power, close the alarm reset digital input while the generator voltage is approximately 30% ...50% of rated after the prime mover is started).
Loss of power
When generator operating status meets all of below conditions and the condition is maintained for duration of pre-settled [Loss of Power Delay Time], loss of power fault is activated. During [Soft start time], loss of power fault is not enabled. loss of power fault is not latched.
(a) [Control Power Source] = [External]
(b) [Excitation Source] = [Shunt] or [PMG]
(c) Generatorfrequencyislowerthan10Hz
(d) Dc link voltage is lower than [Loss of Power Level]
(e) Generator voltage and generator current are lower than 4% of nominal
(f) Excitation current is lower than 15 % of predefined no load excitation current
When loss of power fault is occurred, two optional protective actions called [None] and [Reset Soft Start Time] are available, and described below.
 None:Noprotectiveactionisexecuted.
 ResetSoftStartTime:thisoptionisveryuseful,ifnoexternalexcitationoncommandcontact(switch)is
prepared by user, or user do not want control the excitation on command by reason of simple system configuration.
If generator is started up from long time standstill condition, and the excitation on command is always closed, the soft start timer is may be passed its whole setting value (this phenomenon is same as that the [Soft Start Time] setting is zero). In this case, very high voltage overshoot may be obtained due to the big difference (error) between nominal voltage setpoint and very low feedback voltage (generator residual voltage). As a result of voltage overshoot, the system may be shut-downed.
However, if [Reset Soft Start Time] option is specified, HDEC2000 software automatically resets the soft start timer at the moment of releasing the loss of power fault. This means that no very high voltage overshoot is obtained even though excitation on command is always closed. This option is disabled when [Excitation Source] = [Utility]
Diode fault monitor (DFM)
HDEC2000 unit provides Diode Fault Monitor (DFM) functions. The DFM function detects opened or shorted status of diode(s) of the rotating rectifier by following means.
During normal steady operating condition, the ripple frequency of exciter field current is calculated by using below formula in case of six-pulse rotating rectifier (three phase full bridge rectifier).
FR = 6 * FG * (exciter machine poles / main machine poles) in [Hz] Where: FR is the ripple frequency of exciter field current in [Hz].
Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd 55 Electro Electric Systems
HDEC 2000 User Manual Rev. D
  
One or more shorted diode(s) produce very high ac (ripple) component current in the exciter field circuit and the frequency of ac component is 1/6 of the ripple frequency of nominal operating condition. Also, one or more opened diode(s) produces high ac (ripple) component current in the exciter field circuit, and the frequency of ac component is 1/3 of the ripple frequency of nominal operating condition.
HDEC2000 unit separates the ripple frequency component corresponding to open and short diode condition from overall excitation current by mean of digital filter techniques.
When the processed (calculated) ripple current exceeds the pre-settled fault level and the ripple current is not decreased below the fault level within the predefined delay time, the open (or short) diode fault event is activated.
The DFM function is disabled if the excitation current is less than 1A or 80% of no load excitation current. And the DFM function is also disabled if the generator frequency is not presented between 45 ...70Hz.
Output short circuit
HDEC2000 unit provides the protective function of output short circuit by mean of hardware device. Due to the relative slower processing interval of software code than physical phenomenon, software protection of excitation output short circuit is very difficult (sometimes, it is impossible). The internal measuring device detects short circuit current very fast and cuts off the excitation output power.
This function provides for preventing damage from incorrect wiring or inappropriate behavior during factory setup and commissioning. But not provides for protective function while normal operating. Be careful, short circuit of excitation output may cause unit damage since this function is not guaranteed always.

Mode mismatch
HDEC 2000 User Manual Rev. D
 FG is the frequency of main synchronous machine in [Hz].
    CAUTION
Short circuit protective function is tested with HDEC2000 regulator successfully. Be careful, Short circuit excitation output may cause unit damage since this function is not always guaranteed.
  This function compares the digital input command (FCR mode or none-FCR mode) and actual operating mode when HDEC2000 unit is controlled remotely. If a local input command (operating mode via digital input circuit) is different with actual operation mode, then mode mismatch fault event is activated. However, this fault is not latched
For example:
When The HDEC2000 unit controlled via communication port with AVR mode, but the FCR select input circuit (digital input channel) is closed, if control mode is transferred to local mode from remote mode by [Local Request] command (or remote command), HDEC2000’s operating mode is transferred to FCR mode from AVR mode. At that moment, the system may be shut downed if the difference is very high between [FCR Setpoint] and the actual-excitation-current.
Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd 56 Electro Electric Systems
 
So, user should match that the input command (digital input status) is same as actual operating mode before operating mode is transferred to local mode from remote control status.

Gain (Control Gain) Tab
This section contains the descriptions about most important configuration parameter (control gains) for optimum generator performance, and contains the directions for tuning.
General Description and Directions
Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd 68 Electro Electric Systems
HDEC 2000 User Manual Rev. D
  
Each control mode and limitation functions have its own software control (function) block, and each function block regulates the control parameter (e.g. generator voltage in case of AVR mode) corresponding to its regulation mode.
The function block(s) of HDEC2000 software operates like as below description:
First, the error (difference) between feedback signal (e.g. sensed generator voltage in case of AVR mode) and setpoint (or limitation reference) of each operating mode is calculated. Next, the error, the integral of error and the derivation of error is multiplied with each operating mode’s control gains by PID algorithm. Finally, the sum of three multiplied results (control output) determines the PWM duty of power module.
This means that the error and the control gains determine (control) the excitation current. This also means that the control gains of each function blocks determine the transient response or (and) steady state stability.
Generally, three control gains called proportional gain. Integral gain and derivative gain are used for the purpose of controlling the generator voltage (or excitation current) for brushless synchronous machine. But in case of static exciter or some function blocks having shorter delayed feedback consist of only two components (proportional gain, Integral gain) of gains.

But, too high gain leads steady state Instability.
High gain leads large compensation proportional to the error.

High gain leads very good damping response and improved initial response.
But, too high gain leads steady state Instability.

Table 4-1 illustrates the typical range of control gains of each function block from our experience, be sure, the values shown in Table 4-1 are only typical value. Optimum control gain is depending on the excitation system design, machine time constant, reactance and application. Some cases, even though the machine is same, but the optimum control gain may be different when optimum (ex: transient response or stability) criterion or the kinds of load are different. For more information about the structure of control block and control gains, see Appendix B (Mathematical Models).
Typical simulation results (voltage recovery characteristics when very big load is sudden applied) by simulation software developed by Hyundai Heavy Industrial Co., LTD with variable control gains in AVR operating mode are shown in Figure 4-3 to 4-6.
From these figures, the effects of each control gains and the generic tuning guides for PID gains can be realized.
To obtain optimum PID gains, please perform step change response by below instruction:
Change voltage setpoint (5 ...10% for no load, 2 ...5% for load condition) suddenly by using [Lower] or [Raise] setpoint button of Monitor Tab screen and monitor the generator voltage response by using proper instrument (e.g. chart recorder) or by manually (indicating instrument). If proper response is not obtained, tune the PID gains until satisfactory result is obtained. Normally, this procedure may be performed with no load condition first (repeat step change response with load condition if necessary). For more information about step change response, see MONITORING and CONTROL part of this section

 when [Auto Estimation] button located on right top screen is pressed. Few generator parameters listed below are used for calculation control gains.
 DC Link Voltage: direct current voltage level of HDEC2000 unit, rectified from excitation power input.
 ExcitationCurrent(open):noloadexcitationcurrent.
 ExcitationCurrent(short):excitationcurrentcorrespondingtoratedgeneratorcurrentwiththreephase

 ExcitationCurrent(Rated):excitationcurrentcorrespondingtonominalgeneratorload.
 ExciterResistance:excitationwindingresistance.
 Td’(Un): direct axis transient short circuit time constant (saturated value).
 Tdo’:directaxistransientopencircuittimeconstant.
 Te:excitertimeconstant.
Five parameters (DC Link Voltage, three components of excitation current and exciter resistance) are already entered in the Configuration Tab and Generator Tab. three additional parameters (Td’, Tdo’, Te) are required for calculation, and user must be input those parameters from design data of machine.
At this screen, HDCM software calculates PID gains of all regulation and limitation mode if [Calculation] button is pressed. Next, [Update PID] button is used to replace the PID gains of Gain-Tab’s screen with newly calculated PID gains. Be sure, the calculated PID gains are only roughly estimated value. The optimum PID gain may be obtained from tuning with actual operating condition.
Do not use the function (PID auto estimation) while the generator is in normal service (loaded condition), It causes impact (or damage) to the generator or system due to sudden change of many control gains at same time.
Control Gain Description
 AVRModeKG:Determinesscaling(orloop)gainofsoftwarefunctionblockforAVRmode.Generally, this gain determines the overall response of feedback loop. Below formula is applied for AVR mode loop gain calculation. However to obtain more fast (or stable) response, the AVR loop gain may be adjusted in a range of between 50 and 300% of calculated value.
AVR Mode KG = 100 * UEO / DC Link Voltage [%]
Where: UEO is excitation voltage corresponding to rated generator voltage with no load condition in Volts.
DC Link Voltage is internally rectified voltage from excitation power input in Volts.
 AVRModeKP:DeterminesproportionalgainofsoftwarefunctionblockforAVRmode.Generally,this gain improves transient response, but too high, the transient response has much overshoot. In normal case, this gain may be increased if machine size (time constant) is increase.
 AVR Mode KI: Determines the Integral gain of software function block for AVR mode. Generally, this gain improves recovery speed of transient response and control accuracy of steady state. But too high, the transient response has overshoot. In normal case, the typically range is 50 ... 200 and this gain may be gradually decreased if machine size (time constant) is increased. Other gains may be determined
    CAUTION

from generator parameter. However, AVR Mode KI may be determined from generator parameter and
other control gain(s).
 AVR Mode KD: Determines derivative gain of software function block for AVR mode. Generally, this gain
improves steady state stability and initial response. But too high, unstable fluctuation may be occurred with steady state and the recovery speed may be very poor. If main machine and exciter machine time constants are increased, this gain may be increased also.
 AVR Mode TH: Determines sampling interval of derivation error (the variation slope of generator voltage) calculation. Shorter TH improves the dynamic response of system. But too short, the system may be unstable in case of system has much sensing noise. If main machine time constant is increased, increase this parameter (time interval).
 AVR Mode TF: Determines the filtering time constant of derivation error. TF reduce (improves) the influence of much sensing noise of system and increases stability. But too high, the dynamic response is decreased and system stability is also decreased due to the time delay of derivative action. Typically, 0 ...100% of AVR mode TH is applicable depending of sensing noise.
 FCRModeKG:scaling(orloop)gainofsoftwarefunctionblockforFCRmode.Generally,thisgain determines the overall response of feedback loop. Below formula is applied for FCR mode loop gain calculation.
FCR Mode KG = 100 * UEN / DC Link Voltage [%]
Where: UEN is rated excitation voltage calculated from rated excitation current and exciter field resistance in Volts.

INTRODUCTION
SECTION 6. COMMISSIONING
This section describes the site commissioning procedure of generator and excitation system. However, it is not possible to mention for all possible application. AVR mode generic operation guide may be dealt in this section because HDEC2000 unit operates with AVR mode in most cases.
On site commissioning should be performed by qualified personnel who has fully understanding of HDEC2000 unit and has intermediate or higher level knowledge for synchronous machine, excitation system and application.
HDEC 2000 User Manual Rev. D
  !
COMMISSIONING
  DANGER
   Note!
The commissioning procedure of this section is not unconditionally obeyed but can be changed.
And some procedure may be omitted or additional procedure may be necessary depending on the site condition, (kind of load, prime-mover ...), commissioning engineer or the schedule of application.
Procedure A: Initial Checkout while machine is at a standstill
(1) Verify that all safety measures have been taken.
(2) Inspect physical installation by visually.
(3) Inspect all wiring of HDEC2000 unit and related components (generator, sensing transformer ...).
(4) Inspect that the grounding wiring is correctly connected.
(5) Review the generator nameplate, test report of generator or design data.
(6) Supply external control power (not excitation power). If control power is not supplied permanently, then
temporarily supply (use D1, D2 terminals).
(7) Make communication connection between HDEC2000 unit and setup computer (note book).
(8) Check (or newly configure) all configuration parameters according to schematic drawing, system
design and application requirement.
(9) Write all configuration parameter into the EEPROM of HDEC2000 unit and backup to setup computer
storage.
(10) Disconnect control power (if control power is supplied temporarily) (11) If no problem is found yet, process next procedure.
Procedure B: Checkout before startup to voltage buildup
(1) Open the FCR select command digital input (Select AVR Mode).
(2) Open the excitation on command digital input (Excitation OFF)
(3) Turn off the excitation input circuit breaker if circuit breaker is permanently installed.
 Note!
If the HDEC2000 unit is supplied as a part of synchronous generator system by Hyundai Heavy Industrial Co., Ltd, parameter configuration while standstill can be omitted.
 Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd 92 Electro Electric Systems

HDEC 2000 User Manual Rev. D
 (4) Turn off the SW2 for hardware voltage buildup function, installed on the right panel of HDEC2000 unit.
(5) Startup the prime-mover
(6) Measure excitation input voltage before closing the excitation input circuit breaker. After measuring,
verify that the measured input is not exceeded permissible value and it meets design data by below criterion.
- PMG application: compare it with PMG test data or PMG design data.
- Shunt application: compare it with expected value measured from other device by using
excitation transformer turn ratio.
- Utility supply: compare measured value with design data.
(7) Measure input sensing voltage (generator residual voltage). And compare it with expected value (from other measuring device.
(8) Turn on the excitation input circuit breaker if available.
In case of PMG, Utility excitation power, or external control power is supplied, verify that the nearly same value obtained between displayed generator voltage on the front panel of HDEC2000 unit and the values measured from other instrument.
(9) Incaseofshuntpowerapplicationwithnoexternalcontrolpower,turnontheSW2forhardwarevoltage buildup function installed on the right panel of HDEC2000, then the possible lowest voltage (approximately 15 ... 20% depending on the turn ratio of excitation transformer) may be controlled by HDEC2000 unit. In this step, some initial voltage overshoot not exceeding nominal value may be occurred depending on generator or excitation transformer
(10) Close the excitation on command input (excitation on)
(11) Monitor the generator voltage buildup condition. If voltage is increased too rapidly, open the excitation
on digital input circuit (Excitation OFF) and remove excitation power (or stop the prime-mover). (12) If smooth voltage buildup is obtained while [Soft Start Time], process next procedure.
Procedure C: Checkout while no load running
(1) Monitor the stability of generator voltage, if the unstable voltage is obtained, check the control gains or others.
(2) Measure and record excitation current with nominal voltage condition. And compare it with design data or test data (if available).
(3) Adjust setpoint from minimum setpoint to maximum setpoint.
(4) Measure and record generator voltage adjustable boundary.
(5) Adjust generator voltage with nominal value.
(6) Wait at least few minutes. If operating condition suddenly changed, then check the reason(s).
(7) Change Setpoint (-5 ... -10% of nominal) suddenly by using HDCM software, and monitor voltage step response.
(8) ChangeSetpointtonominalvalue(100%)suddenlybyusingHDCMsoftware,andmonitorvoltagestep response.
 Note!
If the HDEC2000 unit is already configured by generator (and excitation) system supplier, the no load voltage step response procedure (procedure No. 7 ...9 described below) can be omitted.
 Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd 93 Electro Electric Systems

(9) If voltage step response is too slow (or too fast), then tune the control gain(s) until proper response is obtained. For more detailed procedure about control gain tuning, see section 4 (Configuration).
(10) If no problem is found yet, process next procedure.
Procedure D: Checkout while load condition (Single or parallel operation, connected with island grid)
(1) Close main circuit breaker according to synchronization procedure if necessary. If parallel operation is
applied, adjust the generator no load voltage same as the no load voltage of others before circuit
breaker closing.
(2) With Light load condition, Record the important measuring parameter displayed on the front panel of
HDEC2000. And compare it with other recording obtained from other instrument.
(3) Slowly increase the load to the possible maximum value step by step (if possible).
(4) Record all important measuring parameter with each load step.
(5) If other generator(s) is paralleled, check reactive load sharing of each generator(s).
(6) If unequal load sharing is obtained, check configuration parameter (Setpoint of each generator,
Reactive Droop or CCC Droop) or others.
(7) Monitor the stability of generator voltage, if voltage is unstable, check control gain or others.
(8) Wait at least few minutes. If operating condition suddenly changed, check the reason(s).
(9) If no problem is found yet, write your final configuration parameter on the EEPROM of HDEC2000 unit
and backup to your computer storage also.
Procedure E: Checkout while load condition (Parallel operation, with VAR/PF operating mode)
(1) Before synchronization, please check listed below
- Reactive Droop parameter: not less than 4%
- CCC Enabled: disabled
- VAR/PF mode: VAR of PF mode is enabled
- UEL Enabled: Enabled
- OEL Enabled: Enabled
- Related parameter of UEL, OEL: properly configured.
- MCB status input terminal: connected with generator circuit breaker (normal open logic)
- GCB status input terminal: connected with grid circuit breaker or logical combination contact of
system breaker contactors (normal open logic)
(2) Close main circuit breaker according to synchronization procedure.
(3) At the moment of breaker closing, monitor the generator current, excitation current, reactive power and
operating mode display carefully.
(4) If any of below condition is obtained, open the generator circuit breaker immediately. And check the

machine(s) (the generator is connected with large power grid, not the small island grid).
 
- Sudden increasing of generator current, Sudden increasing (or decreasing) of excitation current or reactive power
- Operating mode is not change to VAR mode or PF mode from AVR mode
(5) If PF mode is selected, carry out follows:
- Increase the load not higher than about 30% (if possible)
- Monitor the power factor of HDEC2000 and compare it with setpoint and other available value.
If comparing result is not nearly same then check the reason(s).
- Increase the setpoint slowly (about 0.05pu lower than original setpoint), then the actual power
factor decreasing (increasing of reactive power) is obtained. And next, re-adjust the setpoint to
the original value
(6) If VAR mode is selected, carry out follows:
- Monitor the reactive power value. And compare it with setpoint and other available value. If comparing result is not nearly same then check the reason(s).
- Decrease the setpoint slowly (about 0.05... 0.1pu lower than original setpoint) but not less than zero (under excitation region), then the actual reactive power decreasing is obtained. And next, re-adjust the setpoint to original value.
(7) Slowly increase the load to possible maximum value, step by step.
(8) Record all important parameter (voltage, excitation current ...) with each load step.
(9) Monitor the generator reactive power or power factor stability, if the result is unstable, check control
gain or others.
(10) Wait at least few minutes. If operating condition is suddenly changed, check reason(s).
(11) If no problem(s) is found yet, write your final configuration parameter on the EEPROM of HDEC2000
unit and backup to your computer storage also.
HDEC 2000 User Manual Rev. D
   IMPORTANT
While light load (less than 10% approximately) with the PF mode, the power factor may be unstable due to the active power change, even though the fluctuation of active power is very small. For this reason, control gain must be tuned with the load condition not less than approximately 30% of nominal.

(*1): Even though the voltage setpoint of all generators are same, the generator no load voltage may be different due to sensing VT error. Primary important thing is same generator voltage than same voltage setpoint.
 (*2): If very little (ex: lower than 0.5% of nominal) ratio error is present and very low Reactive Droop or CCC Droop (ex: typically lower than 2.5%) is configured simultaneously, unequal reactive power sharing may be obtained.
In this case, Check other possible causes first and any failure is not found, adjust voltage setpoint until equal reactive power sharing is obtained. If approximately same reactive load sharing is obtained with two different load points after voltage setpoint is adjusted, the unequal reactive load sharing is caused from little sensing VT ratio error.
If the unequal reactive load sharing is caused from sensing VT ratio and it is confirmed, store the corrective voltage setpoint into the EEPROM of HDEC2000 unit to avoid same situation when generator is re-started.

General
This appendix describes the mathematical model of HDEC2000 unit’s software controller (function block).
All detailed information of mathematical model (e.g. setpoint tracking model) is not mentioned in this appendix, but the major and important math model is only described for understanding. The exciter machine model is shortly described in this appendix since there is no responsibility by voltage regulator.
The most of mathematical models are designed based on the IEEE421.5-2005. However, all elements are not perfectly same as IEEE standard due to some modification of math model through the performance improvement and configuration convenience.
If not specified, all parameters (or gains) are expressed as per unit quantities (based on rated generator voltage, rated generator current and rated excitation current) and seconds. However, in case of base excitation current, the no load excitation current or air gap line excitation current may be used together with rated excitation current because of the convenience of use. All gains and time constants mentioned in this appendix can be estimated and configured by the use of setup software.
Simplified overall functional block diagram (some elements are omitted for the purpose of simplification) of HDEC2000 voltage regulator is shown in Figure B-1.
The overall control block consists of cascade structure. The AVR, FCR, OEL and SCL controllers are positioned to the inner loop and others are positioned to the outer loop.

Where: VT = Measured generator terminal voltage
IQ = Reactive component of generator current, IT * sin(φ), sin(φ) means reactive power factor. XC = Reactive Droop (positive: reactive droop, negative: line drop or transformer drop)
TR = Time delay of sensing process including hardware filter circuit, typically 8 ...10ms Reactive Droop is configuration parameter of HDEC2000 unit in [pu]
The vector sum of generator voltage and imaginary reactive voltage drop is transferred to feedback loop of AVR controller. This leads that the generator terminal voltage drop is linearly proportional to generator reactive power (or reactive current).
If cross current compensation (CCC) function is enabled, the reactive current (IQ) and Reactive Droop (XC) are replaced by present unbalanced reactive current and [CCC Droop] configuration parameter.
Automatic Voltage Regulation Model with Exciter Machine
The block diagram of AVR controller designed under the basis of the AC8B model of IEEE421.5 with brushless rotating exciter model (AC5A model of IEEE 421.5 standard) is shown in Figure B-3. The AVR controller is PID controller having scaling (loop) gain Kg, proportional (KP), integral (KI) and derivative (KD) gains. And all of four gains are adjustable depending on excitation system configuration and machine (main and exciter) characteristic (time constant and reactance).
The combination of AC8B (regulator) and AC5A (exciter) model has been widely adopted in the industrial application for the purpose of modeling due to the simple structure of AC5A exciter model rather than the complex AC8B exciter model, or due to the un-availability of detailed information of exciter.

In case of modeling with complete AC8B excitation system model, below modifications may be applied.
 The diode rectifier model may be added.
 The term of EFD (field voltage of AC5A model) may be replaced by VEX (exciter armature voltage).
 The saturation factor SE(EFD) may be replaced by SE(VEX), and obtained from no load saturation curve .
(The saturation factor is obtained from load saturation curve in case of AC5A model).
 One more feedback loop (gain KD loop of exciter) for compensating armature reaction may be added.
The maximum output voltage VRMAX of voltage regulator is equal to DC Link Voltage, and below formulas can be roughly applied for DC Link Voltage calculation. Also these rules can be applied in case of FCR model.
DC Link Voltage = 1.41* input ac voltage for three phase excitation power DC Link Voltage = 1.25 * input ac voltage for single phase excitation power DC Link Voltage = 0.98 * input dc voltage for dc power supplied
The term of Dc Link Voltage is: internal dc excitation power voltage of regulator through rectification and smoothing process from excitation input power
The time delay TA in the hardware power stage including software code executing interval is typically zero due to high switching frequency of power module (IGBT) compared with generator and exciter time constant.
The loop gain KG determines the overall response of AVR feedback loop. Generally, this loop gain depending on excitation input power voltage (VP) and the no load excitation voltage is obtained from below formula. But to obtain more fast (or stable) response, the AVR loop gain may be adjusted in a range of between 50 and 300% of calculated value.
KG = UEO / DC Link Voltage
Where: UEO is excitation voltage corresponding to rated generator voltage with no load in [V] DC Link Voltage is internally rectified voltage from excitation power input in [V]
The PID gains KP, KI and KD are custom designed for the best performance for each generator and exciter system and can be estimated by setup software. The filtering time constant TF is used for reducing (improving) the influence caused from feedback loop sensing noise and typically zero for the purpose of modeling.
Field Current Regulation Model
The block diagram of FCR controller is shown in Figure B-4. The model of rotating exciter same as mentioned above (the exciter model in Figure B-3) is not shown. The FCR controller is PI controller having scaling (loop) gain KG, proportional (KP) and integral (KI) gains, and all three gains are adjustable. If AVR operating mode is selected, the FCR control block is disabled.
The loop gain KG determines the overall response of FCR feedback loop. Generally, the loop gain depending on excitation input power voltage (VP) and the nominal excitation voltage can be obtained from below formula. KG = UEN / DC Link Voltage [pu]
Where: UEN is the nominal excitation voltage in [V]
DC Link Voltage is internally rectified voltage from excitation power input in [V]

Figure B-4 Block Diagram of FCR Controller
The block diagram of VAR controller is shown in Figure B-5. The VAR controller is type II summing type PI controller of IEEE421.5. And the controller is positioned to the outer loop of cascade structure. If FCR operating mode is selected, the VAR control block is disabled. The VAR/PF controller cannot be enabled in the voltage supporting machine (see IEEE421.5) but can be enabled in the voltage following machine.
The control output (VVAR) of VAR controller is summed with setpoint (reference) of AVR controller, and the VAR controller operates slowly compared with AVR controller. The VAR control block consists of scaling (loop) gain (KG) &amp; integral gain (KI), and both gains are adjustable. Two gains are tuned so that the control action may have slow response.

The block diagram of power factor (PF) controller is shown in Figure B-6. The PF controller is type II summing type PI controller of IEEE421.5. The PF controller is same as VAR controller except PF setpoint (PF reference) input.
The PF setpoint is transferred to the summing point of PF controller through conversion process (from PF reference to VAR reference by using of present active power and PF reference) to obtain PI gain similar with VAR controller.

The control output (VOEL) of OEL controller is summed with the control output of AVR controller. The OEL control block consists of scaling (loop) gain (KG) and integral (KI) gain, and two gains are adjustable.
The operating characteristics of OEL controller are designed with three constant (configurable) limiting levels and two constant (configurable) time delays. If the excitation current exceeds the allowable safe level (and if the level is maintained for the duration of pre-defined delay time), the excitation current may be reduced (limited) instantaneously up to the OEL reference by mean of OEL reference reduction. The operating characteristic is shown in Figure B-8.

When the excitation current is decreased lower than the limitation level (limiting level 3 in Figure-B8) by external load reducing or by external condition change, the control output of OEL block is not immediately returned to zero level but gradually returned to zero to prevent much voltage overshoot due to the sudden changing of control output. Also, in this case, the limiting level-3 is maintained as OEL reference for duration of cool-down time, and cool-down time is depending on control output of OEL controller.
Stator Current Limiter Model
The block diagram of SCL controller is shown in Figure B-9. The SCL controller is summing type PI controller having two control gains (proportional gain KP and integral gain KI) two control gains are adjustable. The controller is positioned to the inner loop of cascade structure, and the control output is summed with the control output of AVR controller. If FCR operating mode is selected, the SCL control block is disabled.
The operating characteristics of SCL controller are designed with two constant (configurable) limiting levels and one constant (configurable) time delays. The typical SCL curve is shown in Figure B-8.

 The SCL controller reduces the control output if the stator current exceeds the predefined safe operation level and the measured reactive power is higher than minimum specified reactive power (QM in the block diagram). Even though, the stator current exceeds the limitation level with under excitation region (or actual reactive power is less than minimum specified level), the SCL controller disregards the excessive current. In case of under excitation condition, the UEL controller may be used instead of SCL controller due to the inherent characteristics of synchronous machine (normally, the exceeded current over than nominal value is not permitted with under excitation condition, however the SCL limitation level may be settled with higher than nominal value).
In case of permanent single operation (not paralleled), If the generator is operated with passive load such as lighting load, and the minimum specified reactive power is settled with zero, the SCL controller disregards the under excitation (or less reactive power) condition.
When the stator current is decreased lower than the limitation level (limiting level 2 in Figure-B8) by load reducing or other external condition change, the reset characteristic of control output is similar to OEL controller.

The block diagram (UEL reference block is simplified) of UEL controller is shown in Figure B-10. The UEL controller is summing type PI controller, and the controller is positioned to the outer loop of cascade structure. If FCR operating mode is selected, the UEL control block is disabled.
The control output (VUEL) of UEL controller is summed with the setpoint (reference) of AVR controller. The UEL control block consists of scaling (loop) gain (KG) and integral gain (KI), and both gains are adjustable.
The PI gains KG and KI may be tuned to the higher level than the gains of VAR/PF controller in order to get out from the unstable operating condition when the generator reactive power is lower than the UEL reference.

 The HDEC2000 regulator supports both types of UEL model (type UEL1 and type UEL2) of IEEE 421.5 standard, and only one UEL model is selected by user. The first type UEL1 (called with circular characteristic UEL) is corresponding to the Circular UEL of HDEC2000 regulator and the second type UEL2 (called with piecewise linear UEL or multi segment UEL) is corresponding to Segment UEL of HDEC2000 regulator. The typical UEL curves of two UEL models are shown in Figure B-11, and the typical Circular UEL curve with different voltage level is shown in Figure B-12.
Any case of UEL model selection, the UEL reference is not fixed but calculated (or interpolated) value based on the present active power, generator voltage and pre-defined reactive power segments configured by user (and active power segments configured by user in case of UEL2).
If generator reactive power is lower than the calculated UEL reference, the excitation current may be increased until the reactive power is above UEL reference.
Soft Start Function Model
The block diagram of soft start function is shown in Figure B-13. Soft start function block is enabled in both cases of AVR mode and FCR mode. The control output of soft start function block is summed with the setpoint of AVR controller (and FCR controller).
The soft start function block is designed for smoothing generator voltage buildup with minimal overshoot while desired time from excitation on event.

When excitation on command is detected, the soft start function block linearly increases the AVR setpoint from Soft Start Level (VSS) to nominal AVR Setpoint through Soft Start Time (TSS). The both parameters (soft start level and soft start time) are adjustable. In case of FCR mode, the soft start function block reduces FCR Setpoint based on the soft start level (VSS).

Microwave instruments use microwaves to take survey measurements. They have a range up to 100 km and are comprised of two identical units, a master unit, and a remote unit.
Infrared wave instruments use amplitude modulated infrared waves and prism reflectors. They have a range up to 3 km and accuracy of +/- 10mm.
Light wave instruments rely on the propagation of modulated light waves. Their accuracy varies from 0.5mm to 5mm/km, and they have a daytime range of 3km and night range of 2.5km.
Laser measuring tools send a beam to the target, which reflects off the surface and is sent back to the device. Lasers are focused beams of light that stay at a particular frequency. And because they travel from one place to another at a fairly constant rate, they can be used to measure distance with a great deal of accuracy. A laser measuring device also has a longer range than many other measuring tools, which gives it an advantage over other devices that become less precise the farther out you measure. Lasers are less likely to disperse than white light, so they can travel at a greater distance without losing their intensity. They keep most of their intensity once they reflect off a target, which is important if you want to get accurate distance measurements.

These instruments allow engineers, sailors, and others to accurately measure lengths and distances according to their respective systems of measurement. It's important to note that many professionals now use digital instruments, such as laser distance measurers, which can provide precise measurements in multiple units.

For example, consider a cold metal bar which is held firmly against a piece of red-hot metal. In a short time, the end of the bar which is not touching the hotter metal will have become too hot to hold. We say that heat has been conducted from molecule to molecule, throughout the entire bar. The process of conduction will continue as long as there is a temperature difference between the two ends of the bar.

            <Title>Starting a Diesel Engine</Title>
            <Text>Diesel engines have as many different types of starting circuits as there are types, sizes, and manufacturers of diesel engines. Commonly, they can be started by air motors, electric motors, hydraulic motors, and manually. The start circuit can be a simple manual start pushbutton, or a complex auto-start circuit. But in almost all cases the following events must occur for the starting engine to start. 
1. The start signal is sent to the starting motor. The air, electric, or hydraulic motor, will engage the engine's flywheel. 
2. The starting motor will crank the engine. The starting motor will spin the engine at a high enough rpm to allow the engine's compression to ignite the fuel and start the engine running. 
3. The engine will then accelerate to idle speed. When the starter motor is overdriven by the running motor it will disengage the flywheel. 
Because a diesel engine relies on compression heat to ignite the fuel, a cold engine can rob enough heat from the gasses that the compressed air falls below the ignition temperature of the fuel. To help overcome this condition, some engines (usually small to medium sized engines) have glowplugs. Glowplugs are located in the cylinder head of the combustion chamber and use electricity to heat up the electrode at the top of the glowplug. The heat added by the glowplug is sufficient to help ignite the fuel in the cold engine. Once the engine is running, the glowplugs are turned off and the heat of combustion is sufficient to heat the block and keep the engine running. 
Larger engines usually heat the block and/or have powerful starting motors that are able to spin the engine long enough to allow the compression heat to fire the engine. Some large engines use air start manifolds that inject compressed air into the cylinders which rotates the engine during the start sequence.

            <Text>First, notify the bridge and slow down to reduce steam demand. Watch the boiler levels carefully and secure them before they go out of sight.

*	Determine the root cause of the problem -- loss of suction or 	pump failure.
*	Restore the DC heater level if necessary.
*	If the pump has tripped and can be restarted, do it.
*	If the pump is vapor bound, restore suction pressure and vent 	the pump, then restart.
*	If the cause is pump failure, start the stand-by feed pump.
*	Check for other causes -- loss of control air, feed pump governor set too low, feedwater recirculation valve open.

In an emergency, water can be supplied to the boiler by taking a cold suction from the reserve feed tanks with the in-port feed pump.  This should not be done until all other methods of providing boiler feedwater have failed.

            <Title>Introduction</Title>
            <Text>Your feet are vulnerable to many potential hazards aboard ship. For example, slips and falls due to wet and slippery decks; heavy objects falling on or rolling over your foot because of the ship’s motion or accident; punctures caused by stepping on sharp objects; and potential electrical shock when your body is grounded through the soles of your shoes. In other industries, there are other hazards to consider, chemical exposure, high temperatures, molten metal splashes, static electricity, to name a few. Proper selection of footwear can minimize the danger of these hazards. 
OSHA has established regulations for safety shoe design, including impact and compression strength requirements, and they have mandated footwear requirements for many industries. For example, safety shoes or boots with impact protection are required to be worn in work areas where carrying or handling materials such as packages, objects, parts or heavy tools, which could be dropped; and for other activities where objects might fall onto the feet. Safety shoes or boots with compression protection are required for work activities involving skid trucks (manual materials handling cars) or other activities in which materials or equipment could potentially roll over an employee’s feet. Safety shoes or boots with puncture protection are required where sharp objects such as nails, wire, tacks, screws, large staples, scrap metal etc., could be stepped on by employees causing a foot injury. Although there are no specific OSHA requirements for safety footwear for marine engineers, it is nonetheless sensible to select and wear safety shoes based on the hazards found in the engine room.

            <Title>Three phase power</Title>
            <Text>Large AC generators including those on the training ship generate three phase power.  Three phase power consists of three identical alternating voltage waveforms 120 degrees out of phase with each other, as shown in &lt;xref ref='fig_three-phase'/&gt;.

 &lt;caption&gt;Three-Phase Voltages&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;image source="images/three-phase" width="75%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Three-phase power is commonly used in industrial and commercial settings, as well as in larger residential complexes and power distribution networks. It's well-suited for heavy machinery, motors, large-scale industrial processes, and high-power applications.
The three voltage sine waves can be separated and used individually to supply single phase power for homes, small businesses, and some light commercial applications. It's suitable for powering lighting, appliances, and smaller electric loads.

            <Text> &lt;em&gt;Power&lt;/em&gt; is the rate of doing work. The amount of work done has nothing at all to do with how long it takes to do it. When you lift a weight of 1 pound through a distance of 1 foot, you have done 1 foot-pound of work, regardless of whether you do it in half a second or half an hour. A device which can do a lot of work quickly is powerful. The common unit of measurement for power is the &lt;em&gt;horsepower&lt;/em&gt; (hp). By definition, 1 horsepower is equal to 33,000 foot-pounds of work per minute or 550 foot-pounds of work per second. Thus a machine that is capable of doing 550 foot-pounds of work per second is said to be a 1-horsepower machine. (As you can see, your horsepower rating would not be very impressive if you did 1 foot-pound of work in half an hour. Figure it out. It works out to be just a little more than one-millionth of a horsepower.)

            <Text>The Engineering Officer of the Watch is responsible for maintaining several logbooks. Every ship will have an  *Engineroom Logbook*, an *Oil Record Book* (ORB), and if not automatically logged, a *Bell Book*.  In addition, the *Kennedy* also maintains a *Maintenance Log*.

The Engineering Log, ORB, and Bell Book are vital, legal documents and should be handled accordingly.  They serve to document the operations carried out aboard ship, and should answer the questions: who? what? where? when? and why? Logbooks will be used by the Coast Guard in any accident, casualty, or spill investigation.  A properly filled out logbook may be able to exonerate you, while a fraudulent one might convict you.

When filling out logbooks, entries are to be printed legibly, using a black pen, and no erasures are permitted.  If a mistake is made, a single line should be drawn through the error and the correction entered and initialed. Entries must be maintained contemporaneously with the events they describe.  Wash your hands before filling out the logbook, and keep the logbook clean.  Sign the logbook at the end of the watch.</Text>

            <Title>Ground Faults</Title>
            <Text>A ground fault occurs when an electric circuit  unintentionally contacts the earth or the ship's hull. This connection allows current to return to the source through an unintended path.
Ground faults are caused by insulation failure due to age, abrasion, abuse, and especially due to moisture, either from the humidity or by direct water impingement. Salt water infiltration is a common cause of ground faults in deck equipment.  When a person accidentally contacts a live wire and ground at the same time, the resulting shock is actually a ground fault.
Aboard ship, we continuously monitor for ground faults using ground lamps and ground ammeters.  When a ground fault is detected the ship’s engineers repair them as soon as possible to prevent bigger problems such as equipment failure.

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Ground lamps, Ground Ammeter&lt;/caption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

Ground faults are different than short circuits because the ground fault current is usually too small to trip a circuit breaker or blow a fuse.  Ground fault circuit interrupters, like those found in your bathroom at home, are designed to detect these small ground currents and quickly open to prevent electrical shock.

            <Text>The stator core is made up of electrically insulated sheets, braced with clamping bolts and rings and mounted in the stator housing. The stator windings consists of layered coils mounted in the open slots of the stator core. The stator has two terminal boxes on the stator housing for electrical connections. 
The rotor is comprised of a forged shaft with a shrunk on rotor body. The rotor windings are formed by bars and rings embedded together and brazed by an induction heating method to form a squirrel cage. 
The rotor is supported with self-lubricated, bushed bearings. There are two jacking oil pumps for the drive end bearings and two jacking oil pumps for the non-drive end bearings, normally with one operating and one in standby. 
The motors are fitted with two air-water heat exchangers providing cooled air which is forced through internal cooling openings via four 440V 9.2 kW electric-motor driven fans. This air is then circulated back to the coolers. In the event of fan failure, it is still possible to operate at a reduced speed.  In the event of cooling water failure, the motor is provided with emergency air openings in the cooler hood and in the stator housing which can be removed for natural cooling.

            <Title>RMS Values</Title>
            <Text>The RMS (Root Mean Square) value is a mathematical concept used to represent the effective or average value of a varying quantity, such as voltage or current, in an AC waveform. It provides a way to express the magnitude of an AC signal in a manner that is equivalent to the magnitude of a DC value. 
AC current and voltage measurements always mean  RMS values rather than peak or instantaneous values unless stated otherwise. For example, when you see the voltage rating on household electrical devices (e.g., 120V for North America), it's the RMS value that's being specified. Similarly, the current rating (e.g., 15A) refers to the RMS value of the current.
For a sinusoidal waveform (like the standard AC power supply waveform), the RMS value is approximately 1/\sqrt{2} =  0.707 times the peak value of the waveform.  &lt;me&gt;V_{\text{RMS}} = \frac{V_{\text{peak}}}{\sqrt{2}}\qquad V_{\text{peak}} =V_{\text{RMS}}\sqrt{2}&lt;/me&gt;
The RMS value of an AC voltage is the equivalent steady DC voltage that would produce the same amount of power dissipation across a resistor as the AC voltage across the same resistor. In other words, it's the voltage that gives the same heating effect as the AC voltage. Similarly, the RMS value of an AC current is the equivalent steady DC current that would produce the same power dissipation in a resistor as the AC current through the same resistor.

            <Title>TORR</Title>
            <Text>TORR 
1 atmosphere of pressure at sea level is equal to 760 torr. The torr is named after the Italian physicist Evangelista Torricelli (&lt;em&gt;1608 – 1647&lt;/em&gt;), who invented the mercury barometer. When Torricelli first used mercury to measure atmospheric pressure, he found that the pressure supported a column of mercury about 760 millimeters high and 1 torr being 1 mm in height of Hg. 760 mmHg is equivalent to 29.92 inches. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Mercury Barometer&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image14.png"/&gt;

1 atm = 14.7 psia, 101.325 kPa 
1atm =760 mmHg 
760 torr = 101.325 kPa 
760 torr = 14.7 psia 
29.92 in hg =14.7psi 
Example Problem 
Meteorologists state that a “falling” barometer indicates an approaching storm. Given a barometric pressure of 27.5 in. Hg, express the pressure in each of the following units of pressure: 
a. Atmospheres 
b. mmHg 
c. kPa 
d. psi 
Solution 
For each conversion, we apply a unit conversion factor related to units of standard pressure. 
(a) To express the pressure in atmospheres, we derive a unit factor related to the equivalent relationship, 29.9 inHg = 1 atm. 
27.5 inHg X \frac{1atm}{29.92inHg} = 0.9 atm 
(b) To convert to millimeters of mercury, we derive a unit factor related to the equivalent relationship, 29.9 inHg = 760 mmHg. 
27.5 inHg x \frac{760mmHg}{29.92inHg}= 699 mmHg 
(c) To find the pressure in kilopascals, we derive a unit factor related to the equivalent relationship 
29.9 inHg = 101.325 kPa. 
27.5 inHg X \frac{101.325kPa}{29.92inHg} = 93kPa 
To calculate the pressure in pounds per square inch, we derive a unit factor related to the equivalent relationship, 29.9 inHg = 14.7 psi.

            <Title>Absolute Pressure</Title>
            <Text>Pressure measured on a scale increasing from zero at a perfect vacuum is known as absolute pressure. Absolute pressure is always higher than the corresponding gage pressure by the amount of the atmospheric pressure. For shipboard purposes, you can simply add 14.7 psi to the gage reading in psi to get the absolute pressure. For example, a gage pressure of 100 psig would be the same as an absolute pressure of 114.7 psia. 
We sometimes say psig to indicate gage pressure and other times we merely say psi. By common convention, gage pressure is always assumed when pressure is given in pounds per square inch, pounds per square foot, or similar units. The &lt;q&gt;g&lt;/q&gt; (for gage) is added only when there is some possibility of confusion. Absolute pressure, on the other hand, is always expressed as pounds per square inch absolute (psia), pounds per square foot absolute (psfa), and so forth. It is always necessary to establish clearly just what kind of pressure we are talking about, unless this is very clear from the nature of the discussion.

            <Text>The most commonly used temperature scale in the US today is the Fahrenheit scale, abbreviated F. In this scale, water freezes at 32 degrees and boils at 212 degrees. (This only holds strictly when atmospheric pressure equals the average sea level pressure. At high altitudes, water boils at a lower temperature, as anyone who cooks in the mountains knows.) 
Another common scale is the Celsius scale. In this scale, water freezes at 0 degrees and boils at 100 degrees. 
There are also temperature scales in which zero is absolute zero, the lowest possible temperature. (People have gotten close to absolute zero, but have never reached it. According to theory, we never will.) Absolute zero is at -273.15 Celsius, or -459.67 Fahrenheit. 
The Kelvin temperature scale uses the same size degree as Celsius, but has its zero set to absolute zero. 
The Rankine temperature scale uses the same size degree as Fahrenheit, but has its zero set to absolute zero 
The Celsius and Kelvin scales are part of the International System of Units (SI), providing a standardized and widely adopted system for expressing temperatures. Celsius is the more common scale for everyday use, while Kelvin is often used in scientific and thermodynamic calculations.

            <Title>Fuel System</Title>
            <Text>All diesel engines require a method to store and deliver fuel to the engine. Because diesel engines rely on injectors which are precision components with extremely tight tolerances and very small injection hole(s), the fuel delivered to the engine must be extremely clean and free of contaminants. The fuel system must, therefore, not only deliver the fuel but also ensure its cleanliness. This is usually accomplished through a series of in-line filters. Commonly, the fuel will be filtered once outside the engine and then the fuel will pass through at least one more filter internal to the engine, usually located in the fuel line at each fuel injector. In a diesel engine, the fuel system is much more complex than the fuel system on a simple gasoline engine because the fuel serves two purposes. Figure 13 Diesel Engine Fuel Flow path, one purpose is obviously to supply the fuel to run the engine; the other is to act as a coolant to the injectors. To meet this second purpose, diesel fuel is kept continuously flowing through the engine's fuel system at a flow rate much higher than required to simply run the engine, an example of a fuel flow path is shown in Figure 13. The excess fuel is routed back to the fuel pump or the fuel storage tank depending on the application.

Gage glasses, also known as sight glasses, provide a transparent window into the tank, allowing for direct visual observation of the liquid level inside.  The glass tube on a coffee urn is an example.
Mechanical level gauges use a float  attached to a pointer through a pulley system. As the liquid level changes, the float moves, causing the pointer to indicate the new level. 
Differential Pressure level gauges measure the pressure difference between two points in the tank to determine the liquid level.
Pneumercator or bubbler gages operate based on hydrostatic pressure measurement. A bubbler system introduces a small amount of air at a near constant flow rate into the liquid through a dip tube to the bottom of the liquid. The pressure required to overcome the liquid head is measured and translated into a liquid level reading. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Pneumercator (Bubbler) Gage&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/bubbler.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Ultrasonic level gauges function similarly to echo sounders. They emit ultrasonic waves from the gauge, which travel through the liquid and reflect off the surface. The sensor detects the time it takes for the echo to return, and a microprocessor then calculates the distance between the sensor and the liquid surface. These gauges are known for their accurate, non-contact measurement capabilities.</Text>

Clamp-on ammeters are hand-held instruments used to measure AC currents. A plier-like pick-up coil is closed around the conductor in which current is to be measured, and the movement responds to current induced in the pick-up coil by the changing magnetic field surrounding the conductor.  Clamp-on meters are preferable to digital multimeters for measuring currents because the don’t require the circuit to be disturbed to use, and they can measure larger currents than a DMM, however, because they depend on a changing magnetic field they do not work with DC currents.

            <Title>Stop Check</Title>
            <Text>A stop-check valve is very similar to a globe valve, except that the disk is not   attached to the stem. When the valve hand-wheel is turned to the fully closed position   the disk is held against the seat and the valve is securely closed. When the valve   hand-wheel is turned to open the valve, the disk is free to lift off the seat, and will   when there is a pressure difference in the correct direction. If the flow reverses   direction, the valve will automatically close like a lift check valve. 
The valve stem can be used to force the disk to a partially closed position to   regulate the flow, or to a fully closed position to stop the flow, but the valve stem   cannot be used to force the disk into the open position. Once the stem is moved away   from the disk, the valve functions like a lift check valve. 
A typical application would be a boiler feedwater stop-check valve. The valve can be   used to stop or regulate feedwater flow to the boiler. It also automatically prevents   the back flow of water out of the boiler through the feedwater line if the pressure in   the feedwater line falls below the boiler steam pressure. In this application, it   functions as a check valve. 
In some designs, a stop-check valve can be converted to a regular globe valve, which   eliminates the check function and allows the disk to be forced into the open position,   by reinstalling the disk nut or drilling a hole through the upper disk and valve stem   and inserting a pin to lock them together.

            <Text>An overview of the electric propulsion system of the Patriot State II is shown in the one-line diagram below, &lt;xref ref="propulsion_system"/&gt;.
Electrical power for both propulsion and ship’s services is produced by four Hyundai HSJ9 913-08P diesel driven generators.    These are 6600 Volt, three-phase AC synchronous generators capable of producing up to 4053 kW at 80% power factor, or 5066.25 kVA. 
Generators 1 and 2 are located in engineroom 1 and directly feed main switchboard No.1, and generators 3 and 4 are located in engine room 2 and feed main switchboard No. 2.  The switchboards can be split or cross-connected as necessary for emergency operations.

&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

Each switchboard supplies electrical power at 60 Hz, 1850 Volts to a Propulsion Converter via a step-down transformer. The purpose of the propulsion converters is to change input voltage and frequency to the voltage and frequency needed to spin the propulsion motor in the desired direction, at the desired speed, as ordered by the bridge. 
Each propulsion converter provides power to a Propulsion Motor.  The two propulsion motors drive a common shaft which is directly connected to the ship’s single propeller, as shown in &lt;xref ref="DriveTrain"/&gt;.  
The generators, transformers, propulsion converters, and propulsion motors will be discussed in more detail in the sections that follow.</Text>

The term press pack refers to the physical packaging of electronic components.  It typically consists of a semiconductor chip,  along with its associated control and protection circuitry, mounted between two metal plates which serve as electrical contacts and provide mechanical support.

For example, a person sitting near a hot stove is warmed by radiant heat even though the air between the person and the stove may remain cold. Similarly, radiant heat from the sun warms the earth without warming the space through which it passes.

            <Text>
A Resistance Temperature Detector or RTD is a device that determines the temperature of an object by measuring the electrical resistance of a sensing element, The sensors resistance changes linearly as a function of temperature, increasing as the temperature rises and decreasing when the sensor cools.
Most RTDs are either wire wound or thin film types Wire wound RTDs use a fine platinum wire wrapped around a glass or ceramic core, while thin film RTDs use a base ceramic element with a platinum track deposited on it. In either case, the sensing element normally housed in a protective probe to protect them from the environment they are immersed in and to make them more robust.  
While thermocouples and RTDs both measure temperature, there are several differences between the two methods, such as:&lt;ol&gt;
Thermocouples are usually smaller than RTDs, making them easier to use.
Thermocouples (-200 to 2000°C) offer a wider range of temperature operation than RTDs (-200 to 600° C). This means that thermocouples are suitable for more applications.
Thermocouples offer a response time between 0.1 and 10s which is faster than the response time of RTD sensors.
RTDs can self-heat while this issue is negligible with the thermocouples.
Thermocouplesare more sensitive than RTD temperature sensors. This is so because these react faster than RTDs with the variation in temperature.
For thermocouples, the graph between resistance and temperature is not linear, while an RTD is linear. 
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This way the valve   will close even if the flow reversal is only slight. Swing checks are normally installed   in piping systems with the cap up, and lift checks are installed with the disks closing   in the downward direction. There is usually a directional arrow on the valve body which   indicates the direction of fluid flow.

            <Title>Manual Sounding</Title>
            <Text>Many of the ship's tanks are sounded manually.
All important tanks on ships are provided with sounding tubes, tubes which extend from the top of the tank to the bottom.  A crew member can lower a flexible sounding tape down the tube to measure the level in the tank manually.  Sounding tapes are normally made of brass and steel, and consist of a spool, a flexible tape measure, and a weighted bob attached at the end of the tape.   
The sounding tape can be used in either of two ways.  An innage is a measurement from the top of the liquid to the bottom of the sounding tube, while an ullage is a measurement from the top of the sounding tube to the surface of the liquid. Either method will reveal how full or empty the tank is.  
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Innage and Ullage measurements&lt;/caption&gt;
  &lt;image width="50%" source="images/innage-ullage.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
An ullage bob has a cupped end which will produce a "popping" sound that can be heard from the top of the sounding tube when it is bounced on the liquid surface.  When taking an ullage, try to locate the top surface without dropping the tape too deep.
An innage bob has a pointed end, and is used by dropping the tape to the bottom of the tank and noting where the liquid (or cut)  line appears, much like using a dipstick in your car.  The cut line is easier to detect in oil tanks than in water tanks.  The innage bob has a ruler marked on it, which can be used to measure the depth of any water at the bottom of oil tanks by coating the bob with chalk, which will change color if it enters water.  
When you finish using a sounding tape on an oil tank, you must wipe the oil off the tape before putting it away. Ullage soundings don't leave as much oil on the tape, so they are often preferred for oil tanks. 

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/sidebyside&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Although knowing the tank level is sufficient for many purposes, the actual volume of the contents in gallons or tons can be looked up in the Tank Tables.  These tables, which depend on the specific shape of each tank, relate tank level to volume. For highly accurate results, the list and trim of the ship and the temperature of the contents (which affects its density) must be taken into account.

            <Title> Torque </Title>
            <Text>
   &lt;em&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/em&gt;
Torque is a measure of the force that can cause an object to rotate about an axis. The example of opening a door offers an intuitive understanding of torque. When a person opens a door, they push on the side of the door farthest from the hinges. Pushing on the side closest to the hinges requires considerably more force. Although the work done is the same in both cases (the larger force would be applied over a smaller distance), people generally prefer to apply less force, hence the usual location of the door handle. 
Torque is the rotational equivalent of force. It is the measure of the tendency of a force to rotate an object around an axis of rotation. In simpler terms, torque is the turning force that causes an object to rotate, turn or twist. Imagine you're trying to turn a wheel. You need to apply a force to make it spin, right? Torque is the measure of how much force you need to apply to make an object rotate around a turning point. It's measured in Newton meters, or foot-pounds, which is a fancy way of saying how hard you need to push on something and how far away from the turning point you are. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Example of Torque, Screwdriver turning a screw&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image39.png"/&gt;
   Picture 1
&lt;/figure&gt;
Different terminologies, such as moment or moment of force, are interchangeably used to describe torque. 
The distance of the point of application of force from the axis of rotation is called the moment arm or lever arm. See figure below. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Moment Arm&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image40.png"/&gt;
   Picture 83
&lt;/figure&gt;
Direction of Torque 
Understanding the direction of torque is crucial in analyzing rotational dynamics, ensuring the correct application of forces in mechanical systems, and solving problems involving rotational motion. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Direction of torque&lt;/caption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Wrench Turning a Bolt: 
If you apply the force to turn the bolt clockwise, the torque vector points downwards. 
If you apply a force to a wrench to turn a bolt counterclockwise, the torque vector points upwards. 
Rotating a Wheel 
As torque is a vector quantity, both magnitude and direction are needed to define it. The direction of torque can be found using the right-hand rule, where four fingers of the right hand are pointed in the direction of the force F that is applied. The direction of the torque is the same as the direction of the thumb. 
If a force applied to the edge of a wheel causes it to rotate counterclockwise, the torque vector points out of the plane (perpendicular to the wheel's surface). 
If the force causes the wheel to rotate clockwise, the torque vector points into the plane. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Right Hand Rule&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image41.png"/&gt;
   Picture 81
&lt;/figure&gt;
2.2 Units of Torque 
US Standard System: In the US standard system, torque is typically measured in foot-pounds (ft-lb) or inch-pounds (in-lbs.). These units represent the amount of force applied at a specified distance from the rotational axis. For example, one foot-pound of torque is equal to a force of one pound applied at a distance of one foot from the axis of rotation. 
Metric System: In the metric system, torque is measured in newton-meters (N-m) or in some cases, newton-centimeters (N-cm). The newton-meter represents the force (in newtons) applied at a distance of one meter from the rotational axis. Similarly, the newton-centimeter is the force (in newtons) applied at a distance of one centimeter from the axis of rotation. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Units of Torque in Foot-Pounds and Newton-Meters&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image42.png"/&gt;
   Picture 77
&lt;/figure&gt;
Work and Torque 
Like work, torque is a force multiplied by a distance. However, the difference lies in how force and distance are multiplied, and what kind of distance is used in this scenario. For work, the force (&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;) and the distance (&lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;) are multiplied by a dot product. Because it is the dot product of two vectors, it is a scalar value. 
   &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt;=&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;⋅ &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt;=&lt;em&gt;F d cos θ&lt;/em&gt;
Let’s clarify the difference with examples. If there is a box and I am pushing it horizontally, I am doing work on it. If I push it onto an inclined plane to load it onto the back of a truck, it’s still work because the box is not fixed on any particular axis. However, if I take that box and put it on one end of a seesaw, with myself standing at the other, both the box and I are applying torques on the seesaw. The seesaw’s fulcrum fixes it on an axis that causes rotational motion. 
Torques, however, involve rotation along a fixed axis. Therefore, instead of a dot product, we need to use a cross product. We also can’t use the distance d that we applied in the previous work equation because we are not displacing the object a certain distance. We are rotating it along a fixed axis. To calculate torque, we must introduce a new vector, &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; (radius). Physically, &lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; is the distance from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is applied. 
   &lt;em&gt;τ&lt;/em&gt;=&lt;em&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; ×&lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt;= &lt;em&gt;r F sin θ&lt;/em&gt;
Torque (τ⃗) is calculated using the cross product of the position vector (r⃗) and the force vector (F⃗): 
Magnitude of Torque: τ= r⋅ F ⋅ sin (θ) where θ is the angle between the position vector and the force vector. 
Direction of Torque: The direction of τ⃗ is given by the right-hand rule as described above. It is perpendicular to the plane formed by r⃗ and F⃗ 
Torque Formula is given by the cross product between Force and the displacement vector from the pivot point. Thus, mathematically torque can be written as: 
   &lt;em&gt;Torque = Force × Displacement Vector&lt;/em&gt;
   &lt;em&gt;OR&lt;/em&gt;
Torque (τ) = Force (F) × Distance (r) × sin (θ) 
   &lt;em&gt;Where θ is the angle between vector r and vector F.&lt;/em&gt;
τ is the torque. 
F is the force applied. 
r is the distance from the axis of rotation to the point where the force is applied. 
θ is the angle between the lever arm and the direction of the force. 
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Torque Formula with Values&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image44.png"/&gt;
   Examples of Torque
&lt;/figure&gt;
In the above diagram: 
F = 5 N 
r = 4 m 
sin θ = 30° 
Putting in these values we have, 
τ = 5 x 4 x sin 30° 
τ = 10 N · m 
Example 1 
A mechanic applies a force of 400N to a wrench for loosening a bolt. He applies the force which is perpendicular to the arm of the wrench. The distance between the bolt to the hand is 60cm. Find out the torque applied. 
Solution: 
As mentioned in the question that the applied force is perpendicular to the arm of wrench so, the angle will be 90°. 
F = 400N 
r = 60cm = 60⁄100 = .60 
Torque = F × distance × sin θ 
τ = F × r × sin 90° 
τ = 400 × 0.60 × 1 [sin 90° = 1] 
τ = 240 Nm 
Therefore, the magnitude of torque will be 240 Nm. 
   &lt;em&gt;Example 2&lt;/em&gt;
Calculate the Torque on an object from a Force applied at an angle 
A wrench is loosening a bolt, the force applied is 25 Newtons at an angle of 60 degrees relative to the wrench. If the wrench is 30 centimeters long and the force is applied at the end of the wrench, what is the Torque on the bolt? 
Length of lever arm, r, = 30 centimeters, 0.3 meters. 
Force = 25 Newtons 
Angle Force makes with wrench is 60 degrees 
Torque = r x F x sin () 
Torque = 30cm x 25N x sin 60^{0}
sin 60^{0} =0.86 
T = 6.5 NM 
2.3 Instruments Used to Measure Torque 
Torque Wrench: A torque wrench is a precision tool commonly used to apply a specific amount of torque to fasteners such as nuts and bolts. It has a calibrated scale that allows engineers to set the desired torque value, ensuring accurate and consistent tightening 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Torque Wrench&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image45.png"/&gt;
   Picture 74
&lt;/figure&gt;
A torque wrench has a calibrated scale or a digital display that allows the user to set and control the applied torque accurately. 
Torque Sensors: 
Torque sensors are devices that measure the torque applied to an object or produced by a rotating system. These sensors can be integrated into machinery or used as standalone devices to provide real-time torque measurements. 
Dynamometers: 
A Prony brake is a friction brake and torque-measuring system that was invented by French mathematician and engineer Gaspard de Prony in 1821. The term "brake horsepower" is one measurement of power derived from this method of measuring torque. (Power is calculated by multiplying torque by rotational speed.) It's also known as an absorption dynamometer. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Prony Brake Dynamometer&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image46.png"/&gt;
   Picture 73
&lt;/figure&gt;
2.4 Types of Torque 
Torque can be either static or dynamic 
Static Torque is the force needed to initiate movement from a standstill or to stop an already moving object. It’s the amount of Torque required to overcome the inertia of a stationary object and start its rotation. This concept is commonly used in scenarios where an object needs to be moved from a rest position, such as starting a car engine or unscrewing a tightly fixed bolt. A person pushing a closed-door is applying a static torque because the door isn’t rotating despite the force applied. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Static Torque: Turning a bolt&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/torque-on-bolt.png"/&gt;
   Torque is related to bolt tightness, but many additional factors, such as friction, combined into a single nut factor, can have a significant impact on the relationship of torque to the tightness of the bolted joint.
&lt;/figure&gt;
Dynamic Torque refers to the twisting force that maintains an object’s constant rotational motion once it has started moving. This type of torque is used to accelerate or decelerate a moving object, such as a wheel or a motor. It’s the Torque necessary to keep an object spinning at a steady rate, overcoming any frictional forces acting against it. Dynamic Torque is often used in the context of continually operating systems, like turbines in a power plant or motors in electric appliances. 
Example Usage 
Dynamic Torque: Running a motor 
Dynamic Torque: Torque to maintain rotation 
The drive shaft in a racing car accelerating from the start line exhibits dynamic torque because it must be producing an angular acceleration of the wheels, given that the car is accelerating along the track. 
How can we increase or decrease torque? 
It is often necessary to increase or decrease the torque produced by a motor to suit different applications. Recall that the length of a &lt;em&gt;lever&lt;/em&gt; can increase or decrease the force on an object at the expense of the distance through which the lever must be pushed. Similarly, the torque produced by a motor can be increased or decreased through the use of gearing. An increase in torque comes with a proportional decrease in rotational speed. The meshing of two gear teeth can be viewed as equivalent to the interaction of a pair of levers as shown in &lt;xref ref="gear-ratio"/&gt;. 
Gear Ratio 
When a larger gear drives a smaller one, for one rotation of the larger gear the small gear must complete more revolutions - so the output will be faster than the input. If the situation is reversed, and a smaller gear drives a larger output gear, then for one rotation of the input the output will complete less than one revolution – so the output will be slower than the input. The ratio of the sizes of the two gears is proportional to the speed and torque changes between them.

            <Title>Voltage Regulator</Title>
            <Text>An automatic voltage regulator (AVR) is a control device which detects any fluctuation in a generator’s voltage and adjusts the excitation current to offset the fluctuation and so keep the output voltage constant regardless of load changes. 
A simplified block diagram of the components of the Hyundai HDEC2000 AVR used on the training ship is shown in &lt;xref ref ="avr_block_diagram"/&gt;.     The primary function is to provide continuous voltage regulation of the generator through excitation current control with a PID (proportional, integral, derivative) software control algorithm, but the device also includes function blocks which provide monitoring, alarm, and system protection.  Two-way communications are provided through a network interface or via the front panel.

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/sidebyside&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
The three main components of the AVR are the Digital Signal Processor, the Rectifier, and the Power Module. The device uses a combination of hardware and software to perform its functions.
The Digital Signal Processor (DSP) is a specialized microprocessor designed to process and manipulate digital signals in real time.  The DSP software is executable code stored in nonvolatile Flash memory.  The DSP executes code and controls hardware to enable the AVR to perform functions such as regulation, measurement, monitoring, protection, and communications.
The DSP accepts both digital and analog inputs, the most important being the generator voltage and current, which are measured using current and potential (voltage) transformers on the generator output, and digitized by an analog to digital converter (ADC) in the DSP.  Based on these values and the system requirements, the DSP calculates the amount of excitation current required and produces a command signal that is transmitted to the Power Module.
The Rectifier module supplies DC power to the power module.  The power source for the module may come from a Permanent Magnet Generator, as done on the training ship, or directly from the main generator terminals if the generator is self-excited.  The module uses a three-phase full-wave rectifier, &lt;xref ref="three_phase_rectifier"/&gt;, to convert the supply to a DC voltage. 
The Power Module uses pulse width modulation (PWM) to trigger a set of insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT) that supply the requested excitation current  An excitation current signal is transmitted back to the DSP to be used for to PID feedback, and for over-excitation limitation, protection functions and monitoring.  PWM and IGBTs are discussed in more detail in &lt;xref ref="what-is-pulse-width-modulation" text="title" /&gt; and &lt;xref ref="what-is-an-igbt" text="title"/&gt;.

            <Title>Anticipate and prepare for casualties</Title>
            <Text>Surprisingly often, casualties can be predicted.  An alert engineer will notice slight changes in the operating temperatures and pressures over time, which can indicate failing pumps or fouled heat exchangers.  Failing bearings run hotter and noisier, and can easily be detected by touch or with vibration analysis.  Failing electrical insulation has a distinctive smell. Sometimes, the signs are not apparent; you just have a vague feeling that something is not right.  In any event, you should not ignore your hunches, but think through what they might mean and plan for them. You should continuously prepare for casualties before they occur by mentally reviewing potential situations, their consequences, and planning your responses.

            <Title>Alternating current motors</Title>
            <Text>In concept and construction, a three-phase AC motor is very similar to a three-phase alternator, as shown in &lt;xref ref="fig_24_10_png"/&gt;. When three-phase AC current (the line current) is applied to the stator windings of the motor, with one phase connected to each winding, the current will produce a magnetic field around each winding that varies in magnitude and direction in a sinusoidal pattern. The magnetic field produced by each winding interacts with that of the adjoining windings to produce a net magnetic field that revolves around the stator. If a compass needle were placed in the center of the stator it would rotate at a speed coinciding with the frequency of the applied current, since the compass needle is a two-pole magnet. The direction of rotation of the field will depend on the order in which the windings are connected to receive the line current: if two of the three line connections are interchanged at the motor terminals, the direction in which the magnetic field produced by the stator windings will reverse, as will the compass needle.
The stator windings of the three-phase machine in &lt;xref ref="fig_24_10_png"/&gt; are spaced at 120-degree intervals, so that the field produced by these stator windings rotates once per cycle of the applied current, a speed n_scalled the &lt;term&gt;synchronous speed&lt;/term&gt;. This stator is said to have two poles, and the corresponding synchronous speed can be calculated from the following relation: &lt;me&gt;n_s = \frac{120 f}{P}&lt;/me&gt;

&lt;figure xml:id="fig_24_10_png"&gt;
 &lt;caption&gt;Three-phase alternator&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;image source="pics/electricity/24-10.png" width="75%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
where P is the number of poles on the stator and f is the line frequency. A two-pole stator supplied with 60 Hz line current would have a synchronous speed of 3600 rpm. In this example, the magnetic field produced by the stator and the compass needle would both rotate at this speed.
Additional windings can be fitted to the stator for each phase. Each additional winding per phase provides an additional pair of poles. For example, the stator could be arranged with nine windings, with every third winding connected to the same phase, so that there are three windings per phase. Since each set of windings provides one pair of poles this would be a 6-pole motor. The synchronous speed of a 6-pole motor, when supplied with 60 Hz line current, is 1200 rpm.

            <Text>If we replace the compass needle in the above example with a more powerful magnet, the magnetic field produced by this magnet would lock onto the rotating magnetic field produced by the stator windings. The rotor can be a strong permanent magnet or an electromagnet supplied (excited) by a DC source. This type of AC motor is called a &lt;term&gt;synchronous   motor&lt;/term&gt; and is characterized by the fact that the rotor rotates at the same speed as the magnetic field produced by the stator windings, the synchronous speed. Synchronous motors range in size from small motors for electric clocks fitted with permanent-magnet rotors, to very large propulsion motors, developing 70,000 HP or more, with electromagnetic rotors.

            <Title>Work</Title>
            <Text>Mechanical energy in transition is called &lt;em&gt;work.&lt;/em&gt; When an object is moved through a distance against a resisting force, we say that work has been done. The formula for calculating work is:  &lt;me&gt;W=Fd&lt;/me&gt;
Where: &lt;ul marker=""&gt; 
W = work (in foot-pounds)  
F = force (in pounds) 
d = distance moved in direction of applied force (in feet)  
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
As you can see from this formula, you need to know how much force is exerted and the distance through which the force acts before you can find how much work is done. The unit of force is the pound. When work is done against gravity, the force required to move an object is equal to the weight of the object. Why? Because weight is a measure of the force of gravity or, in other words, a measure of the force of attraction between an object and the earth. How much work will you do if you lift that 5-pound rock from the bottom of the 100-foot cliff to the top? You will do 500 foot-pounds of work-the weight of the object (5 pounds) times the distance (100 feet) that you move it against gravity. 
We also do work against forces other than the force of gravity. When you push an object across the deck, you are doing work against friction. In this case, the force you work against is not only the weight of the object; but also the force required to overcome friction and slide the object over the surface of the deck. 
Notice that mechanical potential energy, mechanical kinetic energy and work are all measured in the same unit, foot-pounds. One foot-pound of work is done when a force of 1 pound acts through a distance of 1 foot. One foot-pound of mechanical potential energy or mechanical kinetic energy is the amount of energy that is required to accomplish 1 foot-pound of work.

            <Text>Electrical systems may be described as either DC (direct current) or AC (alternating current) depending on the voltage supply.  
In DC systems, the power supply maintains a constant polarity, &lt;ie/&gt; one terminal is always positive, and the other is always negative, and the supply voltage is usually fairly steady.  Batteries and solar cells are examples of DC voltage sources.  In DC circuits, current always flows around the circuit in exactly one direction, from the positive to the negative terminal. &lt;xref ref="fig_battery"/&gt; is a simple example of a DC system. The current flows from the positive terminal of the battery, through the bulb, the switch, and then returns to the negative terminal of the battery.  
On the other hand, in AC systems the polarity of the voltage switches periodically in a repeating pattern.  This causes the current in the circuit to change periodically as well.  In this section we discuss some important properties of period waves</Text>

            <Title>Head</Title>
            <Text>You will also find another kind of pressure unit, which appears to be a length. These units include inches of water, inches of mercury (Hg), or the height of some other liquid of known density. These units, while measured in length units, still represent a pressure. The length describes the pressure exerted by a column of liquid of the given height, and is known as the &lt;em&gt;head&lt;/em&gt;. 
For example, a pressure reading of 1 inch of water (1 in. H₂O) means that the exerted pressure is equal to the pressure exerted by a column of water 1 inch high, or that a column of water in a U-tube would be displaced 1 inch by the pressure being measured. Similarly, a reading of 12 inches of mercury (12 in. Hg) means that the measured pressure is sufficient to support a column of mercury 12 inches high. 
What is really being expressed, even though it is not mentioned in the pressure unit, is the fact that a certain quantity of material (water, mercury, etc.) of known density will exert a certain definite force upon a specified area. Pressure is still force per unit area even if the pressure unit refers to the height of some liquid.</Text>

            <Text>The basic principle dealing with the transformation of energy is the &lt;em&gt;Principle of Conservation of Energy&lt;/em&gt;. This principle can be stated in several ways. Most commonly, perhaps, it is stated: &lt;q&gt;Energy can be neither destroyed nor created, but only transformed.&lt;/q&gt; Another way to state this principle is: &lt;q&gt;The total quantity of energy in the universe is always the same.&lt;/q&gt; Still another way of expressing this principle is by the equation  &lt;me&gt;\mathrm{Energy}_{in} = \mathrm{Energy}_{out}&lt;/me&gt;The &lt;q&gt;energy out&lt;/q&gt; may be quite different in form from the &lt;q&gt;energy in,&lt;/q&gt; but the total amount of energy input must always equal the total amount of energy output. 
Another principle, the &lt;em&gt;Principle of Conservation of Matter,&lt;/em&gt; states: &lt;q&gt;Matter can be neither created nor destroyed, but only transformed.&lt;/q&gt; As you probably know, the development of the atomic bomb demonstrated that matter can be converted into energy; other developments have demonstrated that energy can be converted into matter. Therefore, the Principle of the Conservation of Energy and the Principle of the Conservation of Matter are no longer considered as two parts of a single law or principle but are combined into one principle: “Matter and energy are interchangeable, and the total amount of energy and matter in the universe is constant." 
The interchangeability of matter and energy is mentioned here only to point out that the statement &lt;q&gt;energy in must equal energy out&lt;/q&gt; is not strictly true for certain situations. However, any noticeable conversion of matter into energy or energy into matter can occur only under very special conditions that we need not consider now. All the energy transformations that we will deal with can be understood quite simply if we consider only the Principle of the Conservation of Energy, that is, &lt;em&gt;Energy in must equal Energy out&lt;/em&gt;.

            <Title>Power Source</Title>
            <Text>The power source is the device that supplies electrical energy to the circuit. Common power sources include batteries, generators, and power supplies.  An ordinary wall outlet is a convenient connection to a distance power source.

            <Title>AC Circuits</Title>
            <Text>In AC circuits the power cannot be calculated as easily as DC power for two reasons.  First, the sinusoidal current and voltage are continuously changing, which means that the power is too.  Second, any reactive elements in the circuit shift the current out of phase with the voltage, as shown in &lt;xref ref="fig_phase_shift"/&gt;. 
The first issue is solved by using RMS average values for current, voltage and power, however simply applying &lt;xref ref="PEI"/&gt; and multiplying the RMS voltage by the RMS current does not give the correct RMS power because of the second issue, the phase shift between the current and voltage waveforms.
The correct formula for calculating power in a single-phase AC circuit is &lt;men xml:id="ACPEI"&gt; P = E I \cos\theta&lt;/men&gt; where:
&lt;md&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt;P \amp =  \text{Real electrical power (RMS, in watts)}&lt;/mrow&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt;I \amp =  \text{Current (RMS, in amperes)}&lt;/mrow&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt;V \amp = \text{Voltage (RMS, in volts)}&lt;/mrow&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt;\theta \amp = \text{phase angle between current and voltage}&lt;/mrow&gt;
&lt;/md&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The \cos\theta term is called the power factor.  Angle \theta is the amount of phase shift, and the power factor the power factor reduces the apparent power S = EI, to the true power value, sometimes called the real power. The power factor gives an indication of how reactive elements affect the system.  Note that since the power factor is the cosine of  angle \theta, its value is always between one and negative one.

The National Safety Council has found that hands are the body part most frequently injured on the job. Accidents to the hand fall into these categories: abrasions, cuts, punctures, crushes, contact with moving machinery, burns, and chemical injuries. Gloves and hand protection are available to protect you from nearly all of these hazards. However, glove selection must be based on performance characteristics of the gloves, conditions, durations of use, and hazards present. One type of glove will not work in all situations. 


In the engine room, particular hazards include high temperatures and moving machinery. Long sleeved shirts are advisable to protect your arms, and you should always have a pair of work gloves available to use when necessary to protect your hands when working around hot pipes. Special high temperature gloves should always be worn when changing burners, and the appropriate chemical resistant gloves should be worn when working with burner cleaning and boiler chemicals. You should also pay particular attention to avoid contact with moving parts of machinery or power tools with moving parts, and insure that safety guards are always in place. Gloves should always be inspected for damage before use.

            <Title>Electric propulsion</Title>
            <Text>Electric drives for ship propulsion have been used for over 100 years, employing generators driven by steam turbines, diesel engines, or gas turbines to power the &lt;term&gt;propulsion motor&lt;/term&gt;(s) on the propeller shaft(s). ln comparison to geared drive, electric drive is more expensive to install, heavier, and less efficient. Electric drive is therefore normally used only where these disadvantages are outweighed by the advantages, which include excellent control of propeller speed and direction, as well as the flexibility of locating the generators and their prime movers in different spaces than the propulsion motors. A further advantage is that the power output from any number of generators can be combined to drive one or more propulsion motors.
When ship's service power as well as propulsion power is derived from the same generators, the ship is said to have an &lt;term&gt;integrated&lt;/term&gt; power plant.

 &lt;xref ref="fig_24_22_png"/&gt; shows a modern electric-propulsion system using AC/AC variable-frequency drive. In this system the mechanical prime mover drives an AC generator at constant speed, enabling ship's services to be supplied at constant frequency. For full speed of the ship, the maximum rpm of the propeller can be achieved without the frequency converter, based on the ratio of numbers of poles: &lt;me&gt;\text{rpm}_{\text{motor}} = \text{rpm}_{\text{alternator}} \left(\frac{N_a}{N_m}\right)&lt;/me&gt;

&lt;figure xml:id="fig_24_22_png"&gt;
 &lt;caption&gt;Electric drive with multiple prime movers and frequency converter&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;image source="pics/electricity/24-22.png" width="85%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
where N_a and N_m are the numbers of poles in the alternator and propulsion motor respectively. As an example, if the prime mover is a gas turbine running at 3600 rpm, driving a two-pole alternator, and the propulsion motor is a 60-pole synchronous motor directly connected to the propeller shaft, the propeller will turn at 120 rpm. (If an induction motor is used, the propeller rpm will be slightly lower.) For maneuvering, lower propeller rpm is achieved without changing the generator speed by using the frequency converter to reduce the frequency of the power to the propulsion motor. Reversing of the propulsion motor is easily accomplished by switching two of the three leads supplying the motor.

            <Title>Field and excitation</Title>
            <Text>In most generators the magnet that provides the field is an electromagnet, comprised of a steel core wound with coils of wire that form the &lt;term&gt;field windings&lt;/term&gt;, as in &lt;xref ref="fig_24_12_png"/&gt;. The &lt;term&gt;field&lt;/term&gt; is energized by the &lt;term&gt;excitation   current&lt;/term&gt; that flows through these field windings. To maintain the polarity of the field, the excitation must be direct current. &lt;xref ref="fig_24_12_png"/&gt; shows how copper   &lt;term&gt;slip rings&lt;/term&gt; mounted on the rotor are used with stationary carbon   &lt;term&gt;brushes&lt;/term&gt; to provide the electrical connection from the excitation source to the field windings. The brushes are pressed against the slip rings by springs, and are replaced as they wear.
&lt;figure xml:id="fig_24_12_png"&gt;
 &lt;caption&gt;Rotating field for two-pole alternator, showing slip rings&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;image source="pics/electricity/24-12.png" width="75%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Most generators are &lt;term&gt;self-excited&lt;/term&gt;, meaning that the excitation current is derived from the power produced by the generator. Starting of a self-excited generator makes use of the residual permanent magnetism of the field core. Once the generator starts rotating, the residual permanent magnetism induces current to begin to excite the field coils, and the resulting magnetic flux builds up to the desired level.

            <Title>DC heater level too low or high</Title>
            <Text>The DC heater normally operates at near steady state, with water inflows and outflows in balance, and the level remaining relatively constant at the midpoint of the gage glass. If this balance is upset, something is wrong and the situation must be investigated and corrected.

If the problem is caught early, it is usually easy to correct as soon as the root cause is discovered.  However, if the situation is left to fester, it can lead to serious problems.  Low deaerator levels affect the feed pump suction, and can lead to low water in the boiler and loss of the plant.  Excessively high levels should be avoided to maintain proper deaeration and prevent tank rupture.

Water enters the DC heater primarily from the main condensate line, but also from the high pressure drain system. Steam enters from the auxiliary exhaust system to heat and deaerate the feed, and then condenses and adds to the tank contents. Feedwater is removed from the tank by the feed pump to supply the boiler.  In a perfectly closed system, these flows would be equal, and the level would remain steady.  In a real ship, however, leaks in the steam systems must be replenished by periodic addition of *make-up feed (MUF)*. Aboard the *Kennedy*, the taking on make-up feed is the responsibility of the Cadet Engineer of the Watch.  Most ships use an automated regulating valve to do the same job. 

The most common cause of incorrect DC heater level is inattention to duty by the watchstander -- failing to take on make-up when needed, or leaving the make-up valve open too long.  On automated ships, failure of the make-up feed regulator can cause similar problems. Inattention can also permit the distilled tank, which is the source of the make-up feed, to go dry. Water can also be lost into an idle condenser, if a condensate pump recirculation valve is left open.

The DC heater is equipped with an automated dump valve, which opens to drain excess feed to the reserve feed tanks.  If this valve fails or is bypassed, the DC heater level will fall precipitously. 

Failure of a main or auxiliary condensate pump will cause an immediate reduction in the inflow, leading to low level in the DC heater and a high level in the corresponding condenser. Failure of the main feed pump will cause the opposite problem -- high level in the DC heater and a low level in the boiler.</Text>

            <Title>Overspeed Device</Title>
            <Text>Because a diesel is not self-speed-limiting, a failure in the governor, injection system, or sudden loss of load could cause the diesel to overspeed. An overspeed condition is extremely dangerous because engine failure is usually catastrophic and can possibly cause the engine to fly apart. 
An overspeed device, usually some type of mechanical flyweight, will act to cut off fuel to the engine and alarm at a certain preset rpm. This is usually accomplished by isolating the governor from its oil supply, causing it to travel to the no-fuel position, or it can override the governor and directly trip the fuel rack to the no-fuel position.</Text>

For most safety matters on board ship, the U.S. Coast Guard and international maritime regulations (such as SOLAS) take precedence; however OSHA regulations are sensible guidance that should be followed whenever possible whether you are working at sea, at a shore job, or even at home.

            <Text>The &lt;em&gt;water drum&lt;/em&gt;, also known as the &lt;em&gt;mud drum&lt;/em&gt;, is another cylindrical vessel, usually smaller in diameter than the steam drum and located at the bottom of the boiler, which acts as a lower reservoir for water. The water drum also serves as a collection point for the sludge that normally forms in the boiler as chemicals precipitate out of the boiler water as it is evaporated. These solids can be removed by a &lt;em&gt;bottom blow&lt;/em&gt; which discharges them over the side.

            <Text>All substances are composed of molecules. The energy associated with molecules is called thermal energy. Thermal energy, like mechanical energy, exists in two stored forms and in one transitional form. The two stored forms of thermal energy are called internal potential energy, and internal kinetic energy. Thermal energy in transition is called &lt;em&gt;heat.&lt;/em&gt;Although molecules are too small to be seen, they behave in some ways pretty much like the larger objects we considered in the discussion of mechanical energy. Molecules have energy of position (internal potential energy) because of the forces which attract molecules to each other. In this way, they are somewhat like the rock and the earth we considered before. Molecules have energy of motion (internal kinetic energy) because they are constantly in motion. Thus, the two stored forms of thermal energy-internal potential energy and internal kinetic energy-are in some ways similar to mechanical potential energy and mechanical kinetic energy, except that everything is on a smaller scale.

            <Text>When you are the Engineering Officer of the Watch (EOW) you are in charge of the engine room and responsible for the proper operation of all machinery and the safety of all personnel in the engine room.  These are your primary duties, as STCW clearly states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Officers in charge of an engineering watch shall not be assigned or undertake any duties which would interfere with their supervisory duties in respect of the main propulsion system and ancillary equipment.  They shall keep the main propulsion plant and auxiliary systems under constant supervision until properly relieved, and shall periodically inspect the machinery in their charge.  They shall also ensure that adequate rounds of the machinery and steering-gear spacers are made for the purpose of observing and reporting equipment malfunctions or breakdowns, performing or direction routine adjustments, required upkeep and any other necessary tasks. 
&lt;attribution&gt;&lt;pubtitle&gt;STCW Code Section A-VIII/2 part 3-2 ¶ 69&lt;/pubtitle&gt;&lt;/attribution&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
As long as you are on watch, you are in charge and responsible.  Your responsibility only ends when you are properly relieved.  Even if the chief engineer is in the engineroom, you remain responsible for the watch unless he specifically informs you that he has taken charge.  
The authority of the Cadet Engineer of the watch aboard the Patriot State is more limited than that of the watch engineer, so as a cadet you should get permission of the watch officer before carrying out any operations described below.</Text>

            <Title>Types of Bourdon Tube Gauges</Title>
            <Text>Several types of Bourdon tube gauges are available for different applications.  Scales marked using various units are also available.
Simplex Gauge: This is a basic bourdon tube gauge, designed to measure positive pressures only.  The scale starts at atmospheric pressure on the left and rotates clockwise as the measured pressure increases.  A peg on the face prevents the pointer from moving below 0.  The gauge is a dual-scale model, with pressure indicated in both psig and kPa.
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Simplex Pressure Gauge&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="40%" source="images/simplex-gage.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Vacuum gauge: Vacuum gages are designed to measure pressures below atmospheric only.  The scale starts at zero on the right and rotates counterclockwise as the absolute pressure decreases and the vacuum increases. The maximum values on the gauge corresponds to the maximum possible vacuum that can be achieved relative to the atmospheric pressure, approximately 30 inches or 760 mm of mercury vacuum. Note that the gauge below has dual scales:  inches of mercury vacuum and mm mercury absolute.
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Vacuum Gauge&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="40%" source="images/vacuum-gage.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Compound Gauge:  These gauges can measure both positive and negative (vacuum) pressures, making them suitable for applications where both types of pressure need to be monitored. There is no distinct zero point on these gauges because it moves as the atmospheric pressure changes.  The pressure and vacuum scales are usually marked with different units.  On the gauge shown, positive pressures are in psi or bar, and vacuums are in inches mercury, and bars absolute.
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Compound Pressure Gauge&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="40%" source="images/compound-gage.jpg"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Differential  Gauge:  This gauge is designed to measure the pressure difference between points.  Internally, there are two bourdon tubes, and the linkage is arranged to move the pointer based on the difference between them.  These gauges are recognizable because they have two pressure connections, but only one pointer.  Differential gauges are often used to measure the pressure drop across filters or strainers.  An increasing pressure drop is an indication that the strainer needs to be cleaned or the filter changed.
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Differential Pressure Gauge&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="40%" source="images/differential-gage.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Duplex Gauge:  This type features two separate bourdon tubes and pointers within a single gauge housing, allowing simultaneous measurement of two different pressures.  Useful for displaying two different but related pressures simultaneously, for example the inlet and outlet pressures on a heat exchanger.

            <Title>Enthalpy</Title>
            <Text>When discussing a system involving work and heat, such as a boiler and turbine, you may hear the term &lt;em&gt;enthalpy.&lt;/em&gt; Enthalpy is a thermodynamic quantity defined as the sum of internal energy and the work done by the substance to move its surroundings out of the way as it moves or expands, known as &lt;q&gt;flow work.&lt;/q&gt; One consequence of this definition is that when heat flows into a substance at constant pressure, its enthalpy increases by the amount of heat energy added. This is why enthalpy is sometimes described as the &lt;q&gt;heat content&lt;/q&gt; of a substance. Remember that heat is energy in transition, and is never stored so no substance ever really &lt;q&gt;contains&lt;/q&gt; heat.

            <Title>Steam Pressure and Temperature</Title>
            <Text>Steam pressure and temperature are important parameters to watch while the boiler is operating. Obviously, the purpose of the boiler is to produce steam at the correct pressure and temperature to be used by the main engine and auxiliary machinery. Under normal conditions these values are maintained by the combustion control system and should be relatively steady. A rising or falling steam value is a sure indication of an impending problem. You should carefully observe the normal operating range for the drum and superheater outlet pressures, and notify the engineer or take corrective action if these values deviate from normal. 
High steam pressure, if left unchecked will lead to the superheater safety valves lifting. Properly designed and maintained safety valves are capable of relieving the entire boiler to prevent a boiler explosion, but they should never have to open on a properly operated boiler. Low steam pressure will cause a loss of power at the main engines and generators. Failure to respond will lead to electrical blackout of the ship and loss of propulsion power. Incorrect superheat temperature is less harmful than incorrect steam pressure, but you should still note it and correct it if possible. High and low superheat temperatures often indicates another problem with the boiler such as dirty burners, excess air, or incorrect feed temperatures. On ships with controlled superheat, the superheater temperature control system may be faulty.

            <Title>A Brief History</Title>
            <Text>
The way base units of length have been determined has changed greatly over time. Long ago, the base for reference was the human body. For example, the cubit was a unit that indicated the length from the elbow to the fingertips.
Length units based on the human body were used for thousands of years. The Roman mile (In Latin &lt;foreign&gt;mille passus &lt;/foreign&gt;, which means &lt;q&gt;thousand paces&lt;/q&gt;) consisted of a thousand paces (of 5 feet each) as measured by every other step—as in the total distance of the left foot hitting the ground 1,000 times, which equals approximately 5,000 ft. In 1592, English Parliament wanted to standardize the measurement of the mile and made the decision that it should be equal to eight furlongs. Furlongs, which are still used as a unit of measurement in horse racing, are 660 feet long. 660 times eight equals, you guessed it, 5,280 ft.
This continued until a major change took place around 200 years ago. As the Age of Discovery came to an end and industry grew primarily in Western Europe, it became necessary to unify units of length on a global scale. In the 17th century, discussions were held in Europe regarding the unification of units. After a century of discussions, France proposed the unit of the meter (meaning "to measure" in Greek) in 1791. The reference at this time was the distance of the meridian from the north pole to the equator. One meter was set as 1/10,000,000 of this distance. Today, one meter is defined as "the distance that light travels in a vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a second," as defined in 1983.
For navigation on water (marine), air, and space the nautical mile unit of length is used. Historically, a nautical mile was defined as the meridian arc length corresponding to one minute of a degree of latitude.  Nautical mile is based on Earth’s circumference being 360 degrees. These degrees can then be divided into 60 minutes. One of these minutes (or minutes of arc as they are called in navigation) along a great circle on Earth represents one nautical mile. Today the international nautical mile is defined as exactly 1,852 meters (6,076 ft; 1.151 mi).
In terms of statute or land miles, a nautical mile represents 1.15 miles. This is because one degree of latitude is approximately 69 statute miles in length. 1/60th of that measure would be 1.15 statute miles.

            <Title>Engine Lubrication System</Title>
            <Text>An internal combustion engine would not run for even a few minutes if the moving parts were allowed to make metal-to-metal contact. The heat generated due to the tremendous amounts of friction would melt the metals, leading to the destruction of the engine. To prevent this, all moving parts ride on a thin film of oil that is pumped between all the moving parts of the engine. Once between the moving parts, the oil serves two purposes. One purpose is to lubricate the bearing surfaces. The other purpose is to cool the bearings by absorbing the friction generated heat. The flow of oil to the moving parts is accomplished by the engine's internal lubricating system. Oil is accumulated and stored in the engine's oil pan where one or more oil pumps take a suction and pump the oil through one or more oil filters as shown in Figure 12. The filters clean the oil and remove any metal that the oil has picked up due to wear. The cleaned oil then flows up into the engine's oil galleries. A pressure relief valve(s) maintains oil pressure in the galleries and returns oil to the oil pan upon high pressure. The oil galleries distribute the oil to all the bearing surfaces in the engine. Once the oil has cooled and lubricated the bearing surfaces, it flows out of the bearing and gravity-flows back into the oil pan. In medium to large diesel engines, the oil is also cooled before being distributed into the block. This is accomplished by either an internal or external oil cooler. The lubrication system also supplies oil to the engine's governor, which is discussed later in this module.

            <Title>Pressure</Title>
            <Text>Pressure is the measure of a perpendicular force exerted per unit area on the boundaries of a substance (or system). It is caused by the collisions of the molecules of the substance with the boundaries of the system. As molecules hit the walls, they exert forces that try to push the walls outward. The forces resulting from all of these collisions cause the pressure exerted by a system on its surroundings. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Pressure acting on a body&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/pressure-on-body.png"/&gt;
   Picture 1730183778
&lt;/figure&gt;
Pressure is directly proportional to force and inversely proportional to the area over which the force is applied. Increasing the force applied to a surface or decreasing the area increases the pressure. 
Mathematically, pressure is expressed as: 
Pressure = \frac{Force}{Area}
6.7.2 PRESSURE SCALES 
Pressure scales are systems used to measure and quantify pressure. There are several types of pressure scales, including: Atmospheric Pressure, Absolute Pressure, Gauge Pressure, Vacuum Pressure. 
Atmospheric Pressure 
Air, which is all around you, has weight, and it presses against everything it touches. This pressure is called atmospheric pressure, or air pressure. Atmospheric pressure is the force exerted on a surface by the air above it as gravity pulls it to Earth. Atmospheric pressure is the pressure exerted by the Earth's atmosphere at a given location. Elevation affects atmospheric pressure. For example, standard atmospheric pressure at sea level is approximately 14.7 psia or 101.325 kPa. In Denver, Colorado, atmospheric pressure is 12.4 psia or about 84.0 kPa, and in Death Valley, California it is 14.9 psia or 102.6 kPa. Atmospheric pressure is commonly measured with a barometer. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Atmospheric Pressure&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image4.png"/&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
1 atmosphere equals: 
in US customary units:14.7 psia at Sea Level 
in International System of Units (SI) System:101.325 kPa at Sea Level 
in gauge pressure, 0 gauge = One Atmosphere at Sea Level = 14.7 psia = 101.325 kPa 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Gauge Pressure&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image5.png"/&gt;
   Picture 93
&lt;/figure&gt;
Vacuum Pressure 
Pressure below atmospheric pressure is designated as a vacuum. A Vacuum gauge is used to measure vacuum pressure and is measured in inches mercury gauge (inHg). A perfect vacuum corresponds to absolute zero pressure. 
0 gauge = One Atmosphere at Sea Level = 14.7 psia = 101.325 kPa 
29.92 inHg gauge = 760 Torr = 0 inches Hg Absolute Scale 
Partial Vacuum gauge pressure measurements require conversions which will be discussed in the following sections.

6.7.3 UNITS FOR MEASURING PRESSURE AND CONVERSIONS 
There are numerous units of measurement for pressure: 
US Standard Pressure, pounds per square inch (psi) 
International (SI) or Metric, pascal or kilo-pascal, Newtons per Meter Squared (kPa) 
Atmospheric Pressure (atm) 
Absolute Pressure (psia) 
Gauge Pressure (psig) 
Head Pressure (feet) 
Torr (torr) 
Bar (Bar) 
Gauge Vacuum (inHg) 
Compound Gauge (psig and inHg) 
Dual Gauge (Multiple Units) 
Guage for Inches of water (in H20) 
Units 
There are two basic systems utilized today for measurement, the US Standard and the SI, or International System. The unit of measurement used depends upon what System(s) are involved, and therefore Conversion factors are used to go between systems. We have seen this in the chapter sections on length, area, volume, and time. In terms of measuring pressure, the US System uses psi or pounds per square inch. The International System uses newtons per centimeter squared, or kilopascals (kPa). 
US Standard System (psi) 
In the US standard system, pressure is commonly measured using pounds per square inch (psi) in which the force units are pounds (lbs.) and the area units are square inches &lt;em&gt;(&lt;/em&gt;
   {in.}^{2}). 
The psi unit represents the amount of force (in pounds) exerted on a one-square-inch area. For instance, a pressure of 30 psi means that a force of 30 pounds is distributed over each square inch of the surface. 
Pressure = \frac{Force}{Area} =\frac{Pounds}{InchesSquared} =\frac{lbs.}{{in.}^{2}} = psi 
Pressure =\frac{Force}{Area} =\frac{Force = ma}{Area} F = ma (mass x acceleration) = \frac{mx{32.2fts}^{2}}{Area}
International System of Units (SI)/Metric (kPa) 
In the metric system, pressure is typically measured using kilopascals (kPa), which represent newtons per square meter (N/m²). One pascal is equal to one newton of force distributed over a one-square-meter area. However, this is a relatively small pressure, so in practical applications, kilopascals (kPa) or megapascals (MPa) are commonly used. 
One newton is the force needed to accelerate one kilogram of mass at the rate of one meter per second squared. So, we can say one newton is one kgm/s². 
Force Units are measured in pascals or kilopascals (newtons). 
Area Units are measured in centimeters or meters squared. 
In the SI system, pressure is described in pascals (Pa). Since Pressure = Force/Area, the equation for measuring pressure in pascals is: 
Pressure (pascals) = \frac{Force}{Area} =\frac{Newtons}{MetersSquared} =\frac{N}{m^{2}} = \frac{kg}{mxs^{2}}
Pressure = \frac{Force}{Area}
   \frac{Newtons}{Meterssquared}= \frac{F = ma}{MetersSquared} = \frac{kgxM/s^{2}}{MetersSquared}=\frac{Forceduetogravity = 9.8m/s^{2}}{Area}
Atmospheric Pressure (psia) 
Atmospheric pressure, as stated earlier, is specific to elevation. Air, which is all around you, has weight, and it presses against everything it touches. That pressure is called atmospheric pressure, or air pressure. It is the force exerted on a surface by the air above it as gravity pulls it to Earth. Atmospheric pressure is the pressure exerted by the Earth's atmosphere at a given location. For example, standard atmospheric pressure at sea level is 760mmHg, 14.7 psia or 101.325 kPa. In Denver, Colorado, atmospheric pressure 12.4 psi or about 84.0 kPa, and in Death Valley, California it is 14.9 psi or 102.6 kPa. 
Atmospheric pressure is commonly measured with a barometer. 
One Atmosphere at Sea Level = 14.7 psi, 101.325 kPa and 760 mmHg (1 Torr). 
Absolute Pressure (psia) 
Absolute pressure is the numerical scale that starts at zero, where zero corresponds to the vacuum of space. Absolute value is elevation dependent, meaning absolute pressure increases the closer one gets to Earth, and continues to increase the further one travels towards Earth’s center. For example, absolute pressure at sea level is 14.7 psia. In Death Valley, which is below sea level, absolute pressure is 14.9 psia. The densities of different liquids will also affect absolute pressure, so the deeper an object is placed in fluid, the more pressure it will experience. Absolute pressure is always greater than the corresponding gauge pressure. 
For shipboard purposes if you are utilizing a gauge, you can simply add 14.7 psi to the gauge reading in psi to get the absolute pressure. For example, a gauge pressure of 100 psig would be the same as an absolute pressure of 114.7 psia. 
Gauge pressure (psig) 
Since the absolute atmospheric pressure is always present, and acts on everything equally, we normally don’ even notice it. Pressures are usually measured up or down from atmospheric pressure, and an ordinary pressure gauge reads zero when it is subjected to atmospheric pressure only. Pressures measured in this way are called gauge pressure. It is important to distinguish between gauge pressure and the absolute pressure described in the next section. 
Gauge pressures start at zero and increase with positive values with the range dependent on what system application is being measured. 
Vacuum Gages also start at zero and increase with negative values with the greatest value of vacuum being 29.92 inHg. 
We sometimes say psig to indicate gauge pressure and other times we merely say psi. By common convention, gauge pressure is always assumed when pressure is given in pounds per square inch, pounds per square foot, or similar units. The “g” (for gauge) is added only when there is some possibility of confusion. Absolute pressure, on the other hand, is always expressed as pounds per square inch absolute (psia), and so forth. It is always necessary to establish clearly just what kind of pressure we are talking about, unless this is very clear from the nature of the discussion.

Head Pressure 
Head pressure pertains to the pressure exerted by a fluid due to the weight of the fluid a vertical distance above a certain reference point. 
It is commonly measured in meters (m) or feet (ft). Essentially, head pressure represents the potential energy that a fluid possesses, which can be converted into work or kinetic energy. 
A vertical column of water 2.31 feet high exerts one pound of force over one square inch. 
When measuring head pressure, the specific gravity of a fluid must be included. Specific gravity is a measure of the density of a substance in comparison to the density of water. 
The Specific Gravity of fresh water equals 1. 
Pressure/Head Conversion Formula 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;The weight of one cubic foot of fresh water is of 62.427 pounds.&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image7.png"/&gt;

   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image6.jpeg"/&gt;
   Picture 4
&lt;/figure&gt;
A column of water one foot high distributed over one square inch = .433 psi 
What this relationship is saying is that for every foot we go up in height, we add 0.433 pounds per square inch at the base of an object. Or we multiply the height of the water by 0.433. Keep in mind that we are talking about water here and specifically the density and weight of water. Other liquids will have their own density, and therefore the psi at the bottom of a column of another liquid would be different than that of water. 
Example problems: 
A column of water 10 ft high exerts what pressure?

   Picture 456013673
&lt;/figure&gt;
For columns of water less than one foot, we multiply the height in inches by .036 psi. 
There are 12 inches in 1 foot, therefore \frac{.433psiperfoot}{12inchesperfoot} = .036 psi 
One Inch of Water = .036 psi.

Instruments Used to Measure Pressure 
Pressure can be measured directly by measurement of the applied force. 
Before mechanical manometers and electronic diaphragm pressure sensors were invented, pressure was measured by liquid manometers with mercury or water. 
Mercury (abbreviated Hg) heavier liquid metal 
Fresh Water (abbreviated H20) 
Mercury 
Mercury is a useful material to use in a manometer because of its high density. This means that a much shorter column is needed compared to water. 
Mercury is commonly used in barometers because its high density means the height of the column can be a reasonable size to measure atmospheric pressure. A barometer using water, for instance, would need to be 13.6 times taller than a mercury barometer to obtain the same pressure difference. This is because mercury is 13.6 times denser than water. 
1 inch of mercury = .491 psi 
1 pound of mercury = 2.036 inches 
1 inch of mercury = 13.6 inches of water 
1 inch of water =.0736 inches of mercury 
A manometer is a simple instrument used to measure pressure differences in a fluid. It typically involves a column of liquid, and the pressure difference causes a change in the liquid's height, which can be measured to determine the pressure, dependent upon the liquid’s density. 
A U-tube manometer is probably the most common manometer in use today. These devices typically use a column of liquid to indicate the pressure difference between two points. Pressure is read on a scale as the difference in height (h) between the two liquid columns. The units of measure commonly used are inches of water and inches of mercury. 
Measuring pressure 
In a U-tube manometer the tube is filled until both sides are approximately half full. When the pressures are equal, the column of liquid on each side will be at the same height. This is usually marked as zero on a scale. 
With both sides of the manometer open to the atmosphere, the fluid level on one side will be the same as the level on the other side because P1 equals P2. 
U-tube manometer 
Now suppose one end of the U-tube manometer is connected to an unknown pressure P1 whose value must be determined. The other end is left exposed to the atmospheric pressure, P2. 
The difference in the height of the liquid on the two sides of the tube is the differential pressure. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;U-tube manometer utilizing water&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image11.png"/&gt;
   Measuring differential pressure.
&lt;/figure&gt;
The total difference in liquid height is 4 units, which means that our pressure differential is 4 inches of water column. 
Figure 1. With both ends of the tube open, the liquid is at the same height in each leg. 
Figure 2. When positive pressure is applied to one leg, the liquid is forced down in that leg and up in the other. The difference in height, “h,” which is the sum of the readings above and below zero, indicates pressure. 
Figure 3. When a vacuum is applied to one leg, the liquid rises in that leg and falls in the other. The difference in height, “h,” which is the sum of the readings above and below zero, indicates the amount of the vacuum.

&lt;/figure&gt;
Types of fluids 
As we said earlier, a manometer is filled with a liquid. Typical manometer liquids are mercury, water, and light oils. 
It’s worth saying here that mercury was a common manometer fluid in the past, but has largely been replaced due to its environmental and health hazards. 
Quite often the liquid is colored to help detect the fluid movement. Here, the specific gravity of the manometer fluids must be included to convert Head to pressure. 
Pressure =\frac{HeadXS.G}{2.31}

TORR 
1 atmosphere of pressure at sea level is equal to 760 torr. The torr is named after the Italian physicist Evangelista Torricelli (&lt;em&gt;1608 – 1647&lt;/em&gt;), who invented the mercury barometer. When Torricelli first used mercury to measure atmospheric pressure, he found that the pressure supported a column of mercury about 760 millimeters high and 1 torr being 1 mm in height of Hg. 760 mmHg is equivalent to 29.92 inches. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Mercury Barometer&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image14.png"/&gt;
   Picture 97
&lt;/figure&gt;
1 atm = 14.7 psia, 101.325 kPa 
1atm =760 mmHg 
760 torr = 101.325 kPa 
760 torr = 14.7 psia 
29.92 in hg =14.7psi 
Example Problem 
Meteorologists state that a “falling” barometer indicates an approaching storm. Given a barometric pressure of 27.5 in. Hg, express the pressure in each of the following units of pressure: 
a. Atmospheres 
b. mmHg 
c. kPa 
d. psi 
Solution 
For each conversion, we apply a unit conversion factor related to units of standard pressure. 
(a) To express the pressure in atmospheres, we derive a unit factor related to the equivalent relationship, 29.9 inHg = 1 atm. 
27.5 inHg X \frac{1atm}{29.92inHg} = 0.9 atm 
(b) To convert to millimeters of mercury, we derive a unit factor related to the equivalent relationship, 29.9 inHg = 760 mmHg. 
27.5 inHg x \frac{760mmHg}{29.92inHg}= 699 mmHg 
(c) To find the pressure in kilopascals, we derive a unit factor related to the equivalent relationship 
29.9 inHg = 101.325 kPa. 
27.5 inHg X \frac{101.325kPa}{29.92inHg} = 93kPa 
To calculate the pressure in pounds per square inch, we derive a unit factor related to the equivalent relationship, 29.9 inHg = 14.7 psi. 
27.5 inHg x \frac{14.7psia}{29.92inHg} = 13.5 psi 
BAR 
The bar is defined using the SI derived unit, pascal: 1 bar= =100,000 Pa (100 kPa). =100,000 N/m2. 
1 bar is slightly less than the current average atmospheric pressure on Earth at sea level being 14.5 psia. The bar and the millibar were introduced by the Norwegian meteorologist Vilhelm Bjerknes, who was a founder of the modern practice of weather forecasting. 
One Atmosphere =\frac{USSystem}{MetricSystem} = \frac{14.7psia}{101.325kPa} = .145 
1 Bar = 100 kPa 
100 kPa X .145 = 14.5 psia 
1 Bar =14.5 psia 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;bar Gauge&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image15.png"/&gt;
   Picture 88
&lt;/figure&gt;
1 Bar = 100,000 Pa 
1 Bar = 14.5 psia 
1 Bar = 750 torr 
1 Bar= 0.98 atm 
To convert 5 bars to psi, you use the conversion factor: 
1 bar = 14.5 psi 
So, for 5 bars: 
5 bars×14.5psi/bar = 73 psi 
To convert 5 bars to kilopascals (kPa), you can use the conversion factor: 
1 bar = 100 kPa 
So, for 5 bars: 
5 bars ×100 kPa/bar = 500kPa 
Gauge Vacuum (inHg) 
Bourdon Tube Vacuum Gauges are used to measure pressures less than atmospheric pressure with the Vacuum Gauge range from 0 to 30 inches Hg. Atmospheric pressure at Sea Level is 14.7 psia or 101.325 kPa, which corresponds to 0 gauge. When in use and the vacuum increasing, the needle will move towards larger numbers with 29.92 inHg being the greatest achievable vacuum at Sea Level, as per Torricelli’s experiment. 
Vacuum pressure gauges and Pressure gauges, both start at zero-gauge pressure with zero-gauge pressure corresponding to atmospheric pressure. When the vacuum pressure gauge decreases below atmospheric, the vacuum gauge needle will begin to move off zero and move towards 29.92 in Hg gauge, stopping at the reduced pressure being measured. The value of 29.92 inches of mercury (inHg) gauge corresponds to the maximum possible vacuum that can be achieved relative to the atmospheric pressure. 
0 Gauge Pressure = Atmospheric Pressure, 14.7 psia in US Customary Units or 101.325 kPa in SI Units. 
Almost all Vacuum Gauge readings will be somewhere between 0 and 29.92 inHg 
In working with Inches Mercury Gauge readings, it is essential to convert those readings into psia (absolute) values. The converted readings can be used when consulting Steam Tables for additional properties related those readings.

&lt;/table&gt;
Let’s say the Vacuum Gauge indicates 10 inHg. 
This indicates the pressure is &lt;em&gt;less than&lt;/em&gt; atmospheric pressure and mercury is the measuring element. This reading, in Inches Mercury (inHg), must be converted to PSIA to utilize Steam Tables that are established on PSIA. 
Knowing One Inch of Mercury exerts .491 psi Hg 
10 inHg gauge can be multiplied by .491 psi Hg equaling 4.91 psi 
Knowing 14.7 psia is Atmospheric Pressure and that inHg vacuum gauges indicate less than atmospheric: 
Vacuum Gauge Reading Equivalent psia = 14.7 psia – (10 inHg x .491 psi Hg) 
= 14.7 psia – (4.91 psi) 
= 9.79 psia 
Compound Gauge

6.74 Pressure Gauge Construction 
A pressure gauge is a common instrument used to measure pressure in a wide range of applications. 
Bourdon Tube 
A bourdon pressure gauge is the most common type of pressure gauge and it uses a curved tube that straightens under pressure and shows the reading on a dial. The Bourdon gauge consists of a tube bent into a coil or an arc. As the pressure in the tube increases, the coil unwinds. A pointer connected to the end of the tube can be attached to a lever and a pointer calibrated to indicate pressure. 
&lt;figure&gt;

Pressure Transducer 
A pressure transducer is an electronic device that converts pressure into an electrical signal. It is often used in automated systems or where electronic data acquisition is required. 
&lt;figure&gt;

   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image17.png"/&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
Pressure is defined as force per unit area. Can pressure be increased in a fluid by pushing directly on the fluid? Yes, but it is much easier if the fluid is enclosed. The heart, for example, increases blood pressure by pushing directly on the blood in an enclosed system (valves closed in a chamber). If you try to push on a fluid in an open system, such as a river, the fluid flows away. An enclosed fluid cannot flow away, and so pressure is more easily increased by an applied force. 
What happens to a pressure in an enclosed fluid? Since atoms in a fluid are free to move about, they transmit the pressure to all parts of the fluid and to the walls of the container. Remarkably, the pressure is transmitted &lt;em&gt;undiminished&lt;/em&gt;. This phenomenon is called Pascal’s principle, because it was first clearly stated by the French philosopher and scientist Blaise Pascal (1623–1662): A change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to all portions of the fluid and to the walls of its container. 
PASCAL’S PRINCIPLE 
A change in pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to all portions of the fluid and to the walls of its container. 
Pascal’s principle, an experimentally verified fact, is what makes pressure so important in fluids. Since a change in pressure is transmitted undiminished in an enclosed fluid, we often know more about pressure than other physical quantities in fluids. Moreover, Pascal’s principle implies that &lt;em&gt;the total pressure in a fluid is the sum of the pressures from different sources&lt;/em&gt;. We shall find this fact—that pressures add—very useful. 
Blaise Pascal had an interesting life in that he was home-schooled by his father who removed all of the mathematics textbooks from his house and forbade him to study mathematics until the age of 15. This, of course, raised the boy’s curiosity, and by the age of 12, he started to teach himself geometry. Despite this early deprivation, Pascal went on to make major contributions in the mathematical fields of probability theory, number theory, and geometry. He is also well known for being the inventor of the first mechanical digital calculator, in addition to his contributions in the field of fluid statics. 
Application of Pascal’s Principle 
One of the most important technological applications of Pascal’s principle is found in a &lt;em&gt;hydraulic system&lt;/em&gt;, which is an enclosed fluid system used to exert forces. The most common hydraulic systems are those that operate car brakes. Let us first consider the simple hydraulic system shown in &lt;xref ref="one-cubic-inch"/&gt;
&lt;figure xml:id="one-cubic-inch"&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;1 cubic inch&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image9.jpeg"/&gt;
   A small force can be converted into a larger force when pressure is transmitted through liquids in different containers with pistons that are connected.

A typical hydraulic system with two fluid-filled cylinders, capped with pistons and connected by a tube called a hydraulic line. A downward force F1F1 on the left piston creates a pressure that is transmitted undiminished to all parts of the enclosed fluid. This results in an upward force F2F2 on the right piston that is larger than F1F1 because the right piston has a larger area.

            <Title>Unit Conversions</Title>
            <Text>Frequently, engineers need to find length equivalents between different systems of measurement. For example, in the construction of a ship there may be different contractors, some of whom use US standard measurement and others who use metric. Since the agreed upon system is metric, conversions are required to standardize all measurements.
Conversion of units is the process to convert between different units of measurement for the same quantity, typically through multiplicative conversion factors which change the measured quantity value without changing its effects. Unit conversion is often easier within the metric or the SI than in others, due to the regular 10-base in all units and the prefixes that increase or decrease by 3 powers of 10 at a time.
The unit-factor method or the unity bracket method is a widely used technique for unit conversions using the rules of algebra. 
The factor-label method is the sequential application of conversion factors expressed as fractions and arranged so that any dimensional unit appearing in both the numerator and denominator of any of the fractions can be cancelled out until only the desired set of dimensional units is obtained. For example, 10 miles per hour (mi/hr or mph) can be converted to meters per second (m/s) by using a sequence of conversion factors as shown below:</Text>

            <Title>Pressure Conversions</Title>
            <Text>In interpreting pressure measurements, a great deal of confusion arises because the zero point on most pressure gages represents atmospheric pressure rather than zero absolute pressure, and both pressure and head scales are used. Thus it is important to specify the kind of pressure being measured under given conditions. To clarify the numerous meanings of the word pressure, the relationship among gage pressure, atmospheric pressure, vacuum, and absolute pressure is illustrated in &lt;xref ref="PressureRelations"/&gt;. 
&lt;figure xml:id="PressureRelations"&gt; &lt;caption&gt;Pressure Relationship&lt;/caption&gt; &lt;image source="images/pressure_relationships" width="75%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
If you can remember the following facts, it is relatively easy to perform unit conversions between the various pressure scales.
Atmospheric pressure equivalents: &lt;ul marker=""&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;md&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt; \text{Atmospheric Pressure} \amp= 14.7 \text{ psi} &lt;/mrow&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt; \amp = 29.92 \textrm{ in Hg} &lt;/mrow&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt; \amp = 760 \textrm{ mm Hg} &lt;/mrow&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt; \amp = 34 \textrm{ ft H}_2\textrm{O} &lt;/mrow&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt; \amp= 101.3 \textrm{ kPa} &lt;/mrow&gt;
&lt;mrow&gt; \amp= 1.01 \textrm{ bar}&lt;/mrow&gt;&lt;/md&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
Absolute scales measure up from zero 
Gage scales measure up or down from atmospheric pressure 
Vacuum scales measure down from atmospheric pressure

Electrical charge is a fundamental property of matter that gives rise to the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces in nature. It is the property that describes the interaction between particles due to their electric fields. Electric charge is responsible for phenomena such as electricity, magnetism, and the behavior of charged particles.

&lt;/remix&gt;
&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/sidebyside&gt;
There are two types of electric charge:
Positive Charge: Particles with a positive charge have a deficiency of electrons compared to the number of protons in their atomic nuclei. Protons carry a positive charge, and when there is an excess of protons, an object is positively charged.
Negative Charge: Particles with a negative charge have an excess of electrons compared to the number of protons in their atomic nuclei. Electrons carry a negative charge, and when there is an excess of electrons, an object is negatively charged.
Similar charges repel each other and dissimilar charges attract.
&lt;definition&gt;&lt;statement&gt;
The coulomb (unit symbol: C) is the unit of quantity of electric charge, and is equal to the charge of approximately 6.3\times10^18 electrons.
&lt;/statement&gt;&lt;/definition&gt;
Objects can have a net positive, negative, or neutral charge, depending on the balance of protons and electrons they possess.

            <Text>The control of a diesel engine is accomplished through several components: the camshaft, the fuel injector pump, fuel injector and the governor. The camshaft provides the timing needed to properly inject the fuel, the fuel injector pump provides the components that meters and injects the fuel, and the governor regulates the amount of fuel that the injector is to inject. Together, these three major components ensure that the engine runs at the desired speed.</Text>

            <Title>Vacuum</Title>
            <Text>A pressure below atmospheric pressure is called a vacuum. The farther below the atmospheric pressure, the greater the vacuum. Vacuum can not be made greater and greater without limit, however. At some point, the absolute pressure drops as low as possible and a perfect vacuum is achieved. A perfect vacuum is the lowest possible pressure, or the absence of all pressure. When we speak of a &lt;q&gt;high&lt;/q&gt; vacuum, we are talking about a low absolute pressure. 
When measuring a vacuum, there are three possible methods. When vacuum is measured starting with zero at perfect vacuum and increasing as pressure rises, then the greater the value, the smaller the vacuum. This is known as the absolute pressure scale. We can also measure pressure on a scale starting at zero at atmospheric pressure, and indicating negative values when the pressure is below atmospheric (vacuum) and positive values when the pressure is above atmospheric. This is the behavior of a standard pressure gage. And finally, we can measure vacuum on a scale starting with zero at atmospheric pressure and increasing as the vacuum increases. Most vacuum gages operate this way. On this scale no vacuum would be indicated by 0 psig, and a perfect vacuum would be indicated by approximately 14.7 psi vacuum. 
The most common scale used on vacuum gages aboard ship display vacuum in inches of mercury, with the vacuum gage scale marked from 0 to 30 inches of mercury. When this gage reads zero, the pressure in the space is the same as atmospheric pressure or, in other words, there is no vacuum. A vacuum gage reading of 29.92 inches of mercury would indicate a perfect (or nearly perfect) vacuum. In actual practice, it is impossible to obtain a perfect vacuum even under laboratory conditions.

            <Text>In general, a valve is a device installed in a piping system to control the amount, direction or pressure of the contained fluid flowing through the pipe lines. Most valves control fluid flow with a carefully designed moving part which can fully open, partially open (called &lt;em&gt;throttling&lt;/em&gt;), or close an opening called an &lt;em&gt;orifice&lt;/em&gt; inside the valve. Since the valve must stop all fluid flow when it is closed, the surface of the moving part that covers the opening and the surface surrounding the stationary opening must be precisely machined and fitted. In many valves, both these surfaces are metal and they must seal tightly against one another without the aid of gaskets or seals between them. 
Various valves use one of four basic means of controlling flow:  &lt;ul&gt;
a moving disk or plug blocking orifice; 
sliding a flat, cylindrical or spherical surface across an orifice; 
rotating a disk across the diameter of piping; 
or, moving a flexible material into the flow path. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The movable part inside the valve has its position controlled by a shaft or valve stem that passes through the valve body to the outside. The valve stem is rotated or moved axially depending on the valve design by one or a combination of the following methods:  &lt;ul&gt;
Manually using a hand-wheel or lever 
Electrically using electro-magnets (solenoids) or motors 
Pneumatically using compressed air to move a piston or air motor 
Hydraulically using pressurized oil to move a piston or hydraulic motor 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 
Several different types of valves are shown in &lt;xref ref="valvetypes_png"/&gt;. Of these, the most important types for shipboard use - globe, gate, check, plug, ball, butterfly, and relief - will be discussed in this chapter.

            <Text>A confined space is defined by OSHA as a space that has limited or restricted means of entry, is not designed for continuous occupancy, and is large enough and configured so that a person can enter the space and maneuver well enough to perform tasks.  
Confined spaces pose several hazards that can endanger workers who enter  them due to their limited entry and exit points, restricted airflow, and potential for hazardous atmospheres. 
On ships, some examples of confined spaces include:  Cargo and fuel tanks, cofferdams, pressure vessels, sewage tanks, and void spaces.

            <Title>Single-phase generator</Title>
            <Text>The diagram below shows a simplified AC, single-phase synchronous generator, illustrating the rotor, stator, armature and field. 
A prime mover such as an engine or turbine spins the rotor and supplies the input mechanical energy.  The rotor carries an externally energized electromagnet (the field) which creates a magnetic field.  The rotor is surrounded by the stator, which carries multiple turns of copper windings, (the stationary armature).   The ends of the armature windings are the generator terminals; the external circuit begins and ends there.
&lt;figure xml:id="fig_simple_ac_generator"&gt;

&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

As the rotating magnetic field passes by the stationary armature, a voltage is induced in the armature.  This voltage varies in magnitude and direction sinusoidally, as shown in &lt;xref ref="fig_sine-wave-definitions"/&gt;.
The frequency is related to the rotor rpm according to this relation: &lt;me&gt;f =   \frac{120 \times N}{2 \times 60}&lt;/me&gt; where f is the frequency in Hz and N is the total number of poles.   
For a two-pole field (one north and one south pole) rotating at 3600 rpm, the voltage will alternate through 60 cycles each second &lt;ie/&gt; 360 Hz. With a four-pole field, the north and south poles will pass by the armature windings twice per rotation. As a result, a four-pole generator will produce the same frequency as a two-pole generator while spinning at half the speed.  
Although the voltage continuously varies from instant to instant, we represent the sine wave voltage using its RMS average.The RMS voltage is proportional to the speed of rotation and also the strength of the magnetic field, therefore the generator output voltage can be adjusted by controlling the current that creates the field. </Text>

            <Title>Types of Head Protection</Title>
            <Text>
There are several types of hard hats available, each designed for specific purposes and levels of protection. 
Class G (General) hard hats and caps are intended for general service and they provide protection against impact hazards and a limited protection against electrical shock (up to 2,200 V). They are used in industries such as construction, manufacturing, mining, and shipbuilding. This is the most suitable hard hat for shipboard use. 
Class E (Electrical) hard hats are utility service hats which are designed to protect the wearer’s head from impact and penetration by falling or flying objects and from high-voltage shock (up to 20,000 V). They are used extensively by electrical workers. 
Class C (Conductive) hard hats or caps, are designed to be light and comfortable while protecting against impact hazards, but they do not provide any protection against contact with electrical conductors. Class C hats often have a front brim to protect the face from sun, reduce glare, and help shed rain. They are used on occasions where there is a possibility of falling objects or bumping the head, but no risk of electrical shock. 
Bump caps are less obtrusive than hard hats and are designed to provide comfortable, lightweight but they have limited protection against minor head bumps, knocks, and scrapes.  They in environments where there is a risk of hitting the head on objects such as low ceilings, beams, or equipment. They are not meant a substitute for a hard hat because they do not afford protection from high electrical shock, high impact forces, or penetration by falling objects, and they are not OSHA approved, so they can not be used in situations where a hard hat is required.

The density of the atoms in copper wire is such that the valence orbits of the individual atoms overlap, causing the electrons to move easily from one atom to the next. Free electrons can drift from one orbit to another in a random direction. When a potential difference is applied, the direction of their movement is controlled. The strength of the potential difference applied at each end of the wire determines how many electrons change from a random motion to a more directional path through the wire. The movement or flow of these electrons is called electron current flow or just current. 
To produce current, the electrons must be moved by a potential difference. The symbol for current is (I). The basic measurement for current is the ampere (A). One ampere of current is defined as the movement of one coulomb of charge past any given point of a conductor during one second of time. 
If a copper wire is placed between two charged objects that have a potential difference, all of the negatively-charged free electrons will feel a force pushing them from the negative charge to the positive charge. This force opposite to the conventional direction of the electrostatic lines of force is shown in Figure 9. 
Electron current, or amperage, is described as the movement of free electrons through a conductor. In electrical formulas, current is symbolized with a capital I, while in the laboratory or on schematic diagrams, it is common to use a capital A to indicate amps or amperage (amps).

Head injuries are caused by falling or flying objects, or by bumping your head against a fixed object. Head protection, in the form of protective hats, must do two things – resist penetration and absorb the shock of the blow. This is accomplished by making the shell of the hat of a material hard enough to resist the blow, and by utilizing a shock-absorbing lining composed of headband and crown straps to keep the shell away from the wearer’s skull. Protective hats are also used to protect against electric shock.

            <Text>A diesel engine converts the energy stored in the fuel's chemical bonds into mechanical energy by burning fuel in a continuous, cyclic process, called the Diesel Cycle.  The word cycle refers an operation or series of events that repeats itself continuously.   

&lt;sidebyside widths="70% 25%" margins="0%" valign="middle"&gt;
&lt;stack&gt;
The main events in the diesel cycle are &lt;ul&gt;
Intake &lt;mdash/&gt; Fresh combustion air enters the cylinder.
Compression &lt;mdash/&gt; the combustion air is compressed to high temperature and pressure. 
Fuel Injection &lt;mdash/&gt; fuel is injected and ignites due the heat of compression. 
Power &lt;mdash/&gt; the rapidly expanding combustion gases are converted to work.
Exhaust &lt;mdash/&gt; the combustion products are expelled from the cylinder.
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
During the cycle, ignition occurs when fuel is injected into the air charge heated by compression to a temperature greater than the ignition point of the fuel.  The chemical reaction of burning the fuel liberates heat which causes the gases to expand and force the piston down, creating torque to rotate the crankshaft and drive the load. 
&lt;/stack&gt;
        &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;caption&gt;Four-stroke Cycle&lt;/caption&gt;

            &lt;/slate&gt;
          &lt;/interactive&gt;
        &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/sidebyside&gt;
All diesel engines fall into one of two categories, two-stroke or four-stroke engines. In the case of a four-stroke cycle engine, the engine requires four strokes of the piston (down, up, down, up) to complete one full cycle. Therefore, it requires two rotations of the crankshaft, or 720° of crankshaft rotation to complete one cycle.  In a two-stroke cycle engine all the cycle's events occur in just one rotation of the crankshaft, or 360°.

&lt;/figure&gt;
A check valve is a modified globe valve that allows fluid flow in one direction only,   through a pipe line and automatically stops flow in the opposite direction. A check   valve has two basic parts: the body which is similar to the body of a globe   valve – with one seat, two external pipe connections, and an opening for the bonnet to   attach to; and the Cover or Cap which replaces the globe valve bonnet   assembly and fastens to the body using the same methods used to attach bonnets on globe   valves. However, the cap is a blank cover with no hand operators, stuffing box or valve   stem. 
There are three main variations of check valves: swing checks, lift checks, and stop checks, and they are discussed below.

The direction of electron flow, shown in Figure 10, is from the negative (-) side of the battery, through the wire, and back to the positive (+) side of the battery. The direction of electron flow is from a point of negative potential to a point of positive potential. The solid arrow shown in Figure 10 indicates the direction of electron flow. As electrons vacate their atoms during electron current flow, positively charged atoms (holes) result. The flow of electrons in one direction causes a flow of positive charges. The direction of the positive charges is in the opposite direction of the electron flow. This flow of positive charges is known as conventional current and is shown in Figure 10 as a dashed arrow. All of the electrical effects of electron flow from negative to positive, or from a higher potential to a lower potential, are the same as those that would be created by a flow of positive charges in the opposite direction. Therefore, it is important to realize that both conventions are in use and that they are essentially equivalent; that is, all effects predicted are the same. In this text, we will be using electron flow in our discussions.

            <Text>At this point in the simplified cycle, you will find a feed pump to return the condensate back to the boiler. In an actual cycle you will find a number of additional items which are installed to increase the efficiency of the steam cycle by adding essentially &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; energy to the working fluid.
The first new item is the condensate pump, which is a centrifugal pump that takes suction on the condenser hot well and raises the condensate pressure enough to move it on to the DC heater. The condensate pump must pump from a vacuum, which is a difficult job for a pump. It is important to properly vent and seal the pump, or it will not pump well.

            <Title>Cylinder Sleeve or Bore</Title>
            <Text>Diesel engines use one of two types of cylinders. In one type, each cylinder is simply machined or bored into the block casting, making the block and cylinders an integral part. In the second type, a machined steel sleeve is pressed into the block casting to form the cylinder. Figure 2 and Figure 3 provide examples of sleeved diesel engines. With either method, the cylinder sleeve or bore provides the engine with the cylindrical structure needed to confine the combustion gasses and to act as a guide for the engine's pistons.

Four Stroke Cylinder Liner Two Stroke Cylinder Liner/air ports 
In engines using sleeves, there are two types of sleeves, wet and dry. A dry sleeve is surrounded by the metal of the block and does not come in direct contact with the engine's coolant (water). A wet sleeve comes in direct contact with the engine's coolant. The volume enclosed by the sleeve or bore is called the combustion chamber and is the space where the fuel is burned. In either type of cylinder, sleeved or bored, the diameter of the cylinder is called the bore of the engine and is stated in inches. For example, the bore of a 350 cubic inch Chevrolet gasoline engine is 4 inches. Most diesel engines are multi-cylinder engines and typically have their cylinders arranged in one of two ways, an in-line or a "V", although other combinations exits. In an in-line engine, as the name indicates, all the cylinders are in a row. In a "V" type engine the cylinders are arranged in two rows of cylinders set at an angle to each other that align to a common crankshaft. Each group of cylinders making up one side of the "V" is referred to as a bank of cylinders.</Text>

The term "brake horsepower" is one measurement of power derived from this method of measuring torque. (Power is calculated by multiplying torque by rotational speed.) It is also known as an absorption dynamometer.

            <Title>Time</Title>
            <Text>Time is a fundamental and abstract concept that is used to order events, quantify the duration between events, and describe the progression of phenomena. It is one of the basic dimensions in the physical universe, along with length and mass. Time is considered a scalar quantity and is often measured in seconds. 
Below are several key concepts relating to time: 
Temporal Order refers to the sequence or chronological arrangement of events or actions as they occur in time. It’s the concept that events happen in a specific order, one after another, according to the flow of time. Understanding temporal order is crucial in various fields such as storytelling, history, science, and everyday life, as it helps us make sense of cause-and-effect relationships and how events unfold over time. 
Relativity refers to the theory, proposed by Albert Einstein, wherein time is considered relative and can be experienced differently by observers moving at different speeds or in different gravitational fields. Time is often considered the fourth dimension in the context of spacetime, a concept that combines the three dimensions of space with the dimension of time. 
In the fields of Physics and Mathematics time plays a crucial role in physics equations and mathematical models, describing the behavior of physical systems over time. 
The Conservation of Energy is a fundamental principle of physics stating that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant over time. This means that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; it can only be transformed from one form to another (such as from kinetic energy to potential energy) or transferred between objects. Despite these changes, the total amount of energy within the system remains unchanged. This principle helps us understand and predict the behavior of physical systems over time, ensuring that energy calculations in any given situation will always balance out. 
Circadian rhythm is the internal biological clock that regulates various physiological processes in living organisms, including sleep-wake cycles, hormone secretion, body temperature, and metabolism. These rhythms follow a roughly 24-hour cycle and are influenced by external cues like light and temperature. 
In humans, the circadian rhythm is primarily controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the brain, which receives input from the eyes about light and darkness, helping to synchronize the internal clock with the external environment. 
Disruptions to circadian rhythms, such as jet lag or shift work, can have significant effects on health and well-being, impacting sleep quality, mood, cognitive function, and overall physiological health. That's why maintaining a regular sleep schedule and exposure to natural light during the day are essential for keeping circadian rhythms in sync. 
6.3.2 Units of Time 
The standard units of time in the International System of Units (SI) are: 
Second (s): The second is the base unit of time in the SI system. It is defined as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of radiation corresponding to the transition between two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium-133 atom. 
Minute (min): One minute is equal to 60 seconds. 
Hour (h): One hour is equal to 60 minutes or 3,600 seconds. 
Day (d): One day is defined as 24 hours, or 86,400 seconds. It is based on the Earth's rotation period. 
Week: A week consists of seven days. 
Month: Months are somewhat arbitrary units of time that vary in length. The most common definitions are the calendar months, which have 28, 30, or 31 days. 
Year (yr): A year is the time it takes for Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun. It is approximately 365.25 days. There are different types of years, such as the tropical year (based on the Earth's position relative to the Sun) and the sidereal year (based on the Earth's position relative to distant stars). 
Decade: A decade is a period of ten years. 
Century: A century is a period of one hundred years. 
Millennium: A millennium is a period of one thousand years. 
These units provide a way to express and measure various durations, from tiny fractions of a second to vast spans of time. Different fields and contexts may use specific units that are more relevant to their requirements; for example, astronomy may use units like light-years or parsecs to describe astronomical distances or cosmic timescales. 
Metric time and Decimal time are two standards of measuring time. The decimal time uses decimal points to distinguish the units while the &lt;em&gt;metric system&lt;/em&gt; does not. Some examples are: 
&lt;table&gt;
   &lt;title/&gt;
   &lt;tabular&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
         &lt;cell halign="left"&gt;Metric time&lt;/cell&gt;
         &lt;cell halign="left"&gt;Decimal time&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
         &lt;cell halign="left"&gt;30 minutes&lt;/cell&gt;
         &lt;cell halign="left"&gt;0.5 hours&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row&gt;
         &lt;cell halign="left"&gt;45 minutes&lt;/cell&gt;
         &lt;cell halign="left"&gt;0.75 hours&lt;/cell&gt;
      &lt;/row&gt;
   &lt;/tabular&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
Metric vs Decimal Time 
For units smaller than seconds, a prefix is used such as &lt;em&gt;milli&lt;/em&gt;second. 
Many calendars even today use the sun, moon, and natural unit to keep time. As civilization and technology advanced, standard units and clocks made it easier for everyone to be able to identify and measure time. Time is now measured based on the vibrations of the cesium-133 atom.

Military Time 
Military time is a standardized timekeeping system used by the military, emergency services, and other organizations around the world. Rather than using a 12-hour standard clock with AM and PM designations, military time uses a &lt;em&gt;24-hour clock&lt;/em&gt; system. 
In military time, each hour of the day is represented by a unique four-digit number. The first two digits represent the hour, and the second two digits represent the minutes. Therefore, 1600 military time is the way of expressing 4:00 PM in military format. 
This system is commonly used in military, aviation, emergency services, and other contexts where clarity and precision in timekeeping are critical. It eliminates confusion over AM and PM and simplifies calculations involving time intervals. 
A watch system, watch schedule, or watch bill is a method of assigning regular periods of work duty aboard ships and some other areas of employment. A watch system allows the ship's crew to effectively operate the ship 24 hours a day for the duration of long voyages or operations. 
Here's how military time corresponds to the traditional 12-hour clock:

History of Time Measurement Units 
Time and its measurement study is called horology. Measuring of time started more than thirty thousand years ago. But back then, societies did not have clocks. Time was measured by the patterns of the moon, shadows of the sun, and the placement of the stars in the sky. These astronomical objects were widely used to determine time. 
Measuring time with celestial bodies has been a fundamental practice throughout human history. Early civilizations used the movements of celestial bodies like the Sun, Moon, and stars to track time, create calendars, and organize their daily activities. 
Solar time refers to the most basic form of time measurement, which is based on the apparent motion of the Sun across the sky. Ancient sundials, for example, relied on the position of the Sun's shadow to indicate the time of day. 
Sundials - A sundial is a special structure created to determine the time of the day based on the shadow formed from the sun falling on it. 
A lunar calendar is a calendar system based on the phases of the Moon. Unlike solar calendars, which are based on the Earth's orbit around the Sun, lunar calendars measure time by the Moon's cycles, typically from one new moon to the next. Each lunar month lasts about 29.5 days, resulting in a year of about 354 days, which is shorter than the 365 or 366 days in a solar year. Because of this difference, lunar calendars often require adjustments, such as the addition of an extra month, to stay in sync with the solar year. Lunar calendars are used in various cultures and religions for determining holidays, festivals, and other important dates. 
Stars have also been important for timekeeping. The regular motion of certain stars across the night sky allowed navigators to determine their position and time of day, aiding in maritime navigation and long-distance travel. 
Today, while we primarily rely on precise atomic clocks for accurate timekeeping, celestial bodies still play a role in time measurement, especially in fields like astronomy and navigation. For instance, astronomers use observations of distant celestial objects to coordinate universal time standards and to calibrate our atomic clocks. 
The measurement of time has deep historical roots and is linked to the natural rhythms of the celestial bodies, especially the sun and the moon. 
Humankind’s need to gauge the divisions of the day and night led the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans to create sundials, water clocks, and other early chronometric tools. Western Europeans adopted these technologies, but by the 13th century, demand for a dependable timekeeping instrument led medieval artisans to invent the mechanical clock. Although this new device satisfied the requirements of monastic and urban communities, it was too inaccurate and unreliable for scientific application until the pendulum was employed to govern its operation. The precision timekeepers that were subsequently developed resolved the critical problem of finding a ship's position at sea and went on to play key roles in the Industrial Revolution and the advance of Western civilization.

6.3.3 Instruments to Measure Time 
Solar Day and Sundials: One of the earliest methods of measuring time is based on the solar day—the time it takes for the Earth to complete one rotation on its axis relative to the sun. Ancient cultures, such as the Egyptians and Babylonians, observed the motion of the sun's shadow to create sundials. These sundials divided the day into various parts based on the position of the sun.

&lt;/figure&gt;
Timekeeping Devices: Instruments like clocks and watches are used to measure and quantify time intervals. These devices are based on various mechanisms, such as pendulums, gears, or electronic oscillators. 
Today highly accurate timekeeping instruments set the beat for most of our electronic devices. Nearly all computers, for example, contain a quartz-crystal clock to regulate their operation. Moreover, not only do time signals beamed down from Global Positioning System satellites calibrate the functions of precision navigation equipment, but they do so as well for cellular telephones, instant stock-trading systems, and nationwide power-distribution grids. So integral have these time-based technologies become to our day-to-day lives that we recognize our dependency on them only when they fail to work. 
Clocks, both analog and digital, are widely used to measure time. Analog clocks typically have hands that move around a circular dial, indicating hours, minutes, and sometimes seconds. Digital clocks display time using numerical digits. 
Watches are portable timekeeping devices that individuals can wear on their wrists. They come in various styles, including analog, digital, and smartwatches, which offer additional functionalities beyond timekeeping. 
&lt;figure&gt;

Atomic Clocks use the vibrations of atoms (usually cesium or rubidium) to measure time with extraordinary precision. These clocks form the basis for International Atomic Time (TAI) and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). 
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
A stopwatch is a handheld timekeeping device used to measure elapsed time. It typically has buttons to start, stop, and reset the timing. 
Pendulum Clocks use the swinging motion of a pendulum to regulate the passage of time. These clocks were commonly used in the past for accurate timekeeping. 
Quartz Clocks use the vibrations of a quartz crystal to regulate time. They are commonly found in both analog and digital formats. 
Smartphones and Computers often include built-in clocks. These devices can synchronize with atomic clocks and provide accurate timekeeping. 
Nautical-Specific Time Measurements: Navigators and sailors have relied on specific time measurements to ensure safe and accurate maritime journeys. Two notable nautical-specific time measurements are: 
Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) is the mean solar time at the Prime Meridian, located at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England. Historically, GMT served as the standard reference time for navigation and was essential for calculating longitude accurately. 
Nautical Time: In the past, sailors aboard ships used nautical time to simplify timekeeping during their journeys. The day was divided into six four-hour watches, each indicated by the number of bells struck on the ship's bell. This system allowed for continuous operation and ensured crew members knew when to be on duty. 
The choice of timekeeping instrument depends on factors such as accuracy requirements, portability, and intended use. Atomic clocks, based on the vibrations of atoms, are among the most accurate timekeeping devices developed to date. 
CONCLUSION 
The history of time measurement is a fascinating subject, from the ancient sundials to the modern atomic clocks. Today, the most accurate time measurement is based on the behavior of atoms. The definition of a second as the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium-133 atom is now the universally accepted standard. It is amazing to think that the behavior of an atom can be used to measure time with such incredible accuracy.

            <Title>Exhaust and Intake</Title>
            <Text>At 82° ATDC, with the piston near the end of its power stroke, the exhaust cam begins to lift the exhaust valves follower. The valve lash is taken up, and 9° later (91° ATDC), the rocker arm forces the exhaust valve off its seat. The exhaust gases start to escape into the exhaust manifold. Cylinder pressure starts to decrease. 
After the piston travels three-quarters of its (down) stroke, or 132° ATDC of crankshaft rotation, the piston starts to uncover the inlet ports. As the exhaust valve is still open, the uncovering of the inlet ports at 43° ABDC, the camshaft starts to close the exhaust valve. 
At 53° ABDC (117° BTDC), the camshaft has rotated sufficiently to allow the spring pressure to close the exhaust valve. Also, as the piston travels past 48°ABDC (5° after the exhaust valve starts closing), the intake ports are closed off by the piston. The compressed fresh air enter the cylinder and helps cool the cylinder and scavenge the cylinder of the remaining exhaust gases. Commonly, intake and exhaust occur over approximately 96° of crankshaft rotation.

            <Title>Low Lube Oil Pressure</Title>
            <Text>Low oil pressure or loss of oil pressure can destroy an engine in short order. Therefore, most medium to larger engines will stop upon low or loss of oil pressure. Loss of oil pressure can result in the engine seizing due to lack of lubrication. Engines with mechanical-hydraulic governors will also stop due to the lack of oil to the governor. 
The oil pressure sensor usually stops the engine. The oil pressure sensors on larger engines usually have two low pressure setpoints. One setpoint provides early warning of abnormal oil pressure, an alarm function only. The second setpoint can be set to shutdown the engine before permanent damage is done.

            <Text>Your responsibilities when you take over a watch are clearly delineated by &lt;pubtitle&gt;STCW Section A-VIII/2&lt;/pubtitle&gt;, which states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Prior to taking over the engineering watch, relieving officers shall satisfy themselves regarding at least the following: &lt;ol&gt;
The standing orders and special instructions of the chief engineer officer relating to the operation of the ship's systems and machinery;
the nature of all work being performed on machinery and systems, the personnel involved and potential hazards;
the level and, where applicable, the condition of water or residues in bilges, ballast tanks, slop tanks, reserve tanks, fresh water tanks, sewage tanks and any special requirements for use or disposal of the contents thereof;
the condition and level of fuel in the reserve tanks, settling tank, day tank and other fuel storage facilities;
any special requirements relating to sanitary system disposals;
condition and mode of operation of the various main and auxiliary systems, including the electrical power distribution system;
where applicable, the condition of monitoring and control console equipment, and which equipment is being operated manually;
where applicable, the condition and mode of operation of automatic boiler controls such as flame safeguard control systems, limit control systems, combustion control systems, fuel-supply control systems and other equipment related to the operation of steam boilers;
any potentially adverse conditions resulting from bad weather, ice, contaminated or shallow water;
any special modes of operation dictated by equipment failure or adverse ship conditions;
the reports of engine-room ratings relating to their assigned duties;
the availability of fire-fighting appliances; and
the state of completion of engine-room log.
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
These items can be ascertained by inspecting the logbook and night orders, consulting with the off-going engineer and the bridge, and most importantly: completing a thorough inspection round of the engine room. You should make a complete inspection of all operating machinery before you take over the watch, and make quick rounds hourly throughout the watch.  
You are also required to insure that all members of your watch appear to be fully capable of performing their duties effectively.  This means no hangovers!</Text>

            <Text>The basic common-rail system consists of a high-pressure pump which discharges very high-pressure fuel into a common rail, or header, to which each fuel injector is connected by tubing. A spring-loaded bypass valve on the header maintains a constant pressure in the system, returning all excess fuel to the fuel supply tank. The fuel injectors are operated mechanically, and or electrically by the engine computer which controls the amount of diesel fuel oil injected into the cylinder at each power stroke by the lift of the needle valve in the injector. The principal parts of a basic common-rail system are shown in figure below.

&lt;/sidebyside&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Disposable foam plugs Foam plugs are inexpensive devices made of a formable material designed to expand to fit to the shape of each person’s ear canal. To use, roll the expandable plugs into a thin, crease-free cylinder, and insert it into the ear canal. Apply a slight pressure to the plug until the foam completely expands. These plugs can be reused a couple of times, but never reuse them if they have become dirty. Some people may find that the standard expandable plug is too large for their ear canal, and may find that the smaller plug model fits better. 
Reusable, pre-molded plugs Pre-molded plugs are made from silicone, plastic or rubber and are manufactured as either as a custom fit,  or are available in several standard sizes. Be sure to choose the proper size for your ear canals. In some cases, different size plugs may be required for each ear. The advantage of pre-molded plugs are that they are inexpensive, reusable, washable, convenient to carry, and come in a variety of sizes. Nearly everyone can find a plug that will be comfortable and effective. Another advantage is that in a dirty environment like the engine room, you don’t need to handle or roll the tips. You insert this type of plug by reaching over your head with one hand to pull up on your ear. Then use your other hand to insert the plug with a gentle rocking motion until you have sealed the ear canal. 
Hearing Bands Hearing Bands, also called canal caps or semi-insert devices often resemble earplugs on a flexible plastic or metal band. The earplug tips of a canal cap may be a formable or pre-molded material. Some have headbands that can be worn over the head, behind the neck or under the chin. The main advantage of canal caps is their convenience They are easy to put on and take off . When it’s quiet, employees can leave the band hanging around their necks, but they can quickly insert the plug tips when hazardous noise starts again. These devices are ideal for intermittent use, but they provide less protection than either plugs or muffs. Some people find the pressure from the bands uncomfortable. 
Over-the-Ear Earmuffs These are designed to cover the entire ear and provide a physical barrier to block out noise. They are often adjustable for a better fit.
&lt;assemblage xml:id="what_is_a_decibel"&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;What is a Decibel?&lt;/title&gt;
The Decibel (dB) is a logarithmic unit used to describe a ratio. The ratio may be power, or voltage or intensity or several other things. To get a taste for logarithmic units, first let’s look at some numbers: Suppose we have two loudspeakers, the first playing a sound with power P_1, and another playing a louder version of the same sound with power P_2, but everything else (how far away, frequency) is kept the same. The difference in decibels between the two is given by &lt;me&gt;10 \log (P_2/P_1) \text{ dB}&lt;/me&gt; where the log is to base 10. 
If the second produces twice as much power than the first, the difference in dB is &lt;me&gt; 10 \log (P_2/P_1) = 10 \log 2 = 3 \text{ dB}&lt;/me&gt;. If the second had 10 times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be &lt;me&gt;10 \log (P_2/P_1) = 10 \log 10 = 10 \text{ dB}&lt;/me&gt;B. If the second had a million times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be &lt;me&gt; 10 \log (P_2/P_1) = 10 \log 1,000,000 = 60 \text{ dB} &lt;/me&gt;. This example shows one feature of decibel scales that is useful in discussing sound: they can describe very big ratios in power with numbers of modest size. 
Sound is usually measured with microphones and they respond (approximately) proportionally to the sound pressure, p. The power in a sound wave is approximately equal to the square of the pressure. Since the log of the square of x is just  2 \log x , this introduces a factor of 2 when we convert to decibels for pressures. Therefore the difference in sound pressure level between two sounds with p_1 and p_2 is defined as: &lt;me&gt; 20 \log (p_2/ p_1) \text{ dB}&lt;/me&gt; where the log is to base 10. 
This formula involves a ratio of pressures, so to measure the sound level for a single sound, a reference level must be chosen. For sound intensity, the reference level (for air) is usually chosen as 20 micropascals, or 0.02 mPa. This is very low: it is 2 ten billionths of an atmosphere. Nevertheless, this is about the limit of sensitivity of the human ear, in its most sensitive range of frequency. Usually this sensitivity is only found in rather young people or in people who have not been exposed to loud music or other loud noises. Personal music systems with in-ear speakers are capable of very high sound levels in the ear, and are responsible for much of the hearing loss in young adults in developed countries. So if you read of a sound intensity level of 86 dB, it means that 20 \log (p_2/p_1) = 86  dB where p_1 is the sound pressure of the reference level, and p_2 that of the sound in question. Divide both sides by 20: \log (p_2/p_1) = 4.3  dB. 4 is the log of 10 thousand, 0.3 is the log of 2, so this sound has a sound pressure 20 thousand times greater than that of the reference level. 86 dB is a loud but not dangerous level of sound, if it is not maintained for very long. 
What does 0 dB mean? This level occurs when the measured intensity is equal to the reference level. i.e., it is the sound level corresponding to 0.02 mPa. In this case we have sound level &lt;me&gt; = 20 \log (p / p_{ref}) = 20 \log 1 = 0 \text{ dB}&lt;/me&gt;. So 0 dB does not mean no sound, it means a sound level where the sound pressure is equal to that of the reference level. This is a small pressure, but not zero. It is also possible to have negative sound levels: - 20 dB would mean a sound with pressure 10 times smaller than the reference pressure, i.e. 2 micropascals. 
&lt;/assemblage&gt;

            <Title>Fuel Injection</Title>
            <Text>Fuel in a liquid state is injected into the cylinder at a precise time and rate to ensure that the combustion pressure is forced on the piston neither too early nor too late, as shown in Figure 18. The fuel enters the cylinder where the heated compressed air is present; however, it will only burn when it is in a vaporized state (attained through the addition of heat to cause vaporization) and intimately mixed with a supply of oxygen. The first minute droplets of fuel enter the combustion chamber and are quickly vaporized. The vaporization of the fuel causes the air surrounding the fuel to cool and it requires time for the air to reheat sufficiently to ignite the vaporized fuel. But once ignition has started, the additional heat from combustion helps to further vaporize the new fuel entering the chamber, as long as oxygen is present. Fuel injection starts at 28° BTDC and ends at 3° ATDC; therefore, fuel is injected for a duration of 31°.

            <Title>By Delivery Characteristics</Title>
            <Text>All shaft driven pumps will deliver liquids at different volume rates if they are run at different speeds. Most pump designs require a change in speed to change their capacity (constant delivery). However, some rotary type pumps, and some radial or axial piston pumps are designed to vary the quantity of liquid delivered while maintaining the prime mover at a single speed. Pumps with these characteristics are known as  variable delivery pumps. 
Variable delivery pumps are most commonly found in hydraulic systems, where the delivery rate can be adjusted to control the rate of motion of hydraulic cylinders and actuators. </Text>

            <Title>Absolute Pressure (psia)</Title>
            <Text>Absolute pressure is the numerical scale that starts at zero, where zero corresponds to the vacuum of space. Absolute value is elevation dependent, meaning absolute pressure increases the closer one gets to Earth, and continues to increase the further one travels towards Earth’s center. For example, absolute pressure at sea level is 14.7 psia. In Death Valley, which is below sea level, absolute pressure is 14.9 psia. The densities of different liquids will also affect absolute pressure, so the deeper an object is placed in fluid, the more pressure it will experience. Absolute pressure is always greater than the corresponding gauge pressure. 
For shipboard purposes if you are utilizing a gauge, you can simply add 14.7 psi to the gauge reading in psi to get the absolute pressure. For example, a gauge pressure of 100 psig would be the same as an absolute pressure of 114.7 psia.</Text>

            <Title>Loss of control air pressure</Title>
            <Text>Loss of control air pressure is a serious situation with wide ranging effects. 80-95 psi *control air* is used to actuate almost all of the automatic regulating valves and reducing stations aboard the *Kennedy*. The feedwater regulator, feed pump governor,  reducing stations, the auxiliary exhaust make up and dump system, automatic make-up feed and many console actuated isolation valves all require control air to function.  Without control air, these devices and others must be bypassed or switched to local manual and controlled by hand in order to operate the plant.

Your first indication of a control air casualty will be the sounding of the low control air pressure alarm, which occurs at about 60 psi.  You will also observe low and dropping pressure on the control air system pressure gage on the main console.  

Leslie pneumatic control valves and regulators require 30 psi supply air to operate, so they will continue to function for a few minutes after the alarm sounds, until the pressure in the control air receiver drops below 30 psi.  At that point, the regulators will start to lose control and will move towards their *fail-safe* position.    The position, either fully open or closed, that automatic regulating valves take when the  air supply fails is selected by the designer to do the least harm or to facilitate hand control.   So, for example, the feedwater regulator will fail open and the feed pump will speed up to insure a feed supply to the boiler. The fireman is expected to manually control the drum level by adjusting the feed check valve.  Many regulating valves fail open, and can be manually closed by screwing down on their handwheel.

Aboard the training ship, the most likely cause of loss of control air pressure is that someone has accidentally switched off the compressor.  Mechanical or electrical compressor failure is also a possibility, as is a major air leak in the system.</Text>

   &lt;caption&gt;Conversion of Pressure to Rotating force&lt;/caption&gt;
  &lt;image source="images/diesel-image2.png" width="50%"/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
A diesel engine converts the energy stored in the fuel's chemical bonds into mechanical energy by burning the fuel. The chemical reaction of burning the fuel liberates heat and causes the gasses to expand and force he piston down, creating torque which rotates the crankshaft and drives the load. 
All diesel engines fall into one of two categories, two-stroke or four-stroke cycle engines. The word cycle refers to any operation or series of events that repeats itself. 
In the case of a four-stroke cycle engine, the engine requires four strokes of the piston (down, up, down, up) to complete one full cycle. Therefore, it requires two rotations of the crankshaft, or 720° of crankshaft rotation to complete one cycle. The events occurring during the four strokes are : &lt;ul&gt;
   Intake The piston passes TDC, the intake valve(s) open and the fresh air is admitted into the cylinder, the exhaust valve is still open for a few degrees to allow scavenging to occur. 
   Compression After the piston passes BDC the intake valve closes and the piston travels up to TDC (completion of the first crankshaft rotation). 
   Fuel injection As the piston nears TDC on the compression stroke, the fuel is injected by the injectors and the fuel starts to burn, further heating the gasses in the cylinder. 
   Power The piston passes TDC and the expanding gasses force the piston down, rotating the crankshaft. 
   Exhaust As the piston passes BDC the exhaust valves open and the exhaust gasses start to flow out of the cylinder. This continues as the piston travels up to TDC, pumping the spent gasses out of the cylinder. At TDC the second crankshaft rotation is complete. 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
In a two-stroke cycle engine all the cycle's events (intake, compression, power, and exhaust) occur in just one rotation of the crankshaft, or 360°. The events occur as follows: &lt;ul&gt;
   Intake The piston is near BDC and exhaust is in progress. The intake valve or ports open and the fresh air is forced in. The exhaust valves or ports are closed and intake continues. 
   Compression After both the exhaust and intake valves or ports are closed, the piston travels up towards TDC. The fresh air is heated by the compression. 
   Fuel injection Near TDC the fuel is injected by the injectors and the fuel starts to burn, further heating the gasses in the cylinder. 
   Power The piston passes TDC and the expanding gasses force the piston down, rotating the crankshaft. 
   Exhaust As the piston approaches BDC the exhaust valves or ports open and the exhaust gasses start to flow out of the cylinder. 
   &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In the following discussion of the diesel cycle it is important to keep in mind the time required for each of the actions to occur. Very little time is available to move exhaust gas out of, and fresh air into the cylinders, to compress the air, to inject fuel, and the fuel to burn. If a four-stroke diesel engine is running at a constant 2100 revolutions per minute , the crankshaft would be rotating at 35 revolutions, or 12,600 degrees, per second. One stroke is completed in about 0.01429 seconds.
Ignition occurs in a diesel by injecting fuel into the air charge which has been heated by compression to a temperature greater than the ignition point of the fuel.

            <Text>At the end of the recovery phase the plant will be stable, but may be in a vulnerable condition, with reduced capacity or redundancy. Therefore, any damaged equipment should be repaired as soon as possible, and the plant brought back to full operational status.   The chief will give the captain an estimate of how long it will take to make the plant fully operational, and do the paperwork  &lt;emdash/&gt;  fill out the logbook, casualty reports, and machinery histories.

Gauge to absolute Pressure 
Psig = psia - patm
US Customary System For shipboard purposes, you can simply add 14.7 psi to the gage reading in psi to get the absolute pressure. 
Gauge Pressure = 0 
Atmospheric Pressure = 14.7 psia 
Absolute Pressure = 14.7 psia 
Gage Pressure = 100 psig 
Atmospheric Pressure = 14.7 psia

Absolute Pressure = 14.7 psia + 100 psig 
Absolute Pressure = 114.7 psia 
SI System 
Gage Pressure = 0 kPa = Atmospheric Pressure = 101.325 kPa =14.7psia 
One Atmosphere =\frac{USSystem}{MetricSystem} = \frac{14.7psia}{101.325kPa} = .145 
Or 
One Atmosphere= \frac{MetricSystem}{USSystem} = \frac{101.325kPa}{14.7psia} = 6.89 
Example Problems: 
Convert 122 kPa to psi.

            <Text>
  Static discharge head is the vertical distance above the pump, in feet, between the centerline of the discharge connection and the liquid level in the discharge tank. The greater the discharge head, the more energy will be required to pump the liquid. Also, as the discharge head is increased, the pump capacity decreases; at a certain point the discharge drops to zero GPM, and the pump is no longer pumping.

            <Text>Hundreds of different types of pumps have been invented and improved over the years to meet every conceivable pumping requirement. These pumps differ in principles of operation and in design details; nevertheless, they may be broadly categorized according to their displacement characteristics, their delivery characteristics, and their suction characteristics. These broad categories are described in this section.

            <Title>Dry Pipe</Title>
            <Text>The dry pipe is located inside the steam drum, near the top. In its simplest form the dry pipe is simply a pipe with holes drilled into the top portion. Steam enters the dry pipe before it leaves the boiler.
The dry pipe is designed to allow steam to enter, but to exclude water droplets and moisture. Moisture in the steam, known as carryover  is bad, because high velocity water droplets in the steam can cause damage to the blades and thrust bearings in the turbine. Improper operation of the boiler, for instance letting the steam drum water level get too high, can cause carryover.

            <Title>Intake</Title>
            <Text>During the intake stroke fresh air for combustion is admitted into the cylinder.  This event actually begins slightly before the end of the previous cycle.
As the piston moves upward and slightly before top dead center (BTDC), the intake cam opens the intake valve. The intake stroke begins while the exhaust valve is still open.  The flow of the exhaust gases will have created a low pressure condition within the cylinder and will help pull in the fresh air charge. The piston continues its upward travel through top dead center (TDC) while fresh air enters and exhaust gases leave.  
Shortly after top dead center (ATDC), the camshaft rotates so that the exhaust cam starts allow the exhaust valve to close.  The necessary force is supplied by a valve spring, which was compressed when the valve was opened. The time frame during which both the intake and exhaust valves are open is called valve overlap and is necessary to allow the fresh air to help scavenge (remove) the spent exhaust gases and cool the cylinder. In most engines, 30 to 50 times cylinder volume is scavenged during overlap. This cool air also provides cools the engine parts. As the piston passes TDC and begins to travel down the cylinder bore, the movement of the piston creates a suction and continues to draw fresh air into the cylinder.

            <Title>Compression Connections</Title>
            <Text>In some systems, mechanically strong, leak tight connections can by compressing the pipe or tube in a compression or flare fitting.
Compression fittings are made up of three basic elements: the compression nut , the ferrule , and the body.  The tubing is slipped through the nut and the ferrule and then inserted into the end of the body.  By tightening the nut/screw the ferrule is forced into the fitting body. As the ferrule  moves axially into the fitting body, the body’s angled shape compresses the end of the ferrule onto the outer diameter of the tubing. It is this radial compression that creates a leak tight seal between the fitting, ferrule, and tubing, and gives the compression fitting its name.

&lt;/image&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

https://www.globalspec.com/learnmore/flow_control_fluid_transfer/pipe_tubing_hose_fittings_accessories/pipe_fittings
Flare fittings consist of a body with a flared or coned end. Special flaring tools are used to create a matching flare on the pipe.  The flare nut compresses the flare into the fitting body and creates the seal. Flare fittings can handle higher pressures and a wider range of operating parameters than standard compression fittings.

&lt;/figure&gt;

Compression connections are quick and require little skill to make, but they cannot withstand very high pressures.  Also, there are only a few materials that are suitably compressible (ex. copper, brass, plastic) to use this method.

In the example shown, the area of the square is 12 square units because 12-unit squares are needed to cover the surface enclosed by the square. 
The perimeter is defined as a measure of the length of the border that surrounds a closed geometric figure. The term perimeter derivates from the Greek words, ‘Peri’ and ‘meter’ which mean ‘around’ and ‘measure.’ In geometry, perimeter refers to the continuous line forming the path outside the two-dimensional shape. The area of a two-dimensional figure is defined as the amount of space inside the boundaries of the figure. It is a physical quantity that indicates the number of square units occupied by the two-dimensional object.</Text>

            <Text>Pipe and tube are manufactured using various materials.  The choice depends on factors such as the fluid being transported, temperature and pressure conditions, corrosion considerations, cost, USCG and ABS regulations 
Here are few of the materials used in shipboard piping systems. 
Welded carbon steel tubing is used for water, steam, and oil lines where the maximum temperature is below 450° F. There are several varieties of carbon steel and it is relatively cost-effective. 
Seamless carbon steel tubing is used in oil, steam, and feed water lines operating up to  775° F. 
Seamless carbon-molybdenum and chromium-molybdenum alloy steel tubing are used for high temperature, high pressure systems, up to 1500 psig and 1050° F for chrome-moly
Copper-nickel alloy tubing and Seamless brass tubing are both widely used in low pressure systems which must resist the corrosive action of salt water 
Nickel alloys, such as Monel and Inconel.  These are two families of high-performance alloys known for their exceptional resistance to corrosion, high temperatures, and various harsh environments.  
Seamless copper tubing is used for refrigeration lines, plumbing and heating systems, lubrication systems, and other shipboard systems. 
Seamless aluminum tubing is used for dry lines in sprinkling systems and for some bilge and sanitary drain systems.
Stainless steel tubing has excellent strength and corrosion resistance. It is often used in hydraulic systems.
Black iron pipe is an informal name for a mild-steel pipe that is used with threaded fittings for easy assembly of low pressure piping systems.  It is susceptible to galvanic corrosion, especially when it comes in contact with other materials in a salt water environment.

            <Text>Over the last 50 or so years steam and steam turbines as a means of ship propulsion have been supplanted by low and medium speed diesel engines, mainly because motor ships have better fuel efficiency, are easier to automate, requires less maintenance, and can be operated with smaller crews &lt;mdash/&gt; all factors leading to lower operating costs &lt;mdash/&gt; than steam ships. Nevertheless, steam propulsion remains important, because steam power is still used extensively in industry and power generation ashore, and the skills of a steam engineer find high demand in the shoreside job market.
In this chapter we will discuss the basics of marine steam propulsion and the steam cycle. The steam cycle is the thermodynamic process which marine engineers use to transform the energy contained in the ship’s fuel oil or &lt;em&gt;bunkers&lt;/em&gt; into the power to turn the ship’s propeller and supply all the other requirements necessary to move a steamship from one point to another. 
We will begin with a discussion of a very simplified version of the steam cycle, which nevertheless illustrates all its important principles. Then, we will progress to a more detailed, practical, and efficient version of the cycle, which more closely represents the cycle used on real steamships. The function of each of the components of the cycle will be briefly described here, but you will learn much more about them in your Steam Generator, Steam and Gas Turbines, and Thermodynamics classes.</Text>

            <Title>Piston and Piston Rings</Title>
            <Text>The piston transforms the energy of the expanding gases into mechanical energy. The piston rides in the cylinder liner or sleeve and the pressure of the combustion gases act on the piston head to move the piston dowm. This motion is transmitted through the connecting rod to rotate the crankshaft. Pistons are commonly made of aluminum or cast iron alloys. 
&lt;figure xml:id="piston-and-connecting-rod"&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt; Piston and Connecting Rod &lt;/caption&gt; 
  &lt;image source="images/diesel-image32.png" width="50%"/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
To prevent the combustion gases from bypassing the piston and to keep friction to a minimum, each piston has between 2 to 5 metal piston rings around it. These rings provide a seal between the piston and the cylinder wall and also reduce friction by minimizing the contact area between the piston and the cylinder wall and distributing lubricating oil. The rings are usually made of cast iron and coated with chrome or molybdenum. 
Each ring performs a distinct function. The uppermost rings acts primarily as the pressure seal and are known as compression rings. The intermediate rings acts as  wiper rings to remove and control the amount of oil film on the cylinder walls. The bottom rings are oiler rings and they ensure that the lubricating oil is evenly deposited on the cylinder walls.

            <Title>Boiler</Title>
            <Text>Heat energy is added to the cycle by burning fuel oil in the boiler. The high temperature flames raise the temperature of the water in the boiler and eventually cause it to boil. Not all energy of the fuel is transferred to the water, some remains in the combustion gases and travels up the stack. This energy will be lost to the atmosphere unless it is recovered by economizers or air heaters located in the exhaust path. Any heat energy lost to the atmosphere represents waste and steam cycle inefficiency.
Marine boilers supply the steam required for propulsion, as well as any other steam requirements of the vessel. Marine propulsion boilers are normally fired with heavy fuel oil, or in a few cases today, coal.  Marine boilers, while similar to boilers found ashore, are designed to meet the particular requirements of shipboard use. They are designed to be light and compact to fit into small engine rooms, capable of operating under rapidly changing loads when the vessel is maneuvering, and to operate reliably while the vessel is pitching and rolling during a storm.

 &lt;caption&gt;Typical Marine Boiler&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;image source="images/sg-0008.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Diesel and gas turbine powered ships are often equipped with smaller auxiliary boilers to supply the steam for quarters and cargo cargo heating, &lt;etc/&gt;  The heat source for auxiliary boilers can be fuel oil, diesel oil, or the waste heat from the main propulsion diesel engine. </Text>

            <Title>Introduction</Title>
            <Text>A diesel engine is a type of internal combustion engine in which the chemical energy of fuel is converted into work.  Diesel engines provide a rugged, efficient, versatile, self-contained source of power.
These engines come in sizes ranging from a few horsepower to over 100,000. Within the limits of its range of horsepower, the diesel engine is one of the most efficient source of power available. 
Diesels are widely used in a wide variety of commercial and industrial applications including electrical generation. In the field of transportation, they power locomotives, construction equipment, vehicles, and all varieties of oceangoing vessels. 
Diesel engines can operate on a wide variety of liquid fuel oils. Most small and medium engines operate on petroleum diesel fuel, which is a distilled from crude oil, while large slow speed marine engines operate on Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO). There is a growing trend for engines to run on gaseous fuels such as natural gas or bio-gas.  Engines which can operate on a combination of liquid and gaseous fuels are called dual-fuel.

 Conversion of Heat to Work.   The burning of fuel and air in the engine cylinder with the piston close to the top point of travel (top dead center) causes a marked increase in the pressure and temperature in the combustion space over the piston.  This pressure “P” on pounds per square inch, Figure 1-1, on each square inch of top of the piston acts through a connecting rod to exert a force on the crank pin.  This causes the crankshaft to rotate as indicated by the arrow.

#
As the piston is forced down, the pressure of 800 to over 1400 PSI and temperatures that can reach 3,500⁰ will decrease as the gas expands.  As the piston approaches the bottom point of travel (bottom dead center), pressure will be approximately 50 PSI and temperature close to 800⁰ just before the exhaust valve or ports opens.  During this stroke of the piston, a large portion of the energy released from the fuel during combustion will have been converted into rotational force on the crankshaft.  The crankshaft is then capable of transmitting this rotational force and doing work.

            <Text>Measurement is the process of associating numbers with quantities. Units of measurement establish a common language for engineers to communicate and quantify various physical quantities. There are two basic standard units of measurement systems that are used worldwide, the U.S. Standard Measurement System and the Metric System.
In the world of engineering, measurement is fundamental. Accurate measurements are crucial for designing, constructing, and evaluating systems. Engineers rely on standardized units and principles of measurement to ensure consistency and precision in their work.
This chapter provides an overview of the categories and units of measurement used in engineering systems, covering both the metric and US standard systems as well as nautical measurement. An overview of basic instruments used for making measurements will be discussed along with the principles of measurement including accuracy, efficiency, percent error and deviation.
As you study this chapter, you will encounter new terms and definitions for you to learn. At the end of the chapter, you will find example problems. Be sure to take the time to practice with these problems. They will help prepare you to apply these concepts.</Text>

Inadequate storage practices may also result in spills, leaks, or contamination, endangering both employees and the environment. 
It is essential to follow proper storage procedures, including segregating incompatible chemicals, labeling containers correctly, ensuring proper ventilation and temperature control, and implementing appropriate containment measures such as spill kits and secondary containment systems.  The MSDS will contain instructions regarding proper storage.
In particular, aboard ship chemical containers must always be secured so that they don’t break free and cause accidents during heavy weather.   </Text>

            <Text>Mass is a fundamental property of matter that quantifies the amount of substance within an object. It is a measure of an object's resistance to acceleration when a force is applied, and it also determines the strength of its gravitational attraction to other objects.  The greater the mass of an object, the heavier it is on earth and the more force is required to accelerate or decelerate it. 
Force is any action that tends to maintain, alter or distort the motion of a body.  Force can be caused by contact with another object, or due to the remote effects of gravity, magnetism, or other influences.  More simply, a force is a push or a pull.  One common example of force is weight, which is the effect of gravity on a mass.</Text>

The Diode Front End  which takes in an AC power supply from the mains and converts it into DC power using a three-phase rectifier. 
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
The DC Capacitor  The rectified power is stored in a large capacitor, which acts as a buffer to provide a stable DC voltage to the DC Bus.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;
The Inverter The inverter is responsible for converting the DC power back into AC power with variable voltage and frequency. This stage utilizes power electronic devices, such as insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs), to switch the DC voltage in a controlled manner. 
To synthesize the desired AC waveform, the VFD uses a technique called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). PWM involves rapidly switching the IGBTs on and off to create a series of voltage pulses with varying widths. By adjusting the width of these pulses, the VFD can control the effective voltage and frequency of the output AC waveform.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <Text>Manometers
Pressure can be measured directly by measurement of the applied force. 
Before mechanical manometers and electronic diaphragm pressure sensors were invented, pressure was measured by liquid manometers with mercury or water. 
Mercury (abbreviated Hg) heavier liquid metal 
Fresh Water (abbreviated H20) 
Mercury 
Mercury is a useful material to use in a manometer because of its high density. This means that a much shorter column is needed compared to water. 
Mercury is commonly used in barometers because its high density means the height of the column can be a reasonable size to measure atmospheric pressure. A barometer using water, for instance, would need to be 13.6 times taller than a mercury barometer to obtain the same pressure difference. This is because mercury is 13.6 times denser than water. 
1 inch of mercury = .491 psi 
1 pound of mercury = 2.036 inches 
1 inch of mercury = 13.6 inches of water 
1 inch of water =.0736 inches of mercury 
A manometer is a simple instrument used to measure pressure differences in a fluid. It typically involves a column of liquid, and the pressure difference causes a change in the liquid's height, which can be measured to determine the pressure, dependent upon the liquid’s density. 
A U-tube manometer is probably the most common manometer in use today. These devices typically use a column of liquid to indicate the pressure difference between two points. Pressure is read on a scale as the difference in height (h) between the two liquid columns. The units of measure commonly used are inches of water and inches of mercury. 
Measuring pressure 
In a U-tube manometer the tube is filled until both sides are approximately half full. When the pressures are equal, the column of liquid on each side will be at the same height. This is usually marked as zero on a scale. 
With both sides of the manometer open to the atmosphere, the fluid level on one side will be the same as the level on the other side because P1 equals P2. 
U-tube manometer 
Now suppose one end of the U-tube manometer is connected to an unknown pressure P1 whose value must be determined. The other end is left exposed to the atmospheric pressure, P2. 
The difference in the height of the liquid on the two sides of the tube is the differential pressure. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;U-tube manometer utilizing water&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image11.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
The total difference in liquid height is 4 units, which means that our pressure differential is 4 inches of water column. 
Figure 1. With both ends of the tube open, the liquid is at the same height in each leg. 
Figure 2. When positive pressure is applied to one leg, the liquid is forced down in that leg and up in the other. The difference in height, “h,” which is the sum of the readings above and below zero, indicates pressure. 
Figure 3. When a vacuum is applied to one leg, the liquid rises in that leg and falls in the other. The difference in height, “h,” which is the sum of the readings above and below zero, indicates the amount of the vacuum. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Manometer&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image12.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Types of fluids 
As we said earlier, a manometer is filled with a liquid. Typical manometer liquids are mercury, water, and light oils. 
It’s worth saying here that mercury was a common manometer fluid in the past, but has largely been replaced due to its environmental and health hazards. 
Quite often the liquid is colored to help detect the fluid movement. Here, the specific gravity of the manometer fluids must be included to convert Head to pressure. 
Pressure =\frac{HeadXS.G}{2.31}

            <Text>Marine boilers provide the steam to turn the propeller, power the generators, make fresh water, operate steam driven pumps and blowers, heat the quarters, support the galley, and meet all other steam requirements of the ship. Operation of the boilers is critical to the operation of the vessel, and marine engineers must have a thorough understanding of boilers in order to operate them safely and economically. Boilers can be dangerous. Improper actions or inactions can lead to a boiler explosion, likely killing everyone in the engine room and perhaps everyone on the ship. The US Coast Guard requires all operators of marine boilers to be competent, and you can not operate a boiler until you have been trained, acquired the required sea experience, and passed the US Coast Guard license exam. Coast Guard Licensing requirements came about as a result of many tragic boiler explosions in the early years of steam propulsion, including the explosion of the &lt;em&gt;Sultana&lt;/em&gt;, which killed over 1500 Union soldiers returning home from Vicksburg, Mississippi in April 1865. 
There are many different types of marine boilers. Boilers on steam driven ships are considered &lt;em&gt;propulsion boilers&lt;/em&gt;, and are designed to meet the large steam demands of the main engines, as well as all the other steam requirements of the vessel. Diesel and gas turbine powered ships are equipped with smaller &lt;em&gt;auxiliary boilers&lt;/em&gt; to supply the steam requirements of these vessels. Propulsion boilers are normally fired with heavy fuel oil, or in a few cases today, coal, while the heat source for auxiliary boilers is either fuel oil, diesel oil, or the waste heat from the main propulsion diesel or gas turbine. Marine boilers, while similar to boilers found ashore, are designed to meet the particular requirements of shipboard use. They are designed to be light and compact to fit into small engine rooms, capable of operating under rapidly changing loads when the vessel is maneuvering, and to operate reliably while the vessel is pitching and rolling during a storm.

            <Title>Length Measuring Instruments</Title>
            <Text>Rulers and Yardsticks are straight, flat measuring tools commonly used for shorter lengths. A ruler measure 1 ft. or 12 inches whereas a yardstick measure 3 ft. or 1 yd. A Tape Measure is a flexible tape marked with inches and feet for measuring longer distances. It is often used in construction and carpentry.  A surveyor's tape is a long, flexible tape marked in meters used in land surveying.

Calipers are used to measure the dimensions of an object, generally by placing two movable points of the instrument across the object or span to be measured.  Calipers use a Vernier scale to increase measuring accuracy.

A micrometer, sometimes known as a micrometer screw gauge, is a device incorporating a calibrated screw widely used for accurate measurement of components. Outside, inside, and depth micrometers are all used. The outside micrometer has a unit conversion chart between fractional and decimal inch measurements etched onto the frame

A Surveyor's Wheel, also known as a "measuring wheel" or "click wheel," surveyor's wheels are used to measure longer distances, such as those encountered in land surveying. They are often used for irregularly shaped areas. 
&lt;figure&gt;

A sextant is a navigation instrument used to determine a ship's position at sea.  With the ship's position accurately known, the distance to the destination can be measured on a nautical chart..

Laser measuring tools send a beam to the target, which reflects off the surface and is sent back to the device. Lasers are focused beams of light that stay at a particular frequency. And because they travel from one place to another at a fairly constant rate, they can be used to measure distance with a great deal of accuracy. A laser measuring device also has a longer range than many other measuring tools, which gives it an advantage over other devices that become less precise the farther out you measure. Lasers are less likely to disperse than white light, so they can travel at a greater distance without losing their intensity. They keep most of their intensity once they reflect off a target, which is important if you want to get accurate distance measurements.

            <Text>Insulators, or nonconductors, are materials with electrons that are tightly bound to their atoms and require large amounts of energy to free them from the influence of the nucleus. The atoms of good insulators have their valence shells filled with eight electrons, which means they are more than half filled. Any energy applied to such an atom will be distributed among a relatively large number of electrons. Examples of insulators are rubber, plastics, glass, and dry wood.

            <Title>Compression</Title>
            <Text>At 35° after bottom dead center (ABDC), the intake valve starts to close. At 43° ABDC (or 137° BTDC), the intake valve is on its seat and is fully closed. At this point the air charge is at normal pressure (14.7 psia) and ambient air temperature (~80°F), as illustrated in Figure 17. At about 70° BTDC, the piston has traveled about 2.125 inches, or about half of its stroke, thus reducing the volume in the cylinder by half. The temperature has now doubled to ~160°F and pressure is ~34 psia. At about 43° BTDC the piston has traveled upward 3.062 inches of its stroke and the volume is once again halved. Consequently, the temperature again doubles to about 320°F and pressure is ~85 psia. When the piston has traveled to 3.530 inches of its stroke the volume is again halved and temperature reaches ~640°F and pressure 277 psia. When the piston has traveled to 3.757 inches of its stroke, or the volume is again halved, the temperature climbs to 1280°F and pressure reaches 742 psia. With a piston area of 9.616 in2 the pressure in the cylinder is exerting a force of approximately 7135 lb. or 3-1/2 tons of force. The above numbers are ideal and provide a good example of what is occurring in an engine during compression. In an actual engine, pressures reach only about 690 psia. This is due primarily to the heat loss to the surrounding engine parts.

            <Title>Personal Protective Equipment</Title>
            <Text>&lt;introduction&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
Personal protective equipment (PPE) includes all clothing and other work accessories designed to create a barrier against workplace hazards. It provides an important link in the chain of workplace safety, but PPE alone is not a substitute for safe engineering design, proper training, good work practices, safety awareness, or hazard reduction. All these elements together are required to minimize the danger of workplace hazards and maximize the safety and health of workers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Using personal protective equipment requires hazard awareness and training on the part of the user. You must be trained to know when personal protective equipment is necessary, what type is necessary, how it is to be worn, and what its limitations are, as well as know its proper care, maintenance, useful life, and disposal. In addition, you must be aware that the equipment does not eliminate the hazard. If the equipment fails, you can be injured. To reduce the possibility of failure, equipment must be properly fitted, and maintained in a clean and serviceable condition. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
To protect yourself, you must be wearing the proper personal protective when it is needed and recognize its limitations. The equipment must not be altered or removed even though you may find it uncomfortable. In some cases however, the equipment may be uncomfortable because it does not fit properly. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In this chapter we will discuss some of the personal protective equipment normally found and used aboard ship. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/introduction&gt; 
&lt;section xml:id="headprotection"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Head Protection&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;introduction&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
Head injuries are caused by falling or flying objects, or by bumping your head against a fixed object. Head protection, in the form of protective hats, must do two things – resist penetration and absorb the shock of the blow. This is accomplished by making the shell of the hat of a material hard enough to resist the blow, and by utilizing a shock-absorbing lining composed of headband and crown straps to keep the shell away from the wearer’s skull. Protective hats are also used to protect against electric shock. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/introduction&gt;

&lt;subsection xml:id="typesofheadprotection"&gt; 
&lt;title&gt;Types of Head Protection&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Class A.&lt;/term&gt; Class A hard hats and caps are intended for general service and they provide protection against impact hazards and a limited protection against electrical shock. They are used in industries such as construction, manufacturing, mining, and shipbuilding. This is the most suitable hard hat for shipboard use. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Class B.&lt;/term&gt; Class B hard hats are utility service hats which are designed to protect the wearer’s head from impact and penetration by falling or flying objects and from high-voltage shock and burns. They are used extensively by electrical workers. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure xml:id="hardhats_jpg"&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Hard Hat&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;image source="pics/ppe/hardhats.jpg" /&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Class C.&lt;/term&gt; The safety hat or cap in Class C is designed specifically for lightweight comfort and impact protection and is sometimes known as a bump cap. Class C helmets are used on occasions where there is a possibility of bumping the head against a fixed object and no danger from falling objects or electrical shock. Bump caps can be worn for protection against scalp lacerations from contact with sharp objects. However, they are not substitutes for safety caps/hats because they do not afford protection from high impact forces or penetration by falling objects. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/subsection&gt; &lt;subsection xml:id="fit"&gt; 
&lt;title&gt;Fit&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Correct adjustment and fit of the your hard hat is required for maximum safety. The internal cradle of the headband and sweatband forms a suspension system which keeps the helmet away from the head and cushions against impact. The headband must be adjusted to the right size in order to provide sufficient clearance between the shell and the headband. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before using a hard hat you should inspect it for signs of damage or abuse of the helmet or any of its parts. A damaged helmet reduces the margin of safety the hat was designed to supply, and should be replaced immediately. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/subsection&gt; 
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section xml:id="eyeprotection"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Eye Protection&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;introduction&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
Every day more than 1,000 eye injuries occur in American workplaces. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics found that three out of five workers who suffered eye injuries were not wearing eye protective equipment at the time of the accident, and when asked why, the victims often claimed that eye protection was not normally used in their type of work, or it was not required for the type of work performed at the time of the accident. Eye protection can save your sight, but you must be wearing it. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Eye injuries can occur in many ways, but are primarily caused by rapidly flying objects. The BLS found that almost 70% of eye injuries were caused by flying or falling objects or sparks striking the eye. Most of these objects were smaller than a pin head, and were traveling faster than a hand-thrown object. Another 20% of eye injuries were caused by chemicals, and the remainder due to miscellaneous causes such as objects swinging into the eye, pulled into the eye or by light radiation. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Eye injuries can be prevented by wearing effective eye protection. To be effective, the eyewear must be of the appropriate type for the hazard encountered and properly fitted. The BLS survey found that 94% of the injuries to workers wearing eye protection were caused by objects or chemicals going around or under the protector. Goggles provide better protection than face shields or safety glasses, but the best protection is afforded when both goggles and a face shield are worn together. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/introduction&gt; &lt;subsection xml:id="typesofeyeprotection"&gt; 
&lt;title&gt;Types of Eye Protection&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The three main types of eye protection for general maintenance are safety glasses, goggles, and face shields. In addition, when welding, specialized equipment must be used to protect your eyes. Each method of eye protection has its own advantages and disadvantages. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Safety Glasses.&lt;/term&gt; Safety glasses are lightweight glasses that have shatter resistant lenses made of materials like polycarbonate or propionate plastic and often have side shields attached to the side pieces. Safety glasses are designed to stop flying objects such as chips, fragments, sand, and dirt from injuring your eyes. They also can provide laser light filtration to prevent reflections from the laser entering the eye and causing retinal burns. Safety glasses can be purchased with prescription lenses including bifocals if necessary. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The main advantage of safety glasses is that they are lightweight and relatively comfortable to wear for long periods of time. The provide little to no protection from liquids or vapors, and some flying particles may get around the side shields. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure xml:id="goggles_jpg"&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Types of Eye Protection&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;image source="pics/ppe/goggles.jpg" /&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Goggles.&lt;/term&gt; Goggles provide more complete protection of the eye than safety glasses, since they protect against both frontal and side impact. They come in two different types, vented and non-vented. Vented goggles are used to protect your eyes from splashes and flying objects, while Non-vented Goggles additionally protect your eyes from hazardous vapors, mists, and fumes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Face Shields.&lt;/term&gt; Face shields are designed to augment other types of eye protection and are not meant to be a stand alone form of eye protection. Face shields are used to protect your entire face with goggles on under the shield to catch any liquids that might make it past the shield. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/subsection&gt; &lt;subsection xml:id="eyeprotectionforwelding"&gt; 
&lt;title&gt;Eye Protection for Welding&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Always wear a welding helmet when arc welding. Your eyes, face, and neck need protection against the burning rays of the arc, and from the splatter of molten metal and slag. To protect your eyesight, make sure the welding helmet has a colored lens with at least a No. 10 shade when welding with 200 amperes or less. And never strike a welding arc before your helmet is in place. Never look at an arc from any distance with your naked eyes while someone else is welding. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Never chip slag when your eyes (or those of others nearby) are not protected by goggles, an eye shield, or the clear lens of a welding helmet. If fragments of hot slag were to hit the eye, medical attention would be required for their removal, and blindness could result. The risk of permanent eye injury is so great that you should never chip slag from a weld without protecting your eyes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/subsection&gt; 
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section xml:id="hearingprotection"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Hearing Protection&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;introduction&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
Over the years, many marine engineers have suffered permanent hearing loss due to hours of exposure to the high noise levels in the engine room. You can prevent the loss of your own hearing by using proper hearing protection such as earplugs and earmuffs religiously whenever you are exposed to loud noises. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Your ear is a delicate instrument which contains thousands of fine hair cells called cilia to detect sounds. Prolonged exposure to loud noises can injure or break these cells or even tear off groups of these cells. Since the hair cells don’t ever repair themselves, when enough of them are damaged, a hearing loss results. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Short, intense, sounds such as an explosion can cause immediate and permanent hearing loss, but most hearing loss occurs gradually due to prolonged exposure to high noise levels. Most of the time this loss is so gradual that you are not even aware that it is occurring. Hearing loss is progressive and will continue to get worse as you continue to expose yourself to a noisy environment, but if you can avoid further exposure, the hearing loss won’t get any worse. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Permanent hearing loss is not the only hazard associated with noisy environments. Tinnitus is a condition where a ringing or roaring sound is heard continuously in one or both ears. Tinnitus occurs when the hair cells are damaged in such a way that they produce sound signals to the brain even in the absence of actual stimulation. This noise is sometimes described as like having a cricket permanently stuck in your ear, and is very annoying. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sound intensity is measured in units of &lt;em&gt;decibels&lt;/em&gt; (dB). The decibel scale is a logarithmic scale in which 0 dB indicates the quietest sound that can be heard by a normal person. A quiet library is about 20 dB. A normal conversation occurs at a sound level of about 60 dB. A lawnmower produces about 85 dB, and at this level you should be wearing hearing protection. Sandblasting or a rock concert has a sound intensity of about 115 dB. At this level hearing damage can occur after only about 15 minutes of unprotected exposure. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
According to OSHA regulations, when the 8 hour average noise exposure is above 85 dB, employers are required to institute a noise monitoring program, provide adequate hearing protectors, and ensure employees wear them. Continual, unprotected exposure to noises louder than 85 decibels for 8 hours or more can be dangerous, and may result in hearing loss. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can easily tell if you should be wearing hearing protection. If you find yourself in a situation where it is too noisy to carry on a conversation at arms length, or if you notice that your ears ring or feel plugged for a time after leaving a noisy environment, you can be sure that you should have been wearing your hearing protection. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;title&gt;Types of Hearing Protectors&lt;/title&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Disposable foam plugs.&lt;/term&gt; Foam plugs are inexpensive devices made of a formable material designed to expand to fit to the shape of each person’s ear canal. To use, roll the expandable plugs into a thin, crease-free cylinder, and insert it into the ear canal. Apply a slight pressure to the plug until the foam completely expands. These plugs can be reused a couple of times, but never reuse them if they have become dirty. Some people may find that the standard expandable plug is too large for their ear canal, and may find that the smaller plug model fits better. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Reusable, pre-molded plugs.&lt;/term&gt; Pre-molded plugs are made from silicone, plastic or rubber and are manufactured as either &lt;q&gt;one-size-fits-most&lt;/q&gt; or are available in several sizes. Be sure to choose the proper size for your ear canals. In some cases, different size plugs may be required for each ear. The advantage of pre-molded plugs are that they are inexpensive, reusable, washable, convenient to carry, and come in a variety of sizes. Nearly everyone can find a plug that will be comfortable and effective. Another advantage is that in a dirty environment like the engine room, you don’t need to handle or roll the tips. You insert this type of plug by reaching over your head with one hand to pull up on your ear. Then use your other hand to insert the plug with a gentle rocking motion until you have sealed the ear canal. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Hearing Bands.&lt;/term&gt; Hearing Bands, also called canal caps or semi-insert devices often resemble earplugs on a flexible plastic or metal band. The earplug tips of a canal cap may be a formable or pre-molded material. Some have headbands that can be worn over the head, behind the neck or under the chin. The main advantage of canal caps is their convenience They are easy to put on and take off . When it’s quiet, employees can leave the band hanging around their necks, but they can quickly insert the plug tips when hazardous noise starts again. These devices are ideal for intermittent use, but they provide less protection then either plugs or muffs. Some people find the pressure from the bands uncomfortable. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;assemblage xml:id="what_is_a_decibel"&gt; 
&lt;title&gt;What is a Decibel?&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Decibel (dB) is a logarithmic unit used to describe a ratio. The ratio may be power, or voltage or intensity or several other things. To get a taste for logarithmic units, first let’s look at some numbers: Suppose we have two loudspeakers, the first playing a sound with power &lt;m&gt;P_1&lt;/m&gt;, and another playing a louder version of the same sound with power &lt;m&gt;P_2&lt;/m&gt;, but everything else (how far away, frequency) is kept the same. The difference in decibels between the two is given by &lt;me&gt;10 \log (P_2/P_1) \text{ dB}&lt;/me&gt; where the log is to base 10. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the second produces twice as much power than the first, the difference in dB is &lt;me&gt; 10 \log (P_2/P_1) = 10 \log 2 = 3 \text{ dB}&lt;/me&gt;. If the second had 10 times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be &lt;me&gt;10 \log (P_2/P_1) = 10 \log 10 = 10 \text{ dB}&lt;/me&gt;B. If the second had a million times the power of the first, the difference in dB would be &lt;me&gt; 10 \log (P_2/P_1) = 10 \log 1,000,000 = 60 \text{ dB} &lt;/me&gt;. This example shows one feature of decibel scales that is useful in discussing sound: they can describe very big ratios in power with numbers of modest size. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sound is usually measured with microphones and they respond (approximately) proportionally to the sound pressure, &lt;m&gt;p&lt;/m&gt;. The power in a sound wave is approximately equal to the square of the pressure. Since the log of the square of &lt;m&gt;x&lt;/m&gt; is just &lt;m&gt; 2 \log x &lt;/m&gt;, this introduces a factor of 2 when we convert to decibels for pressures. Therefore the difference in sound pressure level between two sounds with &lt;m&gt;p_1&lt;/m&gt; and &lt;m&gt;p_2&lt;/m&gt; is defined as: &lt;me&gt; 20 \log (p_2/ p_1) \text{ dB}&lt;/me&gt; where the log is to base 10. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This formula involves a ratio of pressures, so to measure the sound level for a single sound, a reference level must be chosen. For sound intensity, the reference level (for air) is usually chosen as 20 micropascals, or 0.02 mPa. This is very low: it is 2 ten billionths of an atmosphere. Nevertheless, this is about the limit of sensitivity of the human ear, in its most sensitive range of frequency. Usually this sensitivity is only found in rather young people or in people who have not been exposed to loud music or other loud noises. Personal music systems with in-ear speakers are capable of very high sound levels in the ear, and are responsible for much of the hearing loss in young adults in developed countries. So if you read of a sound intensity level of 86 dB, it means that &lt;m&gt;20 \log (p_2/p_1) = 86 &lt;/m&gt; dB where &lt;m&gt;p_1&lt;/m&gt; is the sound pressure of the reference level, and &lt;m&gt;p_2&lt;/m&gt; that of the sound in question. Divide both sides by 20: &lt;m&gt;\log (p_2/p_1) = 4.3 &lt;/m&gt; dB. 4 is the log of 10 thousand, 0.3 is the log of 2, so this sound has a sound pressure 20 thousand times greater than that of the reference level. 86 dB is a loud but not dangerous level of sound, if it is not maintained for very long. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What does 0 dB mean? This level occurs when the measured intensity is equal to the reference level. i.e., it is the sound level corresponding to 0.02 mPa. In this case we have sound level &lt;me&gt; = 20 \log (p / p_{ref}) = 20 \log 1 = 0 \text{ dB}&lt;/me&gt;. So 0 dB does not mean no sound, it means a sound level where the sound pressure is equal to that of the reference level. This is a small pressure, but not zero. It is also possible to have negative sound levels: - 20 dB would mean a sound with pressure 10 times smaller than the reference pressure, i.e. 2 micropascals. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/assemblage&gt; &lt;/subsection&gt; 
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section xml:id="respiratoryprotection"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Respiratory Protection&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;introduction&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
A respirator is a face piece, hood, or helmet that is designed to protect the user from a variety of harmful airborne agents. Respirators can protect you from dust and particulates in the air, hazardous vapors, oxygen deficiency, or a combination of these. Respirators are not necessary for routine operations in the engine room, but may be advisable during certain maintenance procedures such as chipping and painting. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
OSHA regulations require that respirators shall be used in the following circumstances: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Where exposure levels exceed the &lt;em&gt;permissible exposure limit&lt;/em&gt; (PEL), during the time period necessary to install or implement feasible engineering and work practice controls; 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		In those maintenance and repair activities and during those brief or intermittent operations where exposures exceed the PEL and engineering and work practice controls are not feasible or are not required; 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		In regulated areas; 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Where the employer has implemented all feasible engineering and work practice controls and such controls are not sufficient to reduce exposures to or below the PEL; and, 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		In emergencies. 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before using a respirator you should be thoroughly trained in its use. Some of the areas that you should be familiar with include: respiratory hazards; respirator selection criteria, limitations, adjustment, fit, cleaning, and storage procedures, etc. The selection of a suitable respirator depends on the hazard to which you are exposed, and the correct respirator cannot be selected without a thorough understanding of the hazard. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/introduction&gt; &lt;subsection xml:id="typesofrespirators"&gt; 
&lt;title&gt;Types of Respirators&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
OSHA divides respirators into two categories: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure xml:id="respirators1_jpg"&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Air-purifying respirator&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;image source="pics/ppe/respirators1.jpg" width="50%" /&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Air-purifying Respirators.&lt;/term&gt; These units have filters, cartridges, or canisters that remove contaminants from the air by passing the air through the air-purifying element before it reaches the user. Air purifying respirators are further divided into: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;Particulate Respirators&lt;/em&gt;, which capture particles such as dusts, paint fumes, and mists, but do not protect against gases and vapors. The filters in particulate respirators generally work better as particles accumulate on the filter. If the filter becomes so clogged that it is difficult to breathe, it should be replaced. 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;Gas and Vapor Respirators&lt;/em&gt;, which use a chemical cartridge or canister to remove dangerous gases or vapors, but which do not protect against airborne particles. These units only protect against specific gases or vapors, and only provide protection as long as the filter’s absorbing capacity remains. 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;Combination Respirators&lt;/em&gt;, which can be used in atmospheres that contain both hazardous gases and particles. 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure xml:id="respirators2_jpg"&gt;
&lt;caption&gt;Atmosphere-supplying respirators&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;image source="pics/ppe/respirators2.jpg" width="50%" /&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Atmosphere-supplying Respirators.&lt;/term&gt; These units supply clean air directly to the user from a source other than the air surrounding the user. The types of air-supplying respirators are: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;Air Supplied Respirators&lt;/em&gt;, which have a hose which connects to a source of clean air under pressure. These units have no time limit on the air supply, but the hose limits the range and mobility of the user and is susceptible to damage. 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus&lt;/em&gt;, which have a wearable clean-air supply pack. These units have better mobility than the air-supplied respirator, but the clean air time is limited to the capacity of the tank. 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;em&gt;Combination Respirators&lt;/em&gt;, which are similar to the air-supplied respirators, but also have a small, self-contained air supply which can be used for escape if the primary supply fails. 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/subsection&gt; 
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section xml:id="armandhandprotection"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Arm and Hand Protection&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;introduction&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
The National Safety Council has found that hands are the body part most frequently injured on the job. Accidents to the hand fall into these categories: abrasions, cuts, punctures, crushes, contact with moving machinery, burns, and chemical injuries. Gloves and hand protection are available to protect you from nearly all of these hazards. However, glove selection must be based on performance characteristics of the gloves, conditions, durations of use, and hazards present. One type of glove will not work in all situations. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the engine room, particular hazards include high temperatures and moving machinery. Long sleeved shirts are advisable to protect your arms, and you should always have a pair of work gloves available to use when necessary to protect your hands when working around hot pipes. Special high temperature gloves should always be worn when changing burners, and the appropriate chemical resistant gloves should be worn when working with burner cleaning and boiler chemicals. You should also pay particular attention to avoid contact with moving parts of machinery or power tools with moving parts, and insure that safety guards are always in place. Gloves should always be inspected for damage before use. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/introduction&gt; &lt;subsection xml:id="typesofgloves"&gt; 
&lt;title&gt;Types of Gloves&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There is a broad selection of safety gloves available to protect your hands from workplace hazards. For example: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Disposable Gloves - protects against mild irritants and bodily fluids 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Rubber Lineman’s Gloves and sleeves - protects against shock when working on live wires 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Metal Mesh Gloves - protects against accidental cuts when using knives 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Chemical Resistant Gloves - proper selection of material can resists chemical attack 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Cleanroom Gloves - maintains cleanliness of electronic parts 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Cotton Work Gloves - improves grip and protects from heat and cold 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		General Purpose Leather Gloves - protects against cuts and moderate temperatures 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Temperature Resistant Gloves - protects from high temperatures 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Welder’s Gloves - protects from high temperatures and sparks 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/subsection&gt; 
&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section xml:id="footprotection"&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Foot Protection&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;introduction&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;
Your feet are vulnerable to many potential hazards aboard ship. For example, slips and falls due to wet and slippery decks; heavy objects falling on or rolling over your foot because of the ship’s motion or accident; punctures caused by stepping on sharp objects; and potential electrical shock when your body is grounded through the soles of your shoes. In other industries, there are other hazards to consider, chemical exposure, high temperatures, molten metal splashes, static electricity, to name a few. Proper selection of footwear can minimize the danger of these hazards. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
OSHA has established regulations for safety shoe design, including impact and compression strength requirements, and they have mandated footwear requirements for many industries. For example, safety shoes or boots with impact protection are required to be worn in work areas where carrying or handling materials such as packages, objects, parts or heavy tools, which could be dropped; and for other activities where objects might fall onto the feet. Safety shoes or boots with compression protection are required for work activities involving skid trucks (manual materials handling cars) or other activities in which materials or equipment could potentially roll over an employee’s feet. Safety shoes or boots with puncture protection are required where sharp objects such as nails, wire, tacks, screws, large staples, scrap metal etc., could be stepped on by employees causing a foot injury. Although there are no specific OSHA requirements for safety footwear for marine engineers, it is nonetheless sensible to select and wear safety shoes based on the hazards found in the engine room. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/introduction&gt; &lt;subsection xml:id="typesofsafetyshoes"&gt; 
&lt;title&gt;Types of Safety Shoes&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Safety Shoes and Boots.&lt;/term&gt; Safety shoes and boots are available in many styles depending on the job requirements. Boots provide more protection than shoes from chemicals and molten metals splashes and spark hazards, but they are heavier. Some protective features that are available in both boots and shoes include: 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Oil resistant shoes 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Chemical resistant shoes 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Heat resistant shoes 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Slip and skid resistant shoes 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;
		Waterproof and water resistant shoes 
	&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Steel-Reinforced Safety Shoes and Boots.&lt;/term&gt; Similar to safety shoes, these have the toe box and insole reinforced with steel, and the instep reinforced with steel, aluminum, or plastic. These shoes will protect your feet from falling objects and puncture injuries. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Electrically Insulated Safety Shoes.&lt;/term&gt; These shoes have non-conductive soles to prevent the wearer’s feet from completing an electrical circuit to ground. They can protect workers against as much as 600 volts in dry conditions. These shoes should be used in conjunction with insulated tools and precautions to reduce or eliminate the potential for providing a path for hazardous electrical energy. Non-conductive footwear must not be used in explosive or hazardous locations; in such locations, electrically conductive shoes are required. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;term&gt;Electrically Conductive Safety Shoes.&lt;/term&gt; These shoes protect against the buildup of static electricity. Essentially, these shoes ground the employees wearing them. Employees working in explosive and hazardous locations such as explosives manufacturing facilities or grain elevators must wear conductive shoes to reduce the risk of static electricity buildup on an employee’s body that could produce a spark and cause an explosion or fire. During training, employees must be instructed not to use foot powder or wear socks made of silk, wool, or nylon with conductive shoes. Foot powder insulates and retards the conductive ability of the shoes. Silk, wool, and nylon produce static electricity. Conductive shoes are not general-purpose shoes and must be removed upon completion of the tasks for which they are required. Employees exposed to electrical hazards must &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; wear conductive shoes. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/subsection&gt; 
&lt;/section&gt;

            <Title>You can never have too much information</Title>
            <Text>A good engineer must have a thorough knowledge of the plant.  When you arrive onboard, trace out all major systems and learn the location of all critical valves, so that you can quickly locate and use them in an emergency.  You should particularly look for crossover valves that are not normally used, but which may become important for restoring service after a failure, and isolation valves for securing portions of piping systems.  You should also locate all available safety equipment, and the location of engineroom exits.
You need to be thoroughly familiar with the normal operation of the plant. Without a knowledge of normal operating temperatures, pressures, noises, smells, vibrations, and familiarity with the way the system responds to changing loads, it is next to impossible for you to recognize the signs of impending trouble.  Most of this information can be obtained by good watchstanding -- making thorough rounds, remembering what you see, and reviewing the logbook for trends.  You can also refer to the ship's manuals and discuss normal operating conditions with the other engineers onboard.
Finally, you should be completely comfortable with normal startup and shutdown procedures, because in many cases, the most appropriate response to a casualty is to quickly and safely start up a stand-by unit and secure the faulty one before things get worse.
When a casualty occurs, you will need timely and accurate information.  The alarm and instruments on the console will probably be your first notification of a problem, so it is vitally important to keep them in good working order.  If a gage or thermometer gives any indication that is is faulty: sticking pointer, bogus readings, etc. it should be replaced, repaired, or re-calibrated without delay.  Console alarm points should be adjusted to minimize nuisance alarms.  Don't take anything for granted; always investigate every alarm on the board.  Don't become complacent and ignore alarms because "it was like that when I got here" or  "it always does that."

            <Title>Slips, trips and falls</Title>
            <Text>According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, slips, trips, and falls cause nearly 700 fatalities per year and many more injurious accidents in the workplace,
Common trip and fall hazards include obstructions on walkways, such as cables, tools, or equipment left in pathways. Uneven surfaces, loose gratings, and obstructions, can also contribute to tripping incidents. Additionally, poor lighting, cluttered work areas, improper storage of materials, and inadequate lighting can increase the risk of trips and falls.  
Spilled liquids, oils, or water can make surfaces extremely slippery. Wet surfaces due to cleaning or maintenance activities, and the presence of loose debris are additional factors that can contribute to slip incidents.
Falls can be particularly dangerous when you are working at above the ground, such as on a ladder, scaffolding or staging.
Aboard ship, additional hazards exist due to the dynamic and often wet environment. Obstructions such as hatch combings, pad-eyes and container hold-downs can cause individuals to trip. Slip hazards arise from seawater or rainwater on deck surfaces, spilled liquids in galley areas, or lubricants used for machinery maintenance.  In rough seas, the motion of the ship can cause unsecured objects to fall, or cause you to lose your balance and fall. You must be particularly careful when working at heights or over the side. Always follow the old adage, “one hand for the ship and one hand for yourself.</Text>

            <Text>Globe valves are used in throttling applications, that is, anytime you want to   regulate or control the amount of liquid flowing through a system, you could select a   globe valve. A bathroom sink faucet or a garden hose spigot are common examples of globe   valves found around the house. In a globe valve, the moving part (called the &lt;em&gt;valve     disk&lt;/em&gt;) blocks an opening in the valve (called the &lt;em&gt;seat&lt;/em&gt;) to shut off flow,   and when the valve stem is turned, the disk moves away from the seat – in the path of   the fluid flow – as the valve is opened. To close the globe valve, the disk is moved   back towards the seat until they touch, seal, and stop the fluid flow through the valve.

            <Text>Diesel engine speed is controlled solely by the amount of fuel injected into the engine by the injectors. Because a diesel engine is not self-speed-limiting, it requires not only a means of changing engine speed (throttle control) but also a means of maintaining the desired speed. The governor provides the engine with the feedback mechanism to change speed as needed and to maintain a speed once reached. 
A governor is essentially a speed-sensitive device, designed to maintain a constant engine speed regardless of load variation. Since all governors used on diesel engines control engine speed through the regulation of the quantity of fuel delivered to the cylinders, these governors may be classified as speed-regulating governors. As with the engines themselves there are many types and variations of governors. In this module, only the common mechanical-hydraulic type governor will be reviewed. 
The major function of the governor is determined by the application of the engine. In an engine that is required to come up and run at only a single speed regardless of load, the governor is called a constant-speed type governor. If the engine is manually controlled, or controlled by an outside device with engine speed being controlled over a range, the governor is called a variable- speed type governor. If the engine governor is designed to keep the engine speed above a minimum and below a maximum, then the governor is a speed-limiting type. The last category of governor is the load limiting type. This type of governor limits fuel to ensure that the engine is not loaded above a specified limit. Note that many governors act to perform several of these functions simultaneously.</Text>

            <Text>If water is detected in the fuel but the fires haven't gone out, slow the ship down to conserve steam, and switch to the other settling tank or to the settler high suction from the console.  

If the fires go out, secure the fuel supply, slow down and initiate a forced shutdown of the boiler.  Then switch to a good fuel source, purge the boiler and light off again.

Since loss of the boiler affects the turbogenerator, consider starting the auxiliary generator at the first signs of trouble.

Water and  contaminated fuel may be quickly returned to the port settler by opening the manual dump valve which is located in the fuel oil return line.  This valve is found just forward of the steps leading from the port boiler to the refrigeration flat, at deck height.</Text>

            <Text>In a diesel engine, exhaust temperatures are very important and can provide a vast amount of information regarding the operation of the engine. High exhaust temperature can indicate an overloading of the engine or possible poor performance due to inadequate scavenging (the cooling effect) in the engine. Extended operation with high exhaust temperatures can result in damage to the exhaust valves, piston, and cylinders. The exhaust temperature usually provides only an alarm function.</Text>

            <Title>Superheater Vent</Title>
            <Text>Whenever there is a flame in the boiler, there must be steam flow through the superheater. Without this steam flow, the superheater tubes will overheat and burn out. Insuring steam flow through the superheater is not a problem when the boiler is operating on the line, since the normal flow to the turbine and auxiliaries provides sufficient flow, but it is significant during the boiler warm up period and during boiler casualties. At these times, it is critical to open the &lt;em&gt;superheater vent valve&lt;/em&gt; located on the superheater outlet. Opening this valve permits a small amount of steam to flow up the smokestack and provide sufficient cooling to protect the superheater.

            <Title>Steam Drum</Title>
            <Text>The steam drum is located near the top of the boiler and should normally be half filled with water and the remainder filled with steam. A gage glass on the steam drum allows the operator to determine the water level in the boiler. Too little water would be very dangerous, because without water in the boiler the heat of the flames would melt the boiler tubes and destroy the boiler.
Steam is formed in the boiler tubes, and since steam bubbles are less dense than the surrounding liquid water, they float up to the top of the boiler and eventually rise above the surface of the water in the steam drum. If the steam was allowed to build up in the drum, the boiler pressure would quickly rise, and if not relieved by the safety valves, would cause the boiler to explode. The system is designed to remove steam as quickly as it is created, so a properly operated boiler will maintain a constant pressure.

            <Title>Gauge Vacuum (inHg)</Title>
            <Text>Bourdon Tube Vacuum Gauges are used to measure pressures less than atmospheric pressure with the Vacuum Gauge range from 0 to 30 inches Hg. Atmospheric pressure at Sea Level is 14.7 psia or 101.325 kPa, which corresponds to 0 gauge. When in use and the vacuum increasing, the needle will move towards larger numbers with 29.92 inHg being the greatest achievable vacuum at Sea Level, as per Torricelli’s experiment. 
Vacuum pressure gauges and Pressure gauges, both start at zero-gauge pressure with zero-gauge pressure corresponding to atmospheric pressure. When the vacuum pressure gauge decreases below atmospheric, the vacuum gauge needle will begin to move off zero and move towards 29.92 in Hg gauge, stopping at the reduced pressure being measured. The value of 29.92 inches of mercury (inHg) gauge corresponds to the maximum possible vacuum that can be achieved relative to the atmospheric pressure. 
0 Gauge Pressure = Atmospheric Pressure, 14.7 psia in US Customary Units or 101.325 kPa in SI Units. 
Almost all Vacuum Gauge readings will be somewhere between 0 and 29.92 inHg 
In working with Inches Mercury Gauge readings, it is essential to convert those readings into psia (absolute) values. The converted readings can be used when consulting Steam Tables for additional properties related those readings.

   &lt;/tabular&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
Let’s say the Vacuum Gauge indicates 10 inHg. 
This indicates the pressure is &lt;em&gt;less than&lt;/em&gt; atmospheric pressure and mercury is the measuring element. This reading, in Inches Mercury (inHg), must be converted to PSIA to utilize Steam Tables that are established on PSIA. 
Knowing One Inch of Mercury exerts .491 psi Hg 
10 inHg gauge can be multiplied by .491 psi Hg equaling 4.91 psi 
Knowing 14.7 psia is Atmospheric Pressure and that inHg vacuum gauges indicate less than atmospheric: 
Vacuum Gauge Reading Equivalent psia = 14.7 psia – (10 inHg x .491 psi Hg) 
= 14.7 psia – (4.91 psi) 
= 9.79 psia</Text>

            <Text>Turbocharging an engine occurs when the engine's own exhaust gasses are forced through a turbine (impeller), which rotates and is connected to a second impeller located in the fresh air intake system. The impeller in the fresh air intake system compresses the fresh air. The compressed air serves two functions. First, it increases the engine's available power by increasing the maximum amount of air (oxygen) that is forced into each cylinder. This allows more fuel to be injected and more power to be produced by the engine. The second function is to increase intake pressure. This improves the scavenging of the exhaust gasses out of the cylinder. Turbocharging is commonly found on high power four-stroke engines. It can also be used on two-stroke engines where the increase in intake pressure generated by the turbocharger is required to force the fresh air charge into the cylinder and help force the exhaust gasses out of the cylinder to enable the engine to run.</Text>

            <Title>Manometers</Title>
            <Text>A manometer is another pressure measuring  instrument. Unlike a barometer, which measures atmospheric pressure, a manometer is used to measure the pressure above or below atmospheric, or the pressure difference between two points. 
The manometer consists of a U-shaped tube filled with liquid, usually mercury or water.  
When the pressures on both sides of the manometer are equal, the fluid levels will equalize, but if two different pressures are applied , the levels  will adjust until the pressures are balanced by the weight of liquid in the higher leg.  The height difference (h) between the twp surfaces corresponds to the pressure difference.  
When one leg is open to the atmosphere, the pressure difference represents a gauge pressure.

For a U-tube manometer the pressure difference \Delta p  is calculated using the formula: &lt;men xml:id='rho-g-h'&gt;\Delta p = \rho g h&lt;/men&gt;  where \rho is the density of the liquid in the manometer,  g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height difference between the liquid columns.

The difference between soldering and brazing has to do with the filler material, particularly its melting temperature.

Solder is an alloy that melts at 840 F or less.  Solder is composed primarily of tin, mixed with other metals such as nickel for added strength. Solder used to be a tin/lead mixture, but that is no longer used due to health risks of exposing drinking water to lead pipes.  Soldering is easier to learn than brazing and soldered joints can be reheated and taken apart.  
Brazing alloys melt above 840 degrees.  Brazing alloys are typically made of a mix of copper and phosphorus or silver mixed with other elements.  Brazing creates a stronger connection than soldering that is less likely to leak.  
Because of the relatively low melting temperatures, neither method can be used for high-temperature applications.

            <Text>Low oil pressure or loss of oil pressure can destroy an engine in short order. Therefore, most medium to larger engines will stop upon low or loss of oil pressure. Loss of oil pressure can result in the engine seizing due to lack of lubrication. Engines with mechanical-hydraulic governors will also stop due to the lack of oil to the governor. 
The oil pressure sensor usually stops the engine. The oil pressure sensors on larger engines usually have two low pressure setpoints. One setpoint provides early warning of abnormal oil pressure, an alarm function only. The second setpoint can be set to shutdown the engine before permanent damage is done.

            <Title>Power-ROGER</Title>
            <Text>&lt;em&gt;Power&lt;/em&gt; is defined as the amount of energy used per unit time or rate of doing work. It has the units of watt, Btu, horsepower, or ft-lb/sec. Power is a measure of the rate at which energy is used. 
Regarding work, when you lift a weight of 1 pound through a distance of 1 foot, you have done 1 foot-pound of &lt;em&gt;work,&lt;/em&gt; regardless of whether you do it in half a second or half an hour. A device which can do a lot of work quickly is powerful. Power, however, is time dependent. Therefore, if you lift that same 1-pound weight over the same distance more quickly, you are more powerful! 
The common unit of measurement for power is the &lt;em&gt;horsepower&lt;/em&gt; (hp). 
Power is a critical physical quantity that defines the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred or converted. In the world of engineering, power plays a significant role in designing efficient systems, analyzing energy consumption, and optimizing engineering solutions. Understanding power and its measurement is essential for creating sustainable technologies, enhancing performance, and addressing real-world challenges. Let's explore how power is measured in both the US standard and metric systems, the instruments used for measurement, and any nautical-specific measurements related to power. 
Forms of Power 
In the context of science, power can refer to different concepts depending on the specific field or application. Here are several forms of power in various scientific contexts: 
Mechanical Power: In classical mechanics, mechanical power is the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred. It is the product of force and velocity. Mechanical power is the term used to describe when work is being done. 
Electrical Power: In electrical systems, power is the rate at which electrical energy is transferred or converted. It is measured in watts and is the product of voltage and current. 
Thermal Power: In thermodynamics, thermal power refers to the rate at which heat energy is transferred or converted. It is often measured in watts and is associated with processes involving temperature differentials. Thermal power is the term used to refer to the transfer of heat. 
Nuclear Power: In the context of nuclear physics, power can refer to the rate of energy release in nuclear reactions. Nuclear power is harnessed in nuclear reactors for electricity generation. 
Solar Power: This is a form of power derived from the sun's radiation. Solar power can be harnessed through various technologies such as photovoltaic cells and solar thermal systems. 
Wind Power: Wind power is the conversion of wind energy into a useful form, typically electricity, using wind turbines. 
Hydraulic Power: In fluid dynamics, hydraulic power is associated with the movement and pressure of fluids. It is often utilized in hydraulic systems for various applications. 
Chemical Power: In chemistry, chemical reactions can release or store energy. Chemical power is associated with the energy changes in chemical reactions. 
Muscular Power: In biology and biomechanics, muscular power refers to the rate at which work is done by muscles. It is often expressed in terms of force and velocity of muscle contraction. 
Photon Power: In optics, the power of a lens is a measure of its ability to converge or diverge light. It is often measured in diopters. 
UNITS of POWER 
Power is measured in various units depending on the context and the system of measurement being used. The standard unit of power in the International System of Units (SI) is the watt (W). Here are some common units of power: 
Watt (W): The watt is the SI unit of power and is defined as one joule per second. It is named after James Watt, a Scottish engineer. 
Kilowatt (kW): One kilowatt is equal to 1,000 watts. It is commonly used in the context of electrical power, especially in the rating of appliances and electrical systems. 
Megawatt (MW): One megawatt is equal to 1 million watts or 1,000 kilowatts. This unit is often used in the context of large-scale power generation and distribution. 
Gigawatt (GW): One gigawatt is equal to 1 billion watts or 1,000 megawatts. It is commonly used to express the capacity of power plants or large energy systems. 
Calories per Second (cal/s or kcal/s): In some contexts, especially in the field of nutrition and metabolic studies, power can be expressed in terms of calories per second. 
BTU per Hour (BTU/h): In the field of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), power is sometimes measured in British Thermal Units per hour. 
Horsepower (hp): Horsepower is a unit of power that is still used in various industries, particularly in the context of engines and motors. One horsepower is approximately equal to 745.7 watts. 
Foot-Pound per Minute (ft-lb/min): This unit is often used in the context of mechanical power, where work is done over time. 
These units provide a way to quantify and compare the rate at which energy is transferred or converted in various scientific and engineering applications. 
In the context of mechanics and engineering, mechanical power refers to the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred within a mechanical system. It is a measure of how quickly energy is used or produced in a mechanical process. The unit of mechanical power is the watt (W). 

   &lt;em&gt;Measurement of Power:&lt;/em&gt;

US Standard System: 
In the US standard system, power is typically measured in horsepower (hp). One horsepower is equivalent to 550 foot-pounds per second (ft-lb/s) or approximately 746 watts. It is a common unit used to express the power output of engines, motors, and other mechanical systems. 
One mechanical horsepower is defined as the ability to do 550 foot-pounds of work per second. In other words, if a machine can exert a force of 550 pounds over a distance of one foot in one second, it is considered to have a power output of 1 mechanical horsepower. This definition was based on Watt's observations of the work done by draft horses in coal mines and was intended to provide a meaningful measure of power that people could relate to in the late 18th century. 
While the original concept of horsepower was rooted in the comparison to the work done by horses, it has become a standard unit of power used in various industries, particularly in the automotive and mechanical engineering fields, to express the power output of engines and motors. 
By definition, 1 horsepower is equal to 33,000 foot-pounds of work per minute or 550 foot-pounds of work per second. 
Thus, a machine that is capable of doing 550 foot-pounds of work per second is said to be a 1-horsepower machine. (As you can see, your horsepower rating would not be very impressive if you did 1 foot-pound of work in half an hour. Figure it out. It works out to be just a little more than one-millionth of a horsepower.) 
Horsepower (hp) is a unit of measurement in the English system, sometimes used to express the rate at which mechanical energy is expended. 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;A horse produces approximately one horsepower&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image48.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Metric System: 
In the metric system, power is measured in watts (W). One watt is defined as one joule per second (J/s), representing the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred. The watt is the standard unit for expressing power in the International System of Units (SI). 
In the International System of Units (SI), power is typically measured in watts. One mechanical horsepower is equivalent to approximately 745.7 watts. The conversion factor is often rounded to 746 watts for practical use. So, when you see a power rating for an engine or motor in horsepower, it represents the mechanical power output of that device. 
Power Formulas 
The formula for mechanical power is derived from the basic definition of power: 
Mechanical Power (P)=\frac{Work(w)}{Time(t)}

​Alternatively, if the system involves a force (F) acting over a distance (d), the formula for mechanical power can be expressed as: 

   &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=\frac{Fxd}{t}

​In this formula: 

   &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; is the mechanical power 

   &lt;em&gt;W&lt;/em&gt; is the work done,

Mechanical Power 
Mechanical energy used per unit time is called &lt;em&gt;mechanical power&lt;/em&gt;. Mechanical power is the rate at which work is done. Mechanical power is expressed in units of joules/sec (joules/s) or a watt (W) in the metric system, and feet - pounds force per second (ft-lbf/s) or horsepower (hp) in the English system. Mechanical power can be calculated using the following mathematical expression. 
Power= \frac{WorkDone}{Timerequired}

Because work can be defined as force times distance, we can also use the following equation: 

   &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=\frac{Fxd}{t}

Mechanical Power Problem US Customary Units 
A worker uses a winch to lift a 200-pound load to a height of 30 feet in 2 minutes. Calculate the mechanical power in foot-pounds per minute. 
Mechanical power (P) can be calculated using the formula: 
Power= \frac{WorkDone}{Timerequired}

where: 
W is the work done in foot-pounds (ft-lb) 
T is the time in minutes (min) 
First, calculate the work done (W). Work done is given by: 
W=F×d 
where: 
F is the force applied (in pounds, lb) 
D is the distance the load is lifted (in feet, ft) 
Given: 
F=200 lb. 
d=30 ft 
Calculate the work done (W): 
Power= \frac{WorkDone}{Timerequired}


   &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=\frac{Fxd}{t}

W=F×d=200 lb×30 ft=6000 ft-lb 
Next, calculate the power (P): 
Mechanical Power (P)=\frac{Work(w)}{Time(t)}

Power = \frac{6,000ft - lbs}{2minutes}

Answer: 
The mechanical power used by the winch is 3000 foot-pounds per minute (ft-lb/min). 
Note that the work required is the same even with more people pulling the load. 
Mechanical Power Problem Metric System Units 
Given: 
Force (F) =50 (Newtons) N 
Distance (d)=20 (Meters) m 
Time (t)=10 seconds (s) 
Step-by-step calculation: 
Calculate the work done W=F⋅d=50 N×20 m=1000  
Calculate the power: Power (P)=\frac{Work(w)}{Time(t)} = \frac{1000j}{10s} =100 J/s 
So, the mechanical power delivered by the conveyor belt is 100 joules per second. 
Horsepower Formula: Horsepower = \frac{Work}{Timex33,000}

Horsepower may also be expressed as 
1 hp = \frac{33,000foot - pounds}{minute} or 
1 hp = \frac{550foot - pounds}{second}

Horsepower Problem: 
A motor exerts a force to lift a weight of 500 pounds vertically at a constant speed of 660 feet per minute. Calculate the horsepower delivered by the motor. 
Solution: 
Recall the definition of horsepower: 
1 horsepower (hp)=33,000 foot-pounds per minute (ft-lb/min) 
Given: 
Force F = 500 pounds 
Speed = 660 feet per minute 
Power in foot-pounds per minute is calculated as: 
Horsepower = \frac{Work}{Timex33,000} = \frac{Forcexdistance}{timex33,000}


   &lt;me&gt;Horsepower = \frac{500lbsx660feet}{33,000ft - lbs/min}&lt;/me&gt;

Horsepower = 10hp 
Thermal Power Problem in British Thermal Units (BTU’s) 

   &lt;em&gt;Thermal power&lt;/em&gt; is the measure of thermal energy used per unit time. It is the rate of heat transfer or heat flow rate. Examples of thermal power units are British Thermal Units (Btu) or kilowatts (kW). Thermal power is calculated basically by the mathematical expression of: 
Thermal Power= \frac{HeatUsed}{TimeRequired}

P= \frac{Heat}{time} = \frac{Q(btu's)}{t(s)}

Problem: 
A heating system uses 90,000 btus of heat energy to warm a room over a period of 15 minutes. Calculate the thermal power output of the heating system in btus). 
To calculate the thermal power output of the heating system, we can use the formula: 
P= \frac{Heat}{time} = \frac{Q(btu's)}{t(s)}

In this case: 
The energy used is 90,000 BTUs. 
The time period is 15 minutes. 
First, we need to convert the time period from minutes to hours since power is typically measured in BTUs per hour (BTU/hr). 
15 minutes=15/60 hours=0.25 hours 
Now, we can calculate the power: 
Power=90,000 BTUs/0.25 hours​ 
Power=360,000 BTU/hr 
So, the thermal power output of the heating system is 360,000 BTU/hr. 
Electric Power Problem in Watts 
When dealing with electrical power, it's essential to consider the relationship between power, voltage, and current, which is given by the formula: 

   &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;=&lt;em&gt;VI&lt;/em&gt;

where: 

   &lt;em&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; is power in watts (W) 

   &lt;em&gt;V&lt;/em&gt; is voltage in volts (V) 

   &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; is current in amperes (A) 
Problem: 
An electric heater has a resistance of 10 ohms and is connected to a 120-volt power supply. Calculate the electrical power consumed by the heater in watts. 
Solution: 
Electrical power (P) can be calculated using Ohm's law and the power formula: 
P=​ \frac{V^{2}}{R}

where: 
P is the power in watts (W) 
V is the voltage in volts (V) 
R is the resistance in ohms (Ω) 
Given: 
V=120 V 
R=10 Ω 
First, substitute the given values into the formula: 
P= ​ \frac{V^{2}}{R} P=​ \frac{120^{2}}{10\Omega}

P= \frac{14400v}{10\Omega} = 1440 watts (W) 
Answer: 
The electrical power consumed by the heater is 1440 watts (W). 
Power is expressible also as the product of the &lt;em&gt;force&lt;/em&gt; applied to move an object and the speed of the object in the direction of the force. If the magnitude of the force &lt;em&gt;F&lt;/em&gt; is measured in pounds and the speed &lt;em&gt;ν&lt;/em&gt; in feet per minute, the power equals &lt;em&gt;Fν&lt;/em&gt; foot-pounds per minute. In the &lt;em&gt;International System of Units&lt;/em&gt;, power is measured in &lt;em&gt;newton&lt;/em&gt; meters per second. 
Most machines have rotating &lt;em&gt;shafts&lt;/em&gt;, and, in terms of the twisting moment, or magnitude of &lt;em&gt;torque&lt;/em&gt; (τ), on a shaft and the angular speed ω of the shaft, the power is given by τω. τ is usually expressed in inch-pounds, ω in radians per second, and power in inch-pounds per second. Another unit of mechanical power is the &lt;em&gt;horsepower&lt;/em&gt; (hp), which is equal to 33,000 foot-pounds per minute, or 6,600 inch-pounds per second. 
Instruments Used to Measure Power: 
Dynamometer: an instrument used to measure torque and power output of engines, motors, and other rotating machinery. By measuring the torque and rotational speed, the dynamometer can calculate the power output of the system. 
Power Meter: an electronic device used to measure electrical power consumption. It is commonly used to monitor and optimize the energy usage of electrical devices and systems. 
Nautical-Specific Power Measurements 
In the nautical world, power measurements are crucial for marine engineering, ship propulsion, and navigation. Two nautical-specific power measurements are: 
Propulsion Power: Propulsion power refers to the power required to drive a ship or boat through water. It is a key parameter in designing efficient propulsion systems and optimizing fuel consumption for maritime vessels. 
Dynamic Positioning Power: Dynamic positioning (DP) systems are used on ships and offshore platforms to maintain their position without anchoring. The power required for DP operations is a critical consideration in offshore engineering projects. 
Understanding the concept of power and its measurement is vital in your journey as engineering students. It will empower you to design energy-efficient systems, optimize power consumption, and contribute to sustainable engineering practices both on land and at sea.</Text>

            <Text>Fuel in a liquid state is injected into the cylinder as a fine mix (atomization), as shown in &lt;xref ref="fuel-injection-pic"/&gt;.   The fuel must be injected at a precise time and rate to ensure that the combustion pressure on the piston occurs neither too early nor too late.
The fuel enters the cylinder where the heated compressed air is present; however, it will only burn when it is in a vaporized state (attained through the addition of heat to cause vaporization) and intimately mixed with a supply of oxygen. The first minute droplets of fuel enter the combustion chamber and are quickly vaporized. The vaporization of the fuel causes the air surrounding the fuel to cool and it requires time for the air to reheat sufficiently to ignite the vaporized fuel. But once ignition has started, the additional heat from combustion helps to further vaporize the new fuel entering the chamber, as long as oxygen is present. Fuel injection starts at 28° BTDC and ends at 3° ATDC; therefore, fuel is injected for a duration of 31°.

            <Text>A barometer is an instrument used to measure atmospheric pressure.  There are two basic types of barometers:
The mercury barometer, which was invented by Evangelista Torricelli in 1643, consists of a glass tube, closed at one end and filled with mercury. The open end of the tube is placed in a reservoir of mercury. Atmospheric pressure pushes down on the surface of the mercury in the reservoir, causing the mercury in the tube to rise or fall. The height of the mercury column in the tube, usually measured in millimeters or inches, indicates the atmospheric pressure.  Mercury is used in barometers because its high density means the height of the column can be a reasonable size to measure atmospheric pressure.  A barometer using water, for instance, would need to be about 34 feet tall, while a mercury barometer less than three feet tall.. 
The aneroid barometer contains a small, flexible metal box called an aneroid chamber, which is tightly sealed and partially evacuated of air. Changes in atmospheric pressure cause the cell to expand or contract. This movement drives levers and springs that move a needle on a dial to indicate the pressure reading. Aneroid barometers are more portable and durable than mercury barometers.

            <Title> Camshaft,  Valve Mechanism, and Timing Gears</Title>
            <Text>In order for a diesel engine to operate, all of its components must perform their functions at very precise intervals in relation to the motion of the piston. To accomplish this, a component called a camshaft is used. &lt;xref ref="camshaft-and-drive-gear"/&gt; illustrates a camshaft and camshaft drive gear. 
A camshaft is a long bar with egg-shaped eccentric lobes called cams, one lobe for each valve and fuel injector (discussed later). 
&lt;figure xml:id="camshaft-and-drive-gear"&gt;  
   &lt;caption&gt;Camshaft and Drive Gear &lt;/caption&gt; 
  &lt;image source="images/camshaft" width="50%"&gt; &lt;remix&gt;&lt;source href="https://www.standards.doe.gov/standards-documents/1000/1018-bhdbk-1993-v1"&gt;DOE FUNDAMENTALS HANDBOOK MECHANICAL SCIENCE, US DOE Publication DOE-HDBK-1018/1-93&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/remix&gt;&lt;/image&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 
Each lobe has a cam follower as shown on &lt;xref ref="valve-gear"/&gt;. As the camshaft is rotated, the follower is forced up and down as it follows the profile of the cam lobe. The followers are connected to the engine's valves and fuel injectors through various types of linkages called pushrods and rocker arms. The pushrods and rocker arms transfer the reciprocating motion generated by the camshaft lobes to the valves and injectors, opening and closing them as needed. The valves are maintained closed by valve springs. 
As the valve is opened by the camshaft, it compresses the valve spring. The energy stored in the valve spring is then used to close the valve as the camshaft lobe rotates out from under the follower. Because an engine experiences fairly large changes in temperature (e.g., from ambient to a normal running temperature of about 190 °F), its components must be designed to allow for thermal expansion. Therefore, the valves, valve pushrods, and rocker arms must have some method of allowing for the expansion. This is accomplished by the use of valve lash. Valve lash is the term given to the &lt;q&gt;slop&lt;/q&gt; or &lt;q&gt;give&lt;/q&gt; in the valve train before the cam actually starts to open the valve. 
&lt;figure xml:id="valve-gear"&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Diesel Engine Valve Train &lt;/caption&gt; 
  &lt;image source="images/valve-gear.png" width="50%"/&gt; 
&lt;/figure&gt;
The camshaft is driven by the engine's crankshaft through a series of gears called idler gears and timing gears. The gears allow the rotation of the camshaft to correspond or be in time with, the rotation of the crankshaft and thereby allows the valve opening, valve closing, and injection of fuel to be timed to occur at precise intervals in the piston's travel. To increase the flexibility in timing the valve opening, valve closing, and injection of fuel, and to increase power or to reduce cost, an engine may have one or more camshafts. Typically, in a medium to large V-type engine, each bank will have one or more camshafts per head. In the larger engines, the intake valves, exhaust valves, and fuel injectors may share a common camshaft or have independent camshafts. 
Depending on the type and make of the engine, the location of the camshaft or shafts varies. The camshaft(s) in an in-line engine is usually found either in the head of the engine or in the top of the block running down one side of the cylinder bank. &lt;xref ref="valve-gear"/&gt; provides an example of an engine with the camshaft located on the side of the engine. &lt;xref ref="two-stroke-V-engine"/&gt;  provides an example of an overhead cam arrangement as on a V-type engine. On small or mid-sized V-type engines, the camshaft is usually located in the block at the center of the V between the two banks of cylinders. In larger or multi-cam shafted V- type engines, the camshafts are usually located in the heads.</Text>

            <Title>The Generation of Steam</Title>
            <Text>When a liquid boils, it generates a vapor, that is, some or all of the liquid changes its physical state from liquid to gas (or vapor). As long as the vapor is in contact with the liquid from which it is being generated, it remains at the same temperature as the boiling liquid. In this condition, the liquid and its vapor are said to be in &lt;em&gt;equilibrium contact&lt;/em&gt; with each other. 
The temperature at which a boiling liquid and its vapor may exist in equilibrium contact depends on the pressure under which the process takes place. As the pressure increases, the boiling temperature increases. As the pressure decreases, the boiling temperature decreases. For each liquid, therefore, the boiling point is determined by the pressure. 
When a liquid is boiling and generating vapor, the liquid is called a &lt;em&gt;saturated liquid&lt;/em&gt;, and the vapor is called a &lt;em&gt;saturated vapor&lt;/em&gt;. The temperature at which a liquid boils under a given pressure is called the &lt;em&gt;saturation temperature&lt;/em&gt;, and the corresponding pressure is called the &lt;em&gt;saturation pressure&lt;/em&gt;. For each pressure there is a corresponding saturation temperature, and for each temperature there is a corresponding saturation pressure. A few saturation pressures and temperatures for water are listed below. 
Atmospheric pressure is 14.7 psia at sea level and lesser at higher altitudes. Trying to cook potatoes at the top of a high mountain takes a great deal longer than it would at sea level. Why is this? As noted before, temperature and pressure are indications of internal energy. Since it is not possible to raise the temperature of the boiling water above the saturation temperature for that pressure, the amount of internal energy available for cooking the potatoes is much less at high altitudes than it is at sea level. By the same line of reasoning, you should be able to figure out why the potatoes cook faster in a pressure cooker than in an open kettle. 
A peculiar thing happens to water and steam at an absolute pressure of 3206.2 psia and the corresponding saturation temperature at 705.40 °F. At this point, which is called the &lt;em&gt;critical point,&lt;/em&gt; the vapor and the liquid are indistinguishable. No change of state occurs when the pressure is increased above this point or when heat is added. At the critical point, we can no longer refer to &lt;q&gt;water&lt;/q&gt; or &lt;q&gt;steam,&lt;/q&gt; since we cannot tell the water and steam apart. Instead, the substance is merely called a &lt;q&gt;fluid&lt;/q&gt; or a &lt;q&gt;working substance.&lt;/q&gt; Boilers designed to operate at pressures and temperatures above the critical point are called &lt;em&gt;supercritical&lt;/em&gt; boilers. Supercritical boilers are not used, at present, in propulsion plants of ships; however, some boilers of this type are used in stationary steam power plants. 
If we generate steam by boiling water in an open pan at atmospheric pressure, the water and the steam which is in immediate contact with the water will remain at 212 °F until all the water has been evaporated. If we fit an absolutely tight cover to the pan, so that no steam can escape while we continue to add heat, both the pressure and the temperature inside the vessel will rise. The steam and water will both increase in temperature and pressure, and each fluid will be at the same temperature and pressure as the other. 
In operation, a boiler is neither an open vessel nor a closed vessel. Instead, it is a vessel designed with restricted openings which allow steam to escape at a uniform rate while feedwater is being brought in at a uniform rate. After boiler operating pressure has been reached, therefore, the process of steam generation in a boiler takes place at constant pressure and constant temperature, if we disregard any fluctuations that may be caused by changes in steam demands. 
Although it is impossible to raise the temperature of the steam in the steam drum above the temperature of the water from which it is being generated, we can raise the temperature of the steam if we first remove the steam from contact with the water inside the steam drum and then add heat. Steam which has been heated above its saturation temperature for any given pressure is called &lt;em&gt;superheated steam&lt;/em&gt;, and the vessel in which the saturated steam is superheated is called a &lt;em&gt;superheater.&lt;/em&gt;The amount by which the temperature of the superheated steam exceeds the temperature of saturated steam at the same pressure is known as the &lt;em&gt;degree of superheat&lt;/em&gt;. For example, if saturated steam at a pressure of 620 psia and the corresponding saturation temperature of 490 °F is superheated to 790 °F, the degree of superheat is 300 °F. 
All ship’s propulsion boilers are equipped with superheaters. The primary advantage is that superheating the steam provides a greater temperature differential between the boiler and the condenser, thus allowing more heat to be converted to work at the turbines. Another advantage is that superheated steam is dry and therefore causes relatively little corrosion or erosion of machinery and piping. Also, superheated steam does not conduct heat as rapidly (and therefore does not lose heat as rapidly) as saturated steam. The increased efficiency which results from the use of superheated steam reduces the amount of fuel oil required to generate each pound of steam, and so reduces the space and weight requirements for the boilers. 
It should be noted, however, that most auxiliary machinery is designed to operate on saturated steam. Reciprocating machinery in particular requires saturated steam for the lubrication of internal moving parts of the steam end. Ship’s boilers, therefore, are designed to produce both saturated steam and superheated steam.

1. Voltage Regulation: The excitation system adjusts the generator's field current to maintain a steady voltage output, typically at a specified set point. This ensures that the generator can provide a constant and stable supply of electrical power.

2. Reactive Power Control: The excitation system controls the generator's reactive power output. Reactive power is required to maintain voltage stability in power systems and is important for reactive power compensation and voltage control in transmission and distribution networks.

3. System Stability: The excitation system plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the power system. It helps to dampen system oscillations and supports the overall stability of the interconnected grid by adjusting the generator's excitation level in response to changes in system conditions.

4. Fault Ride-Through Capability: In the event of a fault or disturbance in the power system, the excitation system can provide additional field current to the generator to enhance its ability to ride through the fault without tripping offline.

5. Synchronization: The excitation system assists in synchronizing the generator with the rest of the power system. It ensures that the generator's output voltage matches the system voltage during the connection process, allowing for smooth and seamless integration of the generator into the grid.

            <Text>There are two basic systems utilized today for measurement, the US Standard and the SI, or International System. The unit of measurement used depends upon what System(s) are involved, and therefore Conversion factors are used to go between systems. We have seen this in the chapter sections on length, area, volume, and time. In terms of measuring pressure, the US System uses psi or pounds per square inch. The International System uses newtons per centimeter squared, or kilopascals (kPa).</Text>

            <Text>Voltage, or electric potential difference, is a fundamental concept in electricity.  Voltage  is measured in units of volts (V), and symbolized as V.  Voltage can be seen as the &lt;q&gt;push&lt;/q&gt; or&lt;q&gt;force&lt;/q&gt; that propels electric charges within a circuit. When voltage is applied to a circuit, it creates an electric field that influences the movement of charged particles, resulting in the establishment of an electric current. In simpler terms, voltage serves as the driving force behind the flow of electric charges in an electrical system.
Voltage can be produced through several methods, including chemical reactions (such as in batteries) and the photovoltaic effect (as in solar cells). However, the most important method of is electromagnetic induction.  Electromagnetic induction is the process where a changing magnetic field induces (creates) an electric voltage in a nearby conductor.   This phenomenon is the basis for generating electricity in devices like generators and transformers.  Electrical generators will be described in more detail in &lt;xref provisional="generators"/&gt;
Current refers to the flow of electric charge in an electrical circuit. It is the rate at which electric charges, typically electrons, move through a conductor. Current is measured in amperes (A) and is represented by the symbol I. It can be thought of as the quantity of charge passing through a point in a circuit per unit of time. The flow of current occurs when there is a potential difference (voltage) applied across a conductor, providing the driving force for the movement of electric charges.
Resistance is a property of a material or component in an electrical circuit that opposes the flow of electric current. It is measured in ohms (Ω) and is denoted by the symbol R. Resistance determines the extent to which a material or device hinders the flow of electrical charge. When a voltage is applied across a conductor, the resistance restricts the flow of current, resulting in a decrease in the magnitude of the current. Materials with high resistance impede the flow of electricity more than materials with low resistance. The resistance of a component depends on factors such as its length, cross-sectional area, and the material it is made of.
Ohm’s law describes the relationship between current, voltage, and resistance. According to Ohm's Law, the current flowing through a circuit is directly proportional to the voltage across it and inversely proportional to the resistance of the circuit. Mathematically, this relationship is expressed as &lt;me&gt;I = V/R&lt;/me&gt;  where: &lt;ul marker=""&gt;
I is the the current in amperes
V is the voltage in volts, and 
R is the resistance in ohms (Ω). 
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
In other words, an increase in voltage leads to a corresponding increase in current if the resistance remains constant, while an increase in resistance results in a decrease in current for a given voltage.</Text>

Introduction
Although this ship is supplied with shipbuilder’s plans and manufacturer’s instruction books, there is no single document which gives guidance on operating complete systems as installed on board, as distinct from individual items of machinery.
The purpose of this ‘one-stop’ manual is to assist, inform and guide competent ship’s staff and trainees in the operation of the systems and equipment on board, and to provide additional information that may not be otherwise available. In some cases, the competent ship’s staff and trainees may be initially unfamiliar with this vessel and the information in this manual is intended to accelerate the familiarisation process.
It is intended to be used in conjunction with shipyard drawings and manufacturer’s instruction manuals, bulletins, Fleet Regulations, the ship’s Senior Officers Standing Orders, and in no way replaces or supersedes these publications, all of which take precedence over this manual.
Information relevant to the operation of this vessel has been carefully collated in relation to the systems of the vessel and is presented in three on-board volumes, a MACHINERY, DECK, BRIDGE and SOLAS OPERATING MANUALS.
The vessel is constructed to comply with MARPOL 73/78. These regulations can be found in the Consolidated Edition, 2017, and in the latest Amendments.
The information, procedures, specifications and illustrations in this manual have been compiled by WMT personnel by reference to shipyard drawings and manufacturer’s publications that were made available to WMT and believed to be correct at the time of publication. The systems and procedures have been verified as far as is practicable in conjunction with competent ship’s staff under operating conditions.
It is impossible to anticipate every circumstance that might involve a potential hazard, therefore, warnings and cautions used throughout this manual are provided to inform of perceived dangers to ship’s environment or equipment. In many cases, the best operating practice can only be learned by experience.
If any information in these manuals are believed to be inaccurate or incomplete, the officer must use his professional judgement and other information available on board to proceed.
Any such errors or omissions or modifications to the ship’s installations, set points, equipment or approved deviation from published operating procedures, must be reported immediately to the company’s Technical Operations Office, who should inform WMT so that a revised document may be issued to this ship and in some cases, others of the same class.

Safe Operation
The safety of the ship depends on the care and attention of all on board. Most safety precautions are a matter of common sense and good housekeeping and are detailed in the various manuals available on board. However, records show that even experienced operators sometimes neglect safety precautions through over-familiarity and the following basic rules must be remembered at all times.
• Never continue to operate any machine or equipment which appears to be potentially unsafe or dangerous and always report such a condition immediately.
• Make a point of testing all safety equipment and devices regularly. Always test safety trips before starting any equipment. In particular, overspeed trips on auxiliary turbines must be tested before putting the unit to work.
• Never ignore any unusual or suspicious circumstances, no matter how trivial. Small symptoms often appear before a major failure occurs.
• Never underestimate the fire hazard of hydrocarbon products, whether liquid or vapour.
• Never start a machine remotely from the cargo and engine control room without confirming visually that the machine is able to operate satisfactorily.
In the design of equipment, protection devices have been included to ensure that, as far as possible, in the event of a fault occurring, whether on the part of the equipment or the operator, the equipment concerned will cease to function without danger to personnel or damage to the machine. If any of these safety devices are bypassed, overridden or neglected, then the operation of any equipment or machinery in this condition is potentially dangerous.
Description
The concept of this manual is to provide information to technically competent ship’s officers, unfamiliar to the vessel, in a form that is readily comprehensible, thus aiding their understanding and knowledge of the specific vessel. Special attention is drawn to emergency safety and fire fighting systems.
The manual consists of a number of parts and sections which describe the systems and equipment fitted and their method of operation related to a schematic diagram where applicable.
The valves and fittings identifications and symbols used in this manual are the same as those used by the shipbuilder.

2.2 DIESEL GENERATORS
2.2.1 MAIN DIESEL GENERATOR ENGINES
Main Diesel Generator Engines
Introduction
The vessel is fitted with four main diesel generator engines (MGEs), each driving an alternator. The engines are of the four-stroke, trunk piston type, and are unidirectional with an operating speed of 900 rpm. There are eight cylinders in each bank. Constant pressure turbocharging is applied by means of one turbocharger per bank of cylinders, with the temperature of the scavenge air being reduced by a charge air cooler located between the turbocharger compressor, and the charge air manifold.
Cooling Water System
The cylinder jackets and cylinder heads are water cooled by means of circulating fresh water; the lower part of the cylinder liner is not cooled. The water jacket is fitted to the upper part of the liner where it projects above the engine block, which means that there are no cooling water passages in the cylinder block. Engine jacket and cylinder head cooling is provided by the High Temperature (HT) Fresh Water (FW) cooling system. Each engine is also provided with a separate Low Temperature (LT) FW cooling system which supplies for cooling of the LO and second stage charge air cooling. The engine HT cooling water system also supplies the initial cooling of the charge air. The HT circuit controls the water flow and temperature through the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) cooler, then to the engine frame and power assemblies. Engine-driven HT and LT cooling water circulating pumps operate whenever the engine is running, but electrically-driven HT and LT circulating pumps are also fitted, and circulate HT and LT cooling water systems. The HT cooling water system circulates via a preheater when the engine is stopped. The preheater uses an electric heat element to heat the HT cooling water system. The preheater allows an engine to be warmed-through before starting. The EGR cooler is mounted on the engine. It removes excess heat from the exhaust gas before it is recirculated into the combustion air, to assist the system to meet lower NOx emissions limits.
Lubricating Oil System
From the free-end cover, the engine Lubricating Oil (LO) header directs LO down both camshafts, which then feeds the main bearings. The LO enters the crankshaft from the main bearings, and flows through drilled passages in the shaft to the crank pins and rod bearings. The LO passes from the rod bearings through the connecting rods to lubricate the piston pins, and bushings. The LO then passes into the pistons to the chamber under the piston crown to cool the crown. The LO flows out of the piston crown through an orifice, through the piston skirt, and by gravity back to the crankcase.
LO is pumped throughout the engine through passages running the length of each camshaft. From there, it is fed through drilled passages in the crankcase up to the rocker arms and valves, and fed down to the crank shaft bearings and then to the pistons and cylinder liners through drilled passages in the crankshaft and connecting rods. The LO then flows by gravity back to the oil pan. The LO pump is mounted on the Integrated Forward-End (IFE) cover.
IMO No: 9910313 Produced by: WMT Limited, UK
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
The LO enters the camshaft sections. Radial holes in the journals supply oil to each of the bushings. The camshaft bushings contain annular grooves connecting to passages in the engine main frame, from where LO flows to the valve crossheads. The LO then flows upward through the valve push rods to supply LO to the valve train parts at the top of the cylinders. LO return is through the valve push rod cavities to lubricate the cams, cam rollers, and back to the crankcase by gravity.
The auxiliary drive gear is lubricated internally by LO flowing from a passage within the crankshaft through the gear hub. LO from these bearings returns by gravity to the crankcase. Turbocharger bearings receive LO through an internal passage in the top of the mounting brackets. From the turbocharger, the LO is returned to the crankcase through an internal passage in the mounting brackets, and through an external pipe bolted to the IFE.
LO is supplied to the barring-over gearbox by internal drilling in the main frame to the gearbox. The LO from the gearbox returns to the crankcase internally. The camshaft gears are splash lubricated through an orifice and pipe from the engine oil header. The oil pan bolted to the engine main frame forms the bottom of the crankcase, which holds the LO supply. The LO fill pipe is located on the side of the engine. Dipsticks for measuring the crankcase oil level are located on both sides of the frame.
Each engine is fitted with a centrifugal LO filter which is used to remove fine particles from the LO. The separator is supplied from the LO header tank. Inside the centrifuge, the LO is set into a centrifugal motion where contaminants in the LO are deposited on the walls of the rotor. LO then exits the centrifuge filter through a pair of nozzles on opposite sides of the oil filter base which transmits into a turning motion of the rotor.
The crankcase is fitted with seven crankcase explosion relief doors. These doors must be in good operational condition at all times, and no materials must be placed next to the doors that could impair their effective operation. The crankcase is also fitted with an oil mist detector, which monitors the oil mist concentration in the crankcase. By measuring the opacity of the atmosphere in the individual engine units, abnormal operating conditions such as overheating bearings and piston blow-by are detected. If abnormal oil mist concentrations are detected, the oil mist detector generates an alarm and the engine is shut down.

   WARNING
   If the engine has been shut down by the oil mist detector, the crankcase doors MUST NOT be opened until at least 20 minutes have elapsed after stopping of the engine in order to allow for cooling. If fresh air is allowed into the crankcase whilst a ‘Hot Spot’ still exists, there is a high risk that it will initiate a crankcase explosion.

Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
Excess fuel from the MGE fuel headers passes through the fuel regulating valve to the fuel tank. The MGE fuel cylinder returns on each side of the MGE collect excess fuel oil used to lubricate moving parts of the MGE fuel injection equipment, and directs it back to a gravity return tank or pump if required.
The filtration system consists of two filters separated by a hand-operated selector valve. When one filter starts tp clog up, which is indicated by the gradual drop in fuel flow, and header pressure, the hand valve located between the two filters should be turned to switch the flow from one filter to the other.
A pressure relief valve in the LP fuel system is integrated with the mechanical fuel pump. This valve is factory set to open at a pressure of 1,379 kPa (200 psi), and return bypassed fuel to the mechanical pump inlet. The valve protects the priming pump against electrical overload, and protects the system against excessive pressure caused by clogged filter elements, or fuel flow stoppage in the pressure side of the system. There is no maintenance needed for this item.
A pressure regulating valve is located after the LP fuel system pressure sensors, and before the HP fuel pump fuel metering valves. This valve is set to maintain the fuel header pressure of 700 to 900 kPa (102 to 131 psi).
Fuel Injection Equipment
The fuel injectors deliver atomized fuel into the cylinders. An integrated solenoid valve controls the timing, and duration of fuel injection. There is one injector in each cylinder head.
The fuel oil injector receives the fuel from the fuel injection pumps, and atomizes the fuel as it is delivered to the combustion chamber. The injector acts mainly as a valve.
The HPFP generates the pressure required for proper fuel injection. There are two high pressure fuel pumps, located on the left and right hand sides of the engine near the drive end of the MGE.
A pressure limiting valve is to the HP side of the system to protect against over pressurization. This valve will open, and divert excess fuel to the fuel gravity return tank whenever the pressure in the lines exceeds the design tolerances. It is located on the drive end of the engine, on the right hand side.
Fuel Oil Leak Detection
The HP common-rail fuel lines are double walled lines that carry fuel from the HPFPs to the injectors. The inner pipe is the primary fuel carrier from the HPFP to the injector. The outer pipe seals any leaking fuel from an inner pipeline failure or poor seal at either end of the fuel line.
Flexible fuel hoses collect, and carry any fuel leaking into the area between the inner and outer pipes of the HP fuel lines to the leakage collection tank. This tank contains a float switch, which when tripped sends a signal to sound an alarm in the monitoring system.

Crankshaft
The drive mechanism consists of the pistons, connecting rods, and crankshaft. The crankshaft connects mechanically to the alternator by a flywheel flange, and flexible plate. The pistons, connecting rods, and crankshaft are arranged in a slider-crank mechanism, which converts the work performed by the hot gases on the piston into torque on the crankshaft.
The crankshaft is suspended on main bearings in the engine crankcase. Counterweights ensure that the internal mass movements are reduced, thus relieving the stress on the crankshaft bearings. During the engine operation, the crankshaft rotates clockwise when viewed from the free end, and counter clockwise when viewed from the alternator end.
The crankshaft is a steel forging, normalized, and heat treated to improve its physical properties. The crankshaft main journals, and crankpins are of solid construction. Oil passages, drilled diagonally through the pins, intersect drilled passages in each adjacent main journal.
The forward end of the crankshaft is fitted with a flange to mount the vibration damper, and is located just ahead of the No. 1 main bearing. The pump drive gear is bolted to the same flange as the vibration damper. A semi-removable gear, mounted on the crankshaft just ahead of the alternator drive flange, drives the camshaft gears (through additional gearing).
Crankshaft Drive Gears
The crankshaft (alternator end) drives the camshaft through a gear train containing a crank gear mounted to the crankshaft, an idler gear set, and a camshaft gear mounted to the camshaft. On the free end, the crankshaft drives both the LO pump, and water pump through a gear bolted to the crankshaft.
Main Bearings
Semicircular main bearings support the crankshaft within the engine. The main bearings are secured by main bearing caps that are bolted in place. The main bearings are a precision type, and are replaceable without machining or scraping. Each bearing has a steel back which supports two or more layers of bearing material. The top main bearing halves have a center oil groove, and are used in the main frame bearing saddle. A partial grooved bearing is used in the lower main bearing position. The partial groove in the lower bearing results in a thicker film of oil, lower unit area loading, and higher LO header pressure. Each top main bearing half (with full oil groove) contains one locating tab which locates and secures the half in its correct position. Each lower bearing half (with partial groove) contains two locating tabs which prevent inadvertent installation in the upper position.
Cylinder Heads
The cylinder heads are manufactured from grey cast iron and are attached to the engine block by four hydraulically tensioned studs and nuts. Cooling water is
directed to the cylinder head from the engine block via the cylinder liner water cooling bores; this upward flow of water ensures there are no air pockets in the system and it keeps temperature gradients within acceptable limits. The water leaves the cylinder head through an outlet channel on the top and flows to a common pipe to the outlet connection for the jacket water High Temperature (HT) cooling water system. There is one inlet, exhaust, and fuel valve in each cylinder head.
Camshafts
The camshafts are rotated by the crankshaft through a system of gears with the gear drive arrangement being located at the drive end of the engine. The camshaft is built up of a number of sections that are joined together by bolted flanges. For each unit of the camshaft, there is one fuel injection cam, one air inlet valve cam and one exhaust valve cam. All of these cams have smooth profiles that allow for a controlled lifting and falling of the cam followers.
Turning Gear
An electric turning gear assembly is fitted at the flywheel of the engine. It is engaged manually from a lever on the turning gear housing, and has a manual adjusting handle below which can be used for fine adjustment to assist in engaging the gears. The turning gear is interlocked with the engine’s starting system so that the engine cannot be started while it is still engaged.
Fuel Oil System
The MGEs have Electronic Fuel Injection (EFI) systems, which comprise of a Low Pressure (LP) system (approximately 100 psi or 7 bar), and a High Pressure (HP) common rail fuel system (approximately 2,200 bar). The LP fuel system separates fine dirt from the fuel by means of two-stage particulate filtration. Fuel from the day tank flows to the water separator, then to the on-engine Low Pressure Fuel Pump (LPFP). From there it goes to a fuel cooler, and exits to the first-stage filter, which is mounted off-engine. From the first-stage filter, the fuel flows to the engine-mounted second-stage filter, and then flows to the High Pressure Fuel Pump (HPFP).
The LP suction section of the fuel system is between the fuel tank, and the MGE fuel pump. An automatic thermostatic blending valve is fitted to regulate fuel temperature before reaching the pump.
The HP section of the fuel system is between the MGE fuel pump, and the fuel injection equipment on the individual cylinders. The MGE fuel relief valve is integrated into the LP, on-engine fuel transfer pump, and protects the pump from overloading caused by flow restrictions on the HP portion of the fuel system. Fuel discharged by the pump flows through the two-stage MGE fuel filters. From the filter tank, fuel oil passes through the fuel pressure regulating valve, then to the high pressure fuel metering valve(s), and finally to the fuel injection equipment on the individual cylinders. The MGE fuel regulating valve maintains back pressure in the fuel headers for protecting the HP pumps from cavitation.

Starting Air System
Engine starting is by means of compressed air turning a starter motor. A solenoid and relay valve is placed after the regulator. The solenoid governs the starter to run or remain idle. The air then flows through the relay valve, and into the starter motor, cranking the engine until the controller signals the solenoid to disengage the starter pinion from the ring gear. In normal operations, the starter pinion disengages at 100 to 150 engine rpm. The air start system cranks the engine with a turbine type, engine mounted air starter. The air start system accepts a 24 VDC signal via a solenoid valve located on the on-engine mounted multi-valve/regulator. This solenoid can also be operated manually. The on-engine multi-valve also acts as a relay valve, strainer, and regulator. The multi-valve regulator is factory preset to 90 psi (6.3 bar).
Slow Turn
The slow turn facility is fitted to the engines to prevent possible damage occurring by starting engines with liquid present in a cylinder. Operation of the slow turn system is normally set to automatic, but an engine start may be made from the Local Control Panel (LCP) or remotely without slow start if necessary.
The IAMCS will monitor the availability of the diesel generators when set to standby, including the prelubrication and slow turning.
The master start air valve must not be closed when the engine is running. Turbochargers
The engine mounted turbochargers compress combustion air going into the cylinders using energy from the exhaust gases to perform the work. The turbochargers are mounted on the free end of the engine. For maximum efficiency and minimum emissions, the engine uses a sequential turbocharger arrangement. There are two low pressure turbochargers that feed into one high pressure turbocharger.
There is one LP turbocharger fitted to each bank of cylinders, and an HP turbocharger fitted centrally that can be run sequentially or bypassed. They operates on the constant pressure principle, where exhaust gas from all cylinders in the bank flows into large volume exhaust manifolds which then supply the turbocharger. The turbocharger is equipped with a single-stage axial flow exhaust gas turbine and a single-stage radial flow compressor. The turbine wheel and shaft form one part and the compressor impeller is fitted to the shaft.
The turbocharger casing is uncooled and the rotor has two radial bearing bushes located between the turbine disc and impeller. Lubricating oil is supplied to the bearings from the engine LO circulation system and it drains from the bearing area to the engine LO circulation tank. The main axial bearing consists of a free-floating thrust disc with profiles on both sides. Radial (rotor support) bearing bushes are secured in the housing with screws.

Air Filters and Coolers
Air Filter
There two air filters, and they are attached to the LP turbochargers. The air filters remove particles from the combustion air that might damage the engine.
Intercooler
There are two intercoolers used to cool the combustion air after it is compressed by the LP turbochargers. The intercoolers are cooled by the LT cooling circuit, and are mounted on the left and right hand sides on the free end of the engine.
Aftercooler
There is one aftercooler used to cool the combustion air after it is compressed by the HP turbocharger. The aftercooler is cooled by the LT cooling circuit and is mounted in between the intercoolers on the free end of the engine.
Exhaust Gas Separator
The exhaust gas separator is a small tank located on the left side of the engine, near the rear side of the LO cooler. It separates the after-cooler condensate from the intake air or exhaust gas combination that may escape with the condensate. The after-cooler condensate is drained out the bottom of the exhaust gas separator through a drain trap. The intake air or exhaust gas combination is vented to the exhaust stack through the top of the exhaust gas separator.
Exhaust Silencer
An exhaust silencer is fitted to reduce the noise level of the engine exhaust. The silencer is fitted with spark arrester.

2.2.2 DIESEL ENGINE CONTROL, MONITORING, AND SAFETY SYSTEM
Local Control Station (LCS)
The LCS is the interface with the engine operator. The LCS contains the CFD screen for operator interaction. Italso holds several indicator lights that indicate system status and various switches for engine control.
Emergency Stops
Multiple emergency stop connections are available for the ECS-4. When an emergency stop is triggered, an alarm will be displayed upon the CFD as the engine is shutting down. To reset from an emergency stop:
1) Determine and rectify the reason for the E-stop.
2) Place the emergency stop switch into normal operating position.
3) Pressing the ‘RESET’ button on the LCS resets the engine, and clearing the emergency stop condition.

Local Control Station
Reset Button
The reset pushbutton (8) is located on the front panel of the LCS. The button can be used to reset the control system, allowing the engine to restart after a shutdown or emergency stop has occurred. This reset can only be applied at the LCS, as typically a critical shutdown requires a thorough inspection of the equipment, and root cause of the shutdown determined and corrective action taken. To use the Reset Button, press and hold the button until the System OK LED illuminates (about three seconds). A softkey on the Consolidated Functional Display is also available on the Active Alarms screen.
Emergency Stop Pushbutton
The Emergency Stop pushbutton (9) is located on the LCS. This emergency stop can be used for immediate shutdown of the engine in the event of an emergency. Restarting the engine after an emergency stop will require a manual reset of the system.
System Power Switch
The System Power Switch (10) is located on the front of the LCS. This switch is used to turn power to the system ON or OFF
When turning the system off, the power supply will send a signal to the ECU and SFU, instructing these units to conduct a controlled bootdown. The controlled bootdown will allow the ECU and SFU to save information as required, and shut down safely, similar to a computer. When ready, the ECU and SFU will send a signal to the PSU, at which point the PSU will turn off its outputs to these units. This switch will also cause the Local CFD to go into a controlled bootdown. However, there is no interaction between the CFD and the PSU. The PSU will not reset until the switch is turned back to the ON position.

Introduction
GE
ECS-4 Engine Controller
The main function of the GE ECS-4 controller is to control engine speed under varying load conditions. Additional functions, such as engine protection and engine start/stop are also integrated into the controller. As a secondary function, the engine controller acts as an interface with off-engine equipment for engine related equipment.
Controller Components
Engine Control Unit (ECU)
The ECU is mounted on the engine. The ECU is responsible for engine speed control, maintenance of proper emissions levels, and required levels of protection. The ECU consists of several I/O circuit cards, contained in the enclosure mounted on the engine. Under normal operating circumstances, the engine operator will not have to interact with the ECU.
Safety Unit (SFU)
The SFU is mounted on the engine. The SFU performs monitoring of safety critical systems. As with the ECU, engine operators will not interact with the SFU on a regular basis.
Interconnect Box (ICB)
The ICB is designed to be off the engine, but must be within 10 metres of the engine. The ICB acts as a hub or junction box for on and off engine equipment. The ICB is field wired with glands or strain relief connectors. The ICB contains Ethernet switches for electronic communications. Once wired, the ICB will not require regular interaction with the engine operator.
Power Supply Unit (PSU)
The PSU is mounted off engine, but must be within 10 metres of the engine. The power supply provides the power required for the ECU, SFU, and other components. The PSU also monitors incoming and outgoing voltages, and sends an alarm to the Consolidated Function Display (CFD) when one is out of tolerance.

Start/Run/Stop Control Switch
The Start/Run/Stop switch (11) is located on the front of the LCS. This switch stops, starts, and allows the engine to run. Placing the switch in the ‘STOP’ position will stop the engine any time the engine is running, regardless of control location. Placing the engine in the ‘START’ position while in Local Control will allow engine starting, providing all start interlocks are met.
Local/Remote Control Switch
The Local/Remote control switch (12) allows the user to switch between local and remote control methods using a hard-wired switch on the LCS enclosure. Local control can be taken at any time from the LCS. Remote control requires acknowledgment.
Increase/Decrease Speed Switch
The Increase/Decrease Speed switch (13) is located on the LCS enclosure. This switch will increase or decrease the engine speed, on a consistent ramp rate, when the controller is in local mode.
Consolidated Functional Display (CFD)
The CFD (14) is located on the LCS. It is the operator interface for the engine, and the tool to monitor important engine operational parameters.
Interconnect Box
The ICB acts as a junction box for all on and off engine sensors and equipment. The ICB has dry contacts for signals that originate from the control system, and expects a dry contact from signals that originate from off-engine equipment. The ICB includes the necessary Ethernet switches for Modbus communications. There are no indications or other operational or troubleshooting information on or within the ICB.
Power Supply Unit
The PSU provides the necessary DC voltage for control system operation. The PSU is supplied by four separate 24VDC power feeds. Two power feeds are from a primary source (P1 and P2), and two are from a secondary source (S1 and S2). P1 and S1 provide power to the ECU converters; P2 and S2 provide power to the SFU, CFD, CAN Power, and control power converters. All power supply voltages are monitored to indicate a failure. The power supply should be protected by circuit breakers or fuses supplied by the vessel.
First Draft - May 2022 SSI / CUI:
Local/Remote Engine Operation
When in Local Mode, engine speed is controlled by the Increase/Decrease Speed switch on the LCS. The engine speed will ramp up or down in a consistent rate. The rate of speed increase and decrease is configurable. In Remote Mode, engine speed is controlled by either a 4-20mA throttle for variable speed engines, or a ±3VDC bias signal for constant speed engines. Similar to the local control, the speed will increase and decrease at a steady rate.
The transition from local mode to remote mode can happen from either the local station or a remote station.
To initiate Remote Control from the remote station, the operator at the remote station is to press and hold the ‘Remote Control Acknowledged’ button. After being pressed, the CFD at the LCS will alarm ‘Remote Control Requested’. At the LCS switches the operator then turns Local/Remote switch to ‘Remote’. The engine will now be in remote mode.
To initiate Remote Control from the LCS, the operator must put the Local/ Remote switch to ‘Remote’. The CFD will alarm ‘Local Station Requesting Remote Control’. The remote operator must then press the ‘Remote Control Acknowledged’ button. The engine will then be in remote mode.
The speed of the engine will not change until the speed signals match, i.e. the engine speed from the remote station will not change until it matches the current engine speed. This is to prevent inadvertent speed increase or decrease upon changing control stations.
To change from remote mode to local mode, the operator at the LCS moves the switch to ‘Local’. The engine control is then in local mode. Engine speed will not change.
Droop Mode of Engine Operation
Droop is intended to be used for synchronization purposes. Droop is available on both constant speed and variable speed applications. Operation is the same in both instances as the operator must switch the system from Isochronous Mode to Droop Mode. The engine will automatically increase or decrease speed according to the load. When synchronization is complete, the system must be returned Isochronous Mode to resume constant speed.
For constant speed engines, droop will only be available at Rated Speed. The amount of droop is calculated by the ECU, and is a product of engine speed, estimated load, and percent droop allowed. The less load on the engine, the higher the engine speed will increase. The amount of droop allowed is configurable between 0% and 6% of rated speed.

Engine Operation - Alarms, Alerts, and Messages
Alarms
Faults may be initiated by the control system or by other systems on the engine. When the control system detects a fault, a message describing the fault will appear in the alarm bar area on the CFD screen
.
The alarm can be silenced at any time from the CFD screen by pressing softkey F8 (Silence). Also, indication will be initiated by the ECS-4.
Types Of Alarms
There are two types of alarms present within the control system: Diagnostic Alarms and Engine Protection Alarms.
• Diagnostic Alarms are alarms for events such as wire loss, short circuit, communications failure, sensor out of range high or low, and power failures. These diagnostic alarms are not generally critical to the operation of the engine and system, but should be investigated and remedied at the first available opportunity.
• Engine Protection Alarms are alarms that are related to engine operational parameters. Faults within water, fuel, LO, and air systems are all engine protection alarms. Within Protection Alarms, several layers of protection exist.
• Warning: Warning alarms are informational and considered not critical to engine operation. The protective action should be investigated and repaired at the earliest opportunity.
• Slowdown Request: This is a request from the control system to reduce speed, and load on the engine. Possible conditions are high cooling or LO temperatures, and taking the corrective action may bring the parameter back to proper operating condition. This is not an automatic event.
• Speed Restriction: When this protective action occurs, the engine control system will automatically reduce the speed of the engine to protect the engine. This event is in response to a serious engine condition, and the cause of the alarm should be investigated quickly and repaired.
• Engine Load Limited: When this protective action occurs, the engine control system will automatically reduce the load on the engine to protect the engine. This event is in response to a serious engine condition, and the cause of the alarm should be investigated quickly and repaired.
• Shutdown: When this protective action occurs, the engine control system will automatically shut the engine down in response to a critical engine failure, such as engine overspeed or low LO pressure. Corrective action is to be taken prior to engine restart.

Operator Messages
Operator messages inform the operator of events that have occurred within the ECS-4 Control System. The highest priority message will be displayed on the CFD screen in the operator message bar just above the softkey indicators.
If more messages exist than can be displayed in the message box, the list of messages can be viewed on the CFD Messages screen.
Consolidated Functional Display (CFD) Controls
The CFD is the computer display portion of the GE T4 engine controller. The CFD provides the operator interface with the control system as operator commands from the CFD function softkeys are communicated to the system. Information on the CFD allows the operator to monitor engine performance. The CFD is integral to the Local Control Station. The following sections also apply to remote screens. On power-up, the CFD defaults to the Root Screen.
Each CFD keyboard contains two rows of softkeys:
• The first row contains eight function softkeys (F1 through F8) and the MENU softkey.
• The second row contains ten numeric softkeys (0 through 9).
The Menu Screen has limited softkeys available. A list and description are as follows:
a) Softkey F1 (Escape): Returns to the Root Screen. Note that no changes will be saved when pressing this button.
b) Softkey F2 (Page Up): Scrolls up through the pages of available alarms. This softkey will only display if there is an available page.
c) Softkey F8 (Silence): Silences all active alarms.
d) Softkey 2 (Page Down): Scrolls down through the pages of available screens. This softkey will only display if there is an available page.
e) Softkey 8 (Ack): Acknowledges all active alarms. Note that this softkey will only display when there is an alarm to acknowledge.
CFD Gauge Area
The gauge area of the CFD consists of the top one-quarter of the CFD screen. This gauge area is always shown on the CFD and provides an instant display of the engine status and RPM.
Gauge Area
• The Fuel Rate bar shows the percentage of fuel being supplied to the engine. This is a percentage of the total allowable fuel limit at the speed at which the engine is running. When the engine is fuel limited or load limited, the bar will flash yellow. Note that depending upon engine settings, fuel can be limited at less than 100% fuel.
• Overrides will only be visible when there is an overrideable event, depending upon engine configuration.
• The color and wording of ‘Engine Status’ will change depending upon the status of the engine. A display of ‘**’ indicates communication loss with ECU.
• ’Actual Speed’ is the actual speed of the engine as indicated by the control system.
• ‘Ref Speed’ is the reference speed from the customer, whether by analog or bias signal.

2.2.3 DIESEL GENERATOR ENGINE OPERATION Engine Operation
Each engine can be started and stopped from its own local control panel (LCP) or the ECR console. When set to local control, the engines cannot be started from the ECR.
The local control panels have illuminated START and STOP pushbuttons, which allow for local starting and stopping of the engines. In addition, there is a lamp test pushbutton, and illuminated indicators for ‘false start’, ‘start interlock’ and ‘control from remote control’. Two pushbuttons are provided for adjusting the engine speed, these are marked LOWER and RAISE.
The panels also have various pressure gauges, turbocharger and engine rpm gauges. A digital temperature scanner that can display temperature readings from sensors located on the engine is also provided.
Preparing a Main Generator Engine for Starting
1) Blowdown the air start receivers to ensure that water will not enter the air starter.
2) Ensure that the engine oil level is ‘FULL’.
3) Ensure that sufficient coolant water is present by verifying level in expansion tank sight glass.
4) Ensure that sufficient fuel for engine operation.
5) Prime the fuel system, if required.
6) Turn on any necessary vessel ventilation equipment.
7) Inspect the engine to ensure that no leaks or other signs of damage are present.
8) Ensure proper heating of engine cooling water, LO etc. Use HT Water and/or LO heater where applicable. It is recommended to manually shut off the heater once the engine has been started. The control system also contains a shutdown pre- heater as a backup.
9) Ensure that the engine has been pre-lubricated. If the engine has been pre-lubricated, the ‘Prelube Complete or Bypassed’ indication on the interlocks screen will be Green. The engine can only be started, if the pre-lubrication has been completed. To pre-lubricate the engine, press the ‘Start Prelube’ softkey on the Engine Control screen on the CFD.
First Draft - May 2022 SSI / CUI:
It is recommended that the pre-lubrication pump is manually shut down once the engine has started. As a backup, the pre-lubrication pump will automatically shut down when the engine is running.
To prevent damage to the pre-lubrication pump and/or heater pump, the control system will not allow both to be running at the same time. Starting of the pre-lubrication pump will cause the pre-heat signal from the ECU to shut off, and vice versa.
In an emergency situation only, pre-lubrication can be bypassed to start the engine quickly.
Starting the engine without proper pre-lubrication may result in engine damage and should be avoided when possible. Continuously starting the engine with pre-lubrication bypassed will damage the engine. Ensure that the pre-lubrication system is only bypassed in an emergency situation.
10) Investigate and correct any Start Interlock conditions. This can be done from the Start Interlock screen under the monitors menu of the CFD. Ensure that the following conditions are correct:
a) The engine is currently stopped.
b) The Bar Over Switch and switch door are closed.
c) The main breaker is open, and no other interlocks are present.
d) No stops are requested from any of the engine emergency stops or the Stop/Run/Start switch on the LCS.
e) Pre-lubrication is complete or has been bypassed. f) No active engine restrictions are present.
If the engine has been stopped for less than 8 hours (and there is no likelihood that water could have since gotten into the engine), blowdown can be bypassed and the following steps can be skipped.
11) Open the blowdown valves on all cylinders.
12) Enable blow down mode via the Engine Control screen from the CFD. When activated, the status indication onthe CFD screen will report ‘Blowdown’.
13) Turn and hold the Start/Run/Stop switch on the LCS to the start position. This will crank the engine via the airstart motor, but no fuel will be introduced. Allow the engine to crank, allowing for several engine rotations so that the air coming from the opened blow down valves is free of significant water vapor before releasing theswitch from the start position. This should take approximately 5 to 10 seconds.
IMO No: 9910313 Produced by: WMT Limited, UK
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
14) Close blowdown valves on all cylinders.
15) On the Engine Control screen on the CFD, return the blowdown switch to the OFF position.
16) Proceed to Start the engine.
Starting a Main Generator Engine
1) Ensure that all the pre-start steps have been completed before proceeding.
2) If starting at the LCS, turn and hold the Start/Run/Stop on the LCS in the Start position. This will crank the engine via the starter motor. Hold the switch in the start position until the engine fuel system can support the engine running. This should occur between 50 and 175 rpm.
3) If starting from a remote location via Modbus, enable the Engine Start Modbus signal through the remote CFD. The Modbus signal will crank the engine via the starter motor until the fuel system can support an engine run.
4) If starting from a remote location via a digital hardwired signal, hold the switch or signal in the same fashion asthe Start/Run/ Stop switch on the LCS.
5) Perform a visual inspection of the engine for any fluid, air, or exhaust leaks.
6) Perform a visual inspection of all operating temperatures and pressures to ensure that the coolant, and LO systems are performing as expected.
7) After the engine starts, there is a period of time in which the engine calibrates the EGR system, and the valves that regulate engine emissions. During this time, which takes approximately three minutes, the operator will hear different tones, and sounds from the engine, as not all cylinders fire, and various pressures within the system change. All of this activity is normal. This period of time is known as system calibration, and happens every time the engine is started.

During system calibration, a message will appear on the CFD screen that reads ‘EGR System Calibration Active’. This message is intended for the engine operator to know when the engine is doing its system calibration, as well as when the test is over.
Engine speed will not change during the system calibration time, however, the control system will note engine speed change requests. After system calibration, the engine will respond to previously entered speed commands, possibly causing an unintended speed change. It is NOT recommended trying to adjust engine speed until after system calibration is over.
Running a Main Generator Engine
After an engine start, allow sufficient time for the engine to come to steady state conditions prior to loading or increasing speed to rated. Ensure periodic checks are made of the engine, and operating parameters to ensure there are no leaks or other abnormal operating conditions. If running the engine at the following conditions for extended periods of time:
• At rated speed (i.e. 900 or 1,000 rpm), and low HP (20% and less).
• Idling (350 to 440 rpm) with no load (0% to 5% HP) with de-clutched main engines or disconnected generator.
It is recommended that:
• The engine is run a maximum of 8 hours of continuous operation
• The engine is loaded every 8 operating hours to a minimum of 70% of the rated output for 30 minutes.
Controlling a Running Constant Speed Engine
Constant speed engines can be controlled from either a local station or a remote station. The methods of speed control from both are as below:
Control from LCS
a) Ensure that the CFD Screen is configured for operation in local mode.
• If the CFD screen is configured for operation in local mode, continue to the next step.
• If the CFD screen is not configured for operation in local mode, place the Local/Remote switch to the Local position.
b) Use the Increase/Decrease Switch to bring engine speed up to Rated or down to Idle as required. When the engine speed is close to the Rated or Idle setting, it will recognize the Rated or Idle setpoint and maintain that speed.
Control from Remote Station
a) Ensure that the CFD screen is configured for operation in remote mode.
• If the CFD screen is configured for operation in remote mode, continue to the next step.
b) If the system is configured to use Ethernet controls, Idle/Rated can be controlled via Modbus. The way this is accomplished depends upon system configuration.
c) If the system uses hardwired digital signals, Idle/Rated is controlled through digital input.
d) The remote station should use a ±3VDC bias signal to fine-tune engine speed. The rate of bias speed adjustment is configurable in the system.
Stopping a Main Generator Engine
To stop the engine under non-emergency situations, turn the Start/Run/Stop switch on the LCS to the Stop position. Alternatively, engine stop can be carried out from remote locations via Modbus or digital hardwired signal, depending upon system configuration. This will slowly reduce the engine’s reference speed until the engine comes to a stop.
Override
Some applications will allow for the use of override of engine protective actions. If General Override is utilized in an application, then protective actions for Speed Restriction, Engine Load Limited, and Shutdown can be individually configured for Override. When Override is enabled, and a protective event with Override configured occurs, the operator has a set time to engage the override to prevent the protective action. If the override is not engaged within the time frame, the action occurs. When the override is released, the protective action will occur if the condition still exists. Override should be controlled by a maintain-style push button or switch where the operator has access to it under normal operating conditions.
The Oil Mist Detector shutdown event may also be configured for Shutdown Override. Note that a second separate button must be utilized for this override. When an Override is available, indication will be made on the Gauge Panel area of the CFD.

Exhaust Gas Recirculation
Diesel Engine Emissions Control System
The Exhaust Gas Recirculation system (EGR) works by returning a small portion of exhaust gas to the engine’s combustion chambers through the intake manifold, lowering combustion temperatures, and therefore reducing the amount of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emitted. This process leads to a significant reduction in NOx emissions because it reduces the two elements underlying its production, excess oxygen, and combustion temperature. The EGR valve is the main component of the EGR system, and is normally closed.
The EGR system in engage on arrival into an Emissions Control Area (ECA), and disengaged on leaving an ECA.
Main Components of The EGR System
EGR Cooler
The EGR cooler removes excess heat from exhaust gas before it is recirculated into the combustion air. The cooling water for the EGR cooler is supplied by the HT cooling circuit. Sulphuric acid condensate is produced in the EGR cooler, and is drained away to a receiving tank. Additionally, the HT vent connection for air removal is also connected to the EGR cooler. Vent piping runs from the HT side of the EGR cooler to the HT expansion tank.
NOx Sensor
The NOx sensor is a CAN based digital sensor that senses the NOx concentration of the MGE exhaust gas. This sensor is located on the right side LP turbocharger exhaust outlet

2.2.4 Engine
EMERGENCY DIESEL GENERATOR
Engine Control Panel (ECP)
The ECP is an Auto Maksin C Command Elite Plus, this consists of a Customer Interface Box (CIB) which is mounted on the generator set skid. There is a power ON/OFF switch, and an EMEGENCY STOP switch mounted on the front panel of the CIB. Mounted in the upper part of the front panel is a DCU 410E Engine Control Unit (ECU). The ECU provides all the functions of operating the emergency generator.
The C-Command Elite Plus control panel consists of the following units:
• DCU 410E, engine control unit (ECU).
• SDU-410, Safety unit (shut down unit SDU).
• RIO-410, Remote input/output unit (RIO).
The DCU 410E has a color touch screen, this is divided up into three sections
At the top is a status bar, this indicated the present status of the generator and any alarms that are extant. The central part is the main screen area. At the bottom of the screen is soft button bar, the soft buttons will have different function depending upon which display has been selected, for example, the MODE soft button will bring up a mode selection screen and the mode of operation can be chosen from there. The generator engine START and STOP switches can be either latched or unlatched, when latched all that is needed is a single push of the soft switch to start or stop the engine, in the unlatched position the START and STOP switches have to be held down until the engine either starts or stops (it is usual to have the Start and Stop switches unlatched).

Digital Gauge Panel (GP)
A digital gauge panel displays engine data. The gauges are installed in a panel mountable frame.
The Gauge Panel consists of the following gauges:
• Tachometer (with Mini display).
• Engine LO pressure.
• Engine coolant temperature.
• System voltage.
• Exhaust stack temperature - right.
• Exhaust stack temperature – left.
• Gear oil pressure.
The mini-display contained in the tachometer allows to view the available engine parameter data in text format. This list of parameters goes beyond the values represented by the gauges. Also, in the event of a fault condition, the mini-display will indicate that active alarms are present, and a buzzer will sound. Each of the active faults will then be available with full text description including the appropriate Cummins Fault Code number.
The individual gauges in this panel indicate a Red alarm fault condition with a Red indicator lamp within the gauge face. This lamp will be in addition to the alarm buzzer, and text description of the fault in the tachometer’s mini-display.

Control Panel (CP)
The Control Panel is fitted to allow for remote engine control functions. This panel is designed to be flush mounted into a helm console.
The CP includes the same features as the ERP control panel for the main system with regard to Start, Stop, Alarm Acknowledge, and Alarm Indication. The differences are with the Power and Local Start. These features are described below.
Local Start Only Lamp
This yellow lamp illuminates when the ‘Local Start Only’ function is activated in the ERP. When the lamp is illuminated, the Start button will not function. The Stop button will function normally when Local Start Only is active.
Power Lamp
This green lamp is illuminated when the CP has power. The power to the CP is controlled by the Power switch on the CIB.
Digital Display (ED-3)
The ED-3 gray scale Digital Display can be used at any remote station that requires engine data to be displayed. It is able to display engine data in both text and graphical formats. In addition, the display is capable of showing the active and historical fault codes present during operation.
Prepare the Emergency Diesel Engine for Automatic Starting
The normal method of starting is by electric battery starting. Three attempts are made, and if this fails it will attempt to start with the hydraulic starter.
a) Ensure that the control panel power source switch is turned to the ON position.
b) Check that the engine operating mode is AUTO; it should normally be in the AUTO position unless testing.
c) Check the level of LO in the engine sump using the dipstick and top-up as necessary with the correct grade of oil.
• Only check the LO level after the engine has been switched off for a minimum of 10 minutes to ensure that the LO has settled after the operating period.
d) Check the level of coolant in the radiator and top-up as necessary with a 50/50 antifreeze/clean distilled water mixture.
First Draft - May 2022 SSI / CUI:
e) Check the level of MGO in the emergency generator MGO storage tank and top-up as required.
f) If the coolant heater is not switched on, switch it on and allow the engine to warm-up.
• The coolant heater is normally left switched on when the engine is stopped and will cut-in and cut-out to maintain the coolant temperature.
g) Open the fuel oil supply quick-closing valve from the MGO storage tank to the diesel engine.
• It is normally left in the open position when the engine is stopped, which allows the engine to start immediately when required.
The emergency diesel generator is now ready for operation and it will start automatically and supply power when the emergency bus no-voltage is detected. In the event of loss of power from the main electrical supply, after the emergency generator has established a voltage, the emergency Air Circuit-Breaker (ACB) automatically closes to supply power to all consumers connected to the emergency switchboard.

cooling load and the sea water temperature. When the sea water temperature is 25°C (77°F) or above, two sea water pumps should be used.
CAUTION
The use of No.1+4 main cooling sea water pumps for bilge pumping is an emergency procedure and should only be undertaken in circumstances
when the stability and safety of the vessel are in danger.
The sea water system is protected by an anti-fouling Marine Growth Prevention System (MGPS) which uses an electrolytic system with copper and aluminium electrodes fed with an impressed current. The high amd low sea suction strainers have their own MGPS with the electrodes being built into the strainer lids.
The two main LT fresh water coolers each have a capacity of 100%, and normally one is in operation. Each cooler is fitted with an internal filter which is used to trap debris from flowing into the passageways, the filter cage is accessed by a plate built onto the strong back. The coolers are also provided with backflushing valves which can be operated as required to remove debris from the heat exchanger surfaces, in doing so they help to maintain the cooler’s efficiency. The backflushing interval is determined by an increase in the pressure drop across the cooler as recorded in the engine room log, this will indicate fouling, and cleaning of the cooler will be necessary.
Procedure for Setting No.1 Main Sea Water Suction Crossover
a) Ensure that both suction strainers are clear.
b) Ensure all the pressure gauge and instrumentation valves are open and that the instrumentation is reading correctly.
c) Set up the valves as shown in the table below to the open position. In this case the port high suction is to be used:

This part of the section describes Engine Room 1 sea water system.
The low suction sea chest is located on the starboard side of engine room 1, with the high suction sea chest located on the port side. Sea water enters the crossover main via large high capacity strainers. Engine room 1 crossover main supplies main sea water cooling pumps No.1, 2 and 3. The high suction is used to prevent any debris eg, sand, silt etc, found in shallow waters from entering the system. Both sea chests include drain and vent holes, and are fitted with connections to supply working air for sea chest weed cleaning, and a recirculation valve from the HT and LT fresh water sea water cooling overboard line for de-icing.
Engine room 1 crossover main arrangement allows all three of the sea water cooling pumps to be supplied from either side of the vessel via the high or low sea chests and strainers. The three pumps have the same rating and discharge capacity. No.1 sea water cooling pump is fitted with suction air ejector priming unit that allows the pump to be used as an emergency bilge pump to clear water from the engine room in the event of flooding.
The cooling sea water pumps are rated at 100% of total capacity (two working, one on standby), therefore in normal operations the main cooling sea water pumps can either be started and stopped locally, or selected for remote operation. When selected for remote operation, one or two cooling sea water pumps would be selected as the duty pump(s) and the other pump selected for automatic operation in standby mode; the standby pump would start if the duty pump(s) could not maintain the required pressure. A pressure switch located on the discharge manifold provides the start signal for the standby pumps. The number of cooling sea water pumps required to operate depends upon the

d) Select the duty and the standby pumps, set the switches on the group starter panels on the main switchboard for these pumps to the REMOTE position. At the control panel, start the first duty pump.
e) Ensure that the selected operational pump delivers sea water at the correct pressure to the outlet manifold; if the system operation is satisfactory, start a second duty pump as required according to the cooling load and sea water temperature. Set the standby pump at the control panel. This standby pump will cut-in on low manifold pressure.
f) Operate the sea water systems as required. The above illustration shows No.1 and No.2 MGEs are running with both LT and HT coolers in use, and one LT FW cooler in use.
Backflushing the Central Fresh Water Cooler
Each FW cooler is designed to take 100% of the cooling load at maximum capacity from the plant, with a margin for overload and fouling. Heavy fouling is identified by a large pressure drop across the cooler sea water system. Backflushing of a cooler should be undertaken before the fouling produces a significant deterioration in cooler performance. The cooler is still operational during backflushing, as sea water is flowing through the cooler. A basket filter is fitted at the inlet to each cooler and this should be manually cleaned when the opportunity presents itself in order to ensure that the cooler remains in good operating condition. In order to clean the filter basket it is necessary to isolate the cooler and drain the sea water side of the cooler into the bilges.

2.3.2 AUXILIARY MACHINERY ROOMS 1+2 AND BOW THRUSTER ROOM SEA WATER COOLING SYSTEM
Auxiliary Sea Water Cooling Pumps No.1, 2
Introduction
The sea water cooling system is divided into the following sections:
• Engine Room 1.
• Engine Room 2.
• Auxiliary Machinery Rooms 1 and 2 + Bow Thruster Room.
• Auxiliary Machinery Rooms 3 and 4.
• Motor Room 2.
This part of the section describes auxiliary machinery rooms 1 and 2 + bow thruster room sea water system.
The low suction sea chest is located on the starboard side of auxiliary machinery room 2, with the high suction sea chest located on the port side. Sea water enters the crossover main via large high capacity strainers. Auxiliary machinery room 2 crossover main supplies auxiliary sea water cooling pumps No.1+2, No.1 bilge/auxiliary sea water cooling pumps No.1, and No.1 Freshwater Generator (FWG) feed pump. The high suction is used to prevent any debris eg, sand, silt etc, found in shallow waters from entering the system. Both sea chests include drain and vent holes, and are fitted with connections to supply working air for sea chest weed cleaning.
Auxiliary machinery room 2 crossover main arrangement allows all three of the auxiliary sea water cooling pumps, and No.1 FWG feed pump to be supplied from either side of the vessel via the high or low sea chests and strainers. No.1+2 auxiliary sea water cooling pumps have the same rating and discharge capacity. No.1 bilge/auxiliary sea water cooling pump has an additional capacity rating when used as a bilge pump. This pump has a connection to the bilge system.
The auxiliary cooling sea water pumps are rated at 100% of total capacity (two working, one on standby), therefore in normal operations the auxiliary cooling sea water pumps can either be started and stopped locally, or selected for remote operation. When selected for remote operation, one or two cooling sea water pumps would be selected as the duty pump(s) and the other pump selected for automatic operation in standby mode; the standby pump would start if the duty pump(s) could not maintain the required pressure. A pressure switch located on the discharge manifold provides the start signal for the standby pumps. The number of cooling sea water pumps required to operate depends upon the cooling load and the sea water temperature. When the sea water temperature is 25°C (77°F) or above, two sea water pumps should be used.
IMO No: 9910313 Produced by: WMT Limited, UK
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
The sea water system is protected by an anti-fouling MGPS which uses an electrolytic system with copper and aluminium electrodes fed with an impressed current. The high amd low sea suction strainers have their own MGPS with the electrodes being built into the strainer lids.
The bow thruster fresh water cooler has a capacity of 100%. The cooler is fitted with an internal filter which is used to trap debris from flowing into the passageways, the filter cage is accessed by a plate built onto the strong back. The cooler is provided with backflushing valves which can be operated as required to remove debris from the heat exchanger surfaces, in doing so they help to maintain the cooler’s efficiency. The backflushing interval is determined by an increase in the pressure drop across the cooler as recorded in the engine room log, this will indicate fouling, and cleaning of the cooler will be necessary.
Procedure for Setting No.2 Auxiliary Machinery Room Sea Water Suction Crossover
a) Ensure that both suction strainers are clear.
b) Ensure all the pressure gauge and instrumentation valves are open and that the instrumentation is reading correctly.
c) Set up the valves as shown in the table below to the open position. In this case the port high suction is to be used:

2.3.3 AUXILIARY MACHINERY ROOMS 3+4 SEA WATER COOLING SYSTEM
Auxiliary Sea Water Cooling Pumps No.3, 4
The low suction sea chest is located on the starboard side of auxiliary machinery room 3, with the high suction sea chest located on the port side. Sea water enters the crossover main via large high capacity strainers. Auxiliary machinery room 3 crossover main supplies auxiliary sea water cooling pumps No.3+4, No.2 bilge/auxiliary sea water cooling pumps No.2, and No.2 Freshwater Generator (FWG) feed pump. The high suction is used to prevent any debris eg, sand, silt etc, found in shallow waters from entering the system. Both sea chests include drain and vent holes, and are fitted with connections to supply working air for sea chest weed cleaning.
Auxiliary machinery room 3 crossover main arrangement allows all three of the auxiliary sea water cooling pumps, and No.2 FWG feed pump to be supplied from either side of the vessel via the high or low sea chests and strainers. No.3+4 auxiliary sea water cooling pumps have the same rating and discharge capacity. No.2 bilge/auxiliary sea water cooling pump has an additional capacity rating when used as a bilge pump. This pump has a connecntion to the bilge system.
The auxiliary cooling sea water pumps are rated at 100% of total capacity (two working, one on standby), therefore in normal operations the auxiliary cooling sea water pumps can either be started and stopped locally, or selected for remote operation. When selected for remote operation, one or two cooling sea water pumps would be selected as the duty pump(s) and the other pump selected for automatic operation in standby mode; the standby pump would start if the duty pump(s) could not maintain the required pressure. A pressure switch located on the discharge manifold provides the start signal for the standby pumps. The number of cooling sea water pumps required to operate depends upon the cooling load and the sea water temperature. When the sea water temperature is 25°C (77°F) or above, two sea water pumps should be used.
CAUTION
The use of No.2 bilge/auxiliary cooling sea water pump for bilge pumping is an emergency procedure and should only be undertaken in
circumstances when the stability and safety of the vessel are in danger.
The sea water system is protected by an anti-fouling MGPS which uses an electrolytic system with copper and aluminium electrodes fed with an

engine room 2. These generator pairs (No.1/No.2 and No.3/No.4) have HT and LT cooling circuits covering the pair. In order to fulfil the SRtP requirements, there are two independent LT fresh water cooling systems, one serving engine room 1 and one serving engine room 2. Each MGE LT cooling circuit deals with its associated engine pair, and also the associated propulsion system for engine room 1, and the other in engine room 2.
Each LT cooling system is self-contained and not linked to any other cooling system, apart from at the heat exchangers within the system. Each LT cooling system has its own header/expansion tank which is replenished from the distilled water system. The header/expansion tank allows for thermal expansion of the water in each LT system as well as providing for make-up and maintaining a pressure head. The tank is replenished from the distilled water system. The expansion tank valve to the system is normally locked open.
Each MGE HT circuit has its own header/expansion tank which has a local gauge glass, level transmitter for indication at the CAMS, and a low level alarm. The header tanks can be manually topped-up from the distilled water system. Chemical treatment can be added to the header tank as required.
A further separate system is for cooling of the bow thruster motor, and rexpeller. This system is a self contained LT cooling system, with the LT cooler being cooled by sea water from the auxiliary machinery room 1,
In the event of a blackout, the selected duty LT cooling fresh water pump in each circuit will start automatically on restoration of electrical power. The LT circulating water temperature is controlled to xx°C at the pump suction by three-way temperature controlled valves at the outlet from each LT system cooler which provides for cooler bypass as necessary. Each LT cooler is sized to provide for 100% of the maximum cooling load on each circuit, so only one cooler is per cooling system at any time. Duty coolers should be changed over at frequent intervals so that both coolers have approximately the same running

hours. The same changeover routine should apply to the LT cooling fresh water pumps.
Each LT FW cooler has a three-way outlet valve which is controlled through the CAMS, and operates to maintain the LT cooler outlet temperature to give a pump suction temperature of xx°C/°F. An alarm is raised if the cooler outlet temperature rises above xx°C/°F.
The HT cooling water system provides for cooling of the HT cooling water circuit, but the main means of cooling the HT water is by the distilled water generator (DWG), and/or the heat recovery system (HVAC).
In addition to the MGEs, each MGE LT system also supplies cooling to a number of propulsion services, including the associated propulsion cooling systems. Further consumers in each system include associated propulsion transformers, frequency converters, braking resistors, and shaft line support systems.
Corrosion inhibiting treatment chemicals are added to the LT circulating water of each engine by means of a pump at the water treatment unit. It is important that the circulating fresh water is analysed frequently and treatment chemicals added as necessary in order to prevent corrosion in the circulation system.
Procedure for Setting up and Operating the Main Diesel Generator Engine Low Temperature Cooling Fresh Water Systems
The MGE LT fresh water (FW) cooling systems are similar for each engine pair. The procedure below applies to both circuits. This description assumes that the MGE sea water cooling systems are operational:
a) Ensure that all pressure gauge and instrumentation valves/cocks are open, that all instruments are reading correctly and control systems are operational.
b) Ensure that the MGE LT FW cooling systems are fully charged and that the cooling fresh water in the system is correctly treated to prevent corrosion; analyse a water sample and, if necessary, add treatment chemicals.
c) Ensure that the MGEs sea water cooling systems are operational, and that sea water is circulating through the operating LT FW coolers in each cooling system.

d) Set the valves as in the following table; internal engine valve numbers are not shown for individual engines. Valves are to be set as indicated unless an engine has been shut down for maintenance and the power management system configured so that the engine cannot be started. Unless specified, all other valves including line drain valves must be closed.

2.4.2 GENERATOR ENGINES 1+2+3+4 HT FRESH WATER COOLING SYSTEM
HT Fresh Water Coolers for GE Jacket Cooling
Each MGE pair has the following separate HT cooling water circuits:
• HT fresh water coolers No.1, 2 in engine room 1, and HT fresh water coolers No.3, 4 in engine room 2.
• HVAC water heater No.1 in engine room 1, and HVAC water heater No.2 in engine room 2 (glycol/water circulation).
• DWG is in engine room 1 only.
Engine Room 1+2 HT Fresh Water Cooling System
HT Fresh Water Coolers for Main Generator Engines Jacket Cooling
These coolers are for cooling MGEs No.1 ~ 4 jacket water systems, and are in turn cooled by the sea water cooling system. Valves are normally left in the open position so that the system may operate at any time as required.
HVAC Water Heater
The HVAC water heater recovers heat from the MGE HT cooling water systems, and uses it to provide heating for the HVAC hot water circulation system. The heat from the MGE HT cooling water heats up the glycol/ water circulating through the HVAC water heater, and circulates through accommodation Air Handling Units (AHUs), and various air conditioning Fan Coil Units (FCUs) on the vessel. Circulation of the glycol/water is carried out by hot water circulating pumps, with two pumps in each circuit.
Distilled Water Generator
One Distilled Water Generator (DWG) capable of producing 10 ton of distilled water per day, utilises the MGE HT jacket water cooling system as its heat source, and is located in engine room 1. HT water from the MGEs in engine room 1 is directed to the DWG, but if that is shut down or there is more heat than required by the DWG, the temperature in the MGE HT cooling water is maintained by the three-way temperature control valve HF015.
Procedure for Setting up and Operating the Main Diesel Generator Engine High Temperature Cooling Fresh Water Systems
The MGE HT FW cooling systems are similar for each engine pair. The procedure below applies to both circuits. This description assumes that the MGE sea water cooling, and glycol/water systems are operational:
a) Ensure that all pressure gauge and instrumentation valves/cocks are open, that all instruments are reading correctly and control systems are operational.
b) Ensure that the MGE HT FW cooling systems are fully charged, and that the cooling fresh water in the system is correctly treated
IMO No: xxxxxxx
Produced by: WMT Limited, UK Email: manuals@wmtmarine.com
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
to prevent corrosion; analyse a water sample and, if necessary, add treatment chemicals.
c) Ensure that the MGEs sea water cooling systems are operational, and that sea water is circulating through the operating HT FW coolers in each cooling system.
d) Ensure that the HVACs glycol/water systems are operational.
e) Set the valves as in the following table; internal engine valve numbers are not shown for individual engines. Valves are to be set as indicated unless an engine has been shut down for maintenance and the power management system configured so that the engine cannot be started. Unless specified, all other valves including line drain valves must be closed.

2.5 COMPRESSED AIR SYSTEMS 2.5.1 STARTING AIR SYSTEM
Starting Air Compressors
A high temperature sensor is located at the compressor outlet, and this will trip the compressor if the temperature exceeds a predetermined limit.
Each starting air compressor has an automatic unloading arrangement which operates when the compressor starts and stops. This allows the compressor to start and stop off-load, thus reducing the load on the electric motor, and the compressor running gear. The compressors are started and stopped by pressure switches located on the inlet line to the starting air receivers, one switch for each compressor.
Starting air is supplied to the MGEs from the starting air receivers. Normally, one air receiver is designated as the duty air receiver, and the other is fully pressurised with its outlet valves closed when at sea.
The two main valves on each air receiver are designated as follows:
• Outlet to the MGEs.
• Inlet from the starting air compressors.
Switches at the local starter panels enable the compressors to be manually started and stopped. Each compressor has a pressure switch connected to the control system which allows for auto start/stop and manual start/auto stop. The compressors are selected for automatic operation at the selector switch, with one compressor being selected as the lead compressor and the others as the follow-on. The lead compressor will start first to maintain the pressure in the starting air receivers, but if the pressure continues to fall, the follow-on compressor will start as required.
The selected lead compressor should be changed periodically in order to arrange the running hours on the compressors to suit maintenance requirements. The lead and follow-on compressor are selected at each engine control console mode switch in the ECR.
The auxiliary consumers are supplied by the control/service air compressors, and the supply from the starting air receivers is available as a back-up.
Procedure for Operating the Starting Air Receivers

Each MGE pair has its own indepedent starting air system comprising of two starting air compressors, and two starting air receivers. There is a cross connection between the starting air systems for each of the MGE pairs should a failure occur with one starting air system.
Each starting air system is supplied by two main air compressors which provide air to the two starting air receivers. The compressed air is used to start the MGEs. Compressed air from the main 30 bar (435psi) system can, when required, supply the working air and control air systems via the 30 ~ 8 bar air reducing stations.
The starting air receivers are supplied through an oil/water separator located on each discharge from the main air compressors. Each compressor is fitted with two safety valves, one after the first stage and the other after the second stage. The cylinder block cooling water jacket is provided with a safety valve which will operate if the cooling water system is subjected to excessive pressure. Cooling water is supplied by the low temperature (LT) cooling fresh water (FW) system.
A pressure switch connected to the automatic control system stops the compressor should the LO pressure fall below a predetermined value. The bearings are lubricated by a main shaft driven gear pump.

f) Check that all automatic drain traps are operational and that the unloader gear is functioning.
g) Check that the starting air receiver automatic drains are functioning correctly, and the compressor automatic drains are functioning correctly.
h) Select the air compressors for lead and follow-on duty as required. The lead and follow-on compressor are selected at each engine control console mode switch in the ECR.
i) Drain any liquid from the receivers and oil/water separator.
j) Observe the system for any leaks and remedy as necessary.
The running compressor will operate and supply air to the starting air receivers. Under normal operating conditions, only one air receiver would be in use at any time, with the second receiver fully charged and isolated, but under certain circumstances, both might be opened to ensure that adequate air at the correct pressure is available to meet demand.
The duty engineer needs to assess the rate at which compressed air is being used, and the rate at which the receivers are being replenished.
The starting air receiver high pressure air supply to the control air and service air systems is reduced from 30 bar (435psi) to a working pressure of 8 bar (116psi), the supply to the service air system is only for back-up purposes.
On completion of the valve line-up, the initial start-up of the system will be from a dead ship condition.
When electrical power is established on the main switchboard, the necessary auxiliary systems can be brought into operation, ie, cooling water and fuel, the starting air receivers can be brought up to full charge, and the control air and service air system put into operation.

Back-up Air Supply for Control and Working Air Systems
There are back-up supply valves from the starting air system to the associated working and control air systems which are normally maintained in the closed position. However, these valves should be operated (opened and closed) once each month to ensure that they remain in operating condition at all times. They are normally only used in an emergency when the associated working/ control air compressor/receiver system cannot operate. It is essential that the back-up facility from the associated starting air system is available in such circumstances.

2.5.2 CONTROL AIR SYSTEM Control Air Compressors
On leaving the acoustic cabinet, the compressed air enters the respective control air receiver. These air receivers have a capacity of 1m3 and are fitted with a low pressure alarm that operates through the CAMS. On the discharge side of the receivers is a refrigerant type air dryer, and a network of pipes that supply the instruments and controllers that need compressed air to operate.
Control air should always be supplied to the end users via the dryers to ensure any entrapped moisture is removed. Moisture in the air can, over a period of time, cause damage to the inside of the control devices, and may result in the devices becoming inoperative, therefore, the dryer should only ever be bypassed in an emergency, and then for as short a period of time as possible. If the dryer is bypassed for any reason, the air lines must be blown through with dry-air as soon as they are operational again.
Control Air Dryers
One control air dryer is fitted downstream of the control air reservoir. The incoming air passes into the dryer, and is cooled by an internal refrigeration system, which primarily comprises an hermetically sealed compressor, a condenser and a water separator filter dryer unit. When the compressor is switched on and running, the temperature of the incoming air is reduced to the dew point temperature which causes any moisture in the air to condense. The condensate is then separated from the air in the moisture separator and is discharged through an auto drain outlet. The evaporated refrigerant is returned to the inlet of the compressor where it compressed again and discharged to the condenser. Here the refrigerant gas is converted to liquid and circulated around the system, allowing the cycle to start again.
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
Although the control air passes through a dryer, it is important that the operator checks the control air pipe system for the presence of water at frequent intervals and drains any water which is present.
Back-up Air Supply for Control Air System
There is a back-up supply valve system from the starting air system to the control air system which is normally maintained in the closed position. However, these valves should be operated (opened and closed) once each month to ensure that they remain in operating condition at all times. They are normally only used in an emergency when the associated control air compressor/receiver system cannot operate. It is essential that the back-up facility from the associated starting air system is available in such circumstances.

Procedure for Operating the Control Air System Engine Room 1
a) It is assumed that the control air system is operational.
b) Set the control air system valves as in the following tables.
All valves are prefixed ‘TA’ unless otherwise stated.
There are two air systems for the production of control air. No.1 system is located in engine room 1, and No.2 system is located in engine room 2. The two systems operate independently from each other, but can be cross-connected by opening valves LA011 and LA211 if there is a failure of a system.
Each system consists of a two stage screw-type air compressor rated at 112m3/h (3,955ft3/h) at a pressure of 8 bar (128psi) in an acoustic cabinet. Each system is fitted with an air cooled control air dryer of the refrigeration type. These units are used to remove moisture from the control air supply.
The control air compressors are normally switched to automatic where they will be started and stopped by a pressure switch located on the compressor outlet manifold. The compressors will start when the pressure in the manifold falls to the load pressure setting (adjustable), and will unload when it has recovered to the unload pressure setting (adjustable), and stop after running offload for the standby run on time. Any alarm and shutdown signals generated are activated through the local controller and relayed to the CAMS.
First Draft - May 2022 SSI / CUI:
a) Confirm electrical power is available to the dryer, and the controller on the front of the enclosure is switched on.
b) Slowly pressurise the unit by opening the compressed air inlet valve. Check for any leaks.
c) After 15 minutes, slowly open the compressed air outlet valve.
d) Switch the dryer to manual or automatic (scheduled) control on the local controller. To operate the dryer manually, use the ON/OFF buttons on the control panel. To allow automatic (scheduled) operation, press the SET/RUN button on the controller.
Air dryers should be operated continuously in order to ensure that all air delivered into the control air system is free from moisture. Control and instrument systems may be damaged by the presence of moisture, and the operation of instruments and control devices can be seriously impaired by the presence of moisture. Air dryers must be operated in accordance with the manufacturer’s operating instructions. When shutting down an air dryer, the air outlet valve is closed first, followed by the inlet valve about 2 minutes later.

2.5.3 SERVICE AIR SYSTEM Service Air Compressor
through the CAMS when activated. On the discharge side of the reservoir is a distribution network to supply service air around the engine room and out on deck. The working air reservoir is protected from being over-pressurized by a relief valve set to operate at 8.8 bar (128psi).
Operating the Service Air System
a) Check all pressure gauge and instrumentation root valves are open and confirm the instruments are reading correctly.
b) Check the oil level in the service air compressor and replenish with oil of the correct grade as necessary.
c) Set the system valves in accordance with the following table. The end user valves are mostly shown as being closed, but in practice, they will be opened and closed for use as required.

The working air system is supplied with air from an electrically-driven air cooled screw compressor mounted inside an acoustic cabinet.
Only one compressor has been fitted, therefore, air from the starting air system can be used to supply the service air system if required from 30 bar to 8 bar pressure reducing valve units TA518/20 located in each engine room; this facility would normally only ever be used if the service air compressor was unavailable for use.
The service air compressor is driven by an electric motor with a direct driveto the compressor. The air flows from the engine room into the acoustic cabinet in which the compressor is housed, and into a suction filter. The air then passes through a remotely operated valve into the suction side of the compressor where the rotors operate to compress the air. The compressor unloading relief valve closes and the suction valve opens during start-up and the reverse occurs when the upper pressure set point has been reached. The compressed air then passes into a tank under the compressor in which approximately 98% of the oil contained in the air is removed. The air then passes through an air de-oiling filter which further reduces the remaining oil in the air. After this the air passes through an after-cooler and then leaves the acoustic cabinet via the compressed air outlet. The after-cooler and an oil cooler mounted inside the acoustic cabinet, are air cooled.
The compressor is normally switched to automatic where it will be started and stopped by a pressure switch located on the compressor’s outlet manifold.
On leaving the acoustic cabinet, the air enters the service air reservoir which has a capacity of 2m3 and is fitted with a low pressure alarm that operates

Back-up Air Supply for Service Air System
There is a back-up supply valve system from the starting air system to the service air system which is normally maintained in the closed position. However, these valves should be operated (opened and closed) once each month to ensure that they remain in operating condition at all times. They are normally only used in an emergency when the associated control air compressor/receiver system cannot operate. It is essential that the back-up facility from the associated starting air system is available in such circumstances.

      Note: The service air reservoir should be maintained at its full working pressure at all times, but should the air consumption be very high, or if the service air compressor is unavailable for working, the pressure reducing valves from the starting air system can be opened. Care must be exercised when doing this to ensure the starting air system is not depleted to the point where insufficient air remains to allow an immediate start of a main or auxiliary diesel generator engine.
        Note: It is important that all of the reducing valves used throughout the compressed air systems are correctly set and the set points are not changed.

2.6 FUEL OIL SYSTEMS
2.6.1 DIESEL GENERATOR FUEL OIL SYSTEM
Introduction
There are four Main Generator Engines (MGEs) fitted on the ship. They operate on MGO.
Each MGE pair (No.1 and No.2 in ER1, and No.3 and No.4 ER2) have independent fuel oil supply systems that are fed from MGO service tanks No1, 2, and 3.
Each generator pair FO supply system is fed by gravity from the MGO service tanks, which are in turn filled by the MGO separators, which take suction from the MGO settling tanks.
Each system comprises the following equipment:
• One fuel oil supply flow meter with bypass for each engine pair.
• One fuel oil return flow meter with bypass for each engine pair.
• One fuel oil leak-off flow meter with bypass for each engine pair.
• One water separator filter for each MGE.
• One stage 1 fuel filters for each MGE.
• One stage 2 fuel filters for each MGE.
MGO is drawn from an MGO service tank by gravity via a quick-closing valve on the tank outlet. These quick-closing valves can be operated from the QCV panel in emergency gear locker 2. The fuel then flows towards the MGEs through a flow meter for each engine pair, a water separator, LP FO pump, stage 1 filter, stage filter, then to the HP FO pumps. A return FO pressure regulator set to 115psi returns excess MGO back to the MGO service tank via a return FO flowmeter.
The MGEs are supplied with excess MGO to cater for changes in fuel demand due to increased electrical load. Excess fuel spilling back from each engine is returned to the MGO service tank.
The main fuel injection pumps take their suction from an engine mounted stage No.2 filter. The MGO is then directs the pressurised fuel to the injectors via the HP FO pumps. The HP FO lines on the MGEs are sheathed, and any leakage into the annular spaces is led to a FO gravity drain tank. The drain line to this tank is fitted with a leak detector. This gives warning of a leaking injector pipe. The drains from the leak tanks go to the FO overflow tank via a flow meter.
The main fuel oil inlet line to each engine is fitted with a quick-closing valve that can be tripped remotely from the fire control station.
First Draft - May 2022 SSI / CUI:
Operating the Main Generator Engine Fuel Oil System
Preliminary checks will be common to both FO systems as follows.
a) Confirm the FO suction filters are all clean, and ready for operation.
b) Confirm all instrumentation valves are open, and the instruments are working correctly.
c) Check the drains on the MGO service tank to be used, for water and sludge. assume No.1 MGO service tank is to be used.
d) Set the system valves in accordance with the following tables:
Engine Room 1 Fuel Oil System for No.1+No.2 MGEs
Assume No.1 MGO service tank is to be used.
All valves are prefixed with ‘OE’ unless otherwise stated.

Marine Gas Oil Operation
Operating the MGEs on MGO, close attention must be paid to pipe connections, seals, and mechanical seals. Vulnerable points in the supply system are more susceptible to fuel leaks when using a fuel oil grade with a reduced viscosity. The refinery process of removing sulfur from fuels, such as MGO, reduces the natural lubricity of the oil which can therefore cause a lack of lubrication between the barrel and plunger within the fuel pump, leading to excessive friction and elevated internal temperatures.

2.6.2 EMERGENCY DIESEL GENERATOR FUEL OIL SYSTEM
Introduction
The Emergency Diesel Generator (EDG) uses MGO stored in the EDG service tank which has a capacity of 11.0m3, and is located in the emergency generator room starboard side above multi purpose space. It is filled by No.2 MGO transfer pump through valve OP351. The tank is fitted with low level alarm set at 50% tank level, and a high level alarms set at 90% tank level. If the tank is overfilled, the overflow is in to an overflow coaming of capacity of 1 barrel.
The service tank is also fitted with a local gauge glass, and a self-closing ‘sludge’ cock for draining water that may have settled out from the MGO over a period of time. This drains to the separated waste oil tank No.2 via normally closed drain valve OP304.
The connection from the service tank to the EDG is fitted with a quick-closing valve OP301 that can be operated remotely by a pull wire from outside the generator room in the event of an emergency. If tripped, the valve must be manually reset before the engine can be operated. It is important this valve is opened again, and the system vented and primed immediately after being tripped to allow the engine to start automatically in the event of mains power failure.
Preparing the Emergency Diesel Generator Engine Fuel Oil System
a) Check the quantity of fuel oil in the EDG MGO service tank and replenish as necessary.
b) Sludge the service tank using valves OP302/3 to remove any water that may be present. Sludging the service tank should be done before the engine is started on test, and the day after the tank has been replenished.
c) Check the condition of the duplex fuel oil filters at the engine inlet. Ensure the standby filter is clean and ready for use.
d) Confirm the emergency generator service tank quick-closing outlet valve OP981 is open.
e) Check the engine fuel system is primed and any engine-mounted fuel oil supply and return valves on the engine are open. These are normally left open when the engine is stopped. The engine’s fuel oil system is now ready for operation.

EPC 60
The MGO enters the separator, and the centrifugal force created by the rotating bowl causes the liquid mixture to separate into its different constituents within the disc stack. The solid particles suspended in the oil settle on the underside of the discs, and slide down into the solids holding space at the periphery of the bowl. The smooth disc surfaces allow the solids to slide down, and provide self-cleaning of the discs.
Being of the self-cleaning type, the accumulated solids within the holding space are ejected at predetermined intervals depending on the quality of the oil. The cleaning cycle is achieved automatically; a number of control valves act to allow the oil to bypass the separator, and to open the bowl for a set time.
Separator Control System
The separation system is operated automatically by the EPC 60 controller. The
MGO is fed continuously to the separator, which is driven by an electric motor I via a friction clutch and belt.

i
There are four centrifugal self-cleaning MGO separators, each separator is equipped with a supply pump and filter. No.1 + No.2 MGO separators are located in ER1, and No.3 + No.4 MGO separators are located in ER2. This arrangement allows for independent fuel systems for ER1 and ER2.
Instrument air is supplied to the separators to control the supply of oil to the bowl and the automatic discharge facility. Fresh water is supplied for sealing and flushing purposes.
The MGO separators draw from the MGO settling tanks, the cleaned MGO is processed, and returned to the MGO service tanks. The MGO service tanks overflow to the MGO settling tanks. The separator throughput should be set to match the fuel consumption in the MGEs.
Separator Operation
Liquid mixtures and solid/liquid mixtures can be separated by two methods, the gravity field of a settling tank or the centrifugal field of a separator bowl. Both systems rely on the product components having different densities. Since the centrifugal force of a separator is considerably more effective than the gravity field of a settling tank, the centrifugal force method is used.
First Draft - May 2022 SSI / CUI:
The MGO is drawn from an MGO settling tank by a supply pump, then enters a separator. The processed MGO is then discharged to an MGO service tank.
Operating the Marine Gas Oil Separator
Preliminary checks will be common to both FO separating systems as follows.
a) Confirm the FO suction filters are all clean, and ready for operation.
b) Confirm all instrumentation valves are open, and the instruments are working correctly.
c) Check the drains on the MGO settling tank to be used, for water and sludge
d) Set the system valves in accordance with the following tables:
Section 2.6 - Page 7 of 10
NSMV I
The separator bowl is fixed at the top of a spindle, which is supported by
bearings and special composite springs. During operation, separated sludge
and water accumulate at the bowl periphery and are intermittently discharged FEED to the sludge tank.
The separator’s operation automatically adjusts to the nature of the oil. No gravity disc is needed. A water transducer in the clean oil outlet measures capacitative resistance and signals changes to the EPC 60 controller.
Depending on the water content, the EPC 60 either opens the drain valve or expels the water through the bowl discharge ports during sludge discharge. A patented paring tube adapts itself to remove the water from the bowl while a paring disc pumps away the clean oil.
During normal operation, vital process parameters are monitored. These parameters, as well as alarms, are indicated by easy-to-understand text messages on the LCD display of the EPC 60 controller. The EPC 60 controller provides many alarm functions, including alarms for low oil pressure, high sludge tank level and power failure.
The MGO separators require compressed air and fresh water supplies for control and bowl operation/flushing. Supply systems for these are covered in the relevant control air system and fresh water sections of this manual. Each separatorseparator

  CAUTION
 It is essential that the manufacturer’s instructions regarding the stopping and dismantling of the separator are followed to avoid the risk of damage. Separator bowls rotate at very high speed and any imbalance or loose connection may have serious consequences.
 CAUTION
  Centrifuges operate on an automatic sludging system, but failure of the system to effectively discharge sludge can cause overload and subsequent breakdown of the bowl arrangement which rotates at high speed. After manual cleaning, care is needed to ensure that the bowl is assembled correctly, as incorrect assembly can result in disintegration at high rotational speed. All operating and maintenance precautions stipulated by the manufacturer in the maintenance manual must be observed.

2.7 LUBRICATING OIL SYSTEMS
2.7.1 DIESEL GENERATOR ENGINE LUBRICATING OIL SYSTEM
Main Diesel Generator Lubricating Oil Pumps
Each MGE has its own LO sump. A level transmitter is fitted to each sump tank and this relays a volume reading to the CAMS on the corresponding mimic page. High and low level alarms are sounded when the level in the sump tank exceeds the set alarm set points. A sounding pipe with striker plate is also fitted that allows for manual sounding of the sump tanks and access to the sounding pipes is through a self-closing cock valve with securing cap. To ensure compliance with safety regulations, it is important that these valves remain in their correct working state and the securing cap is in place at all times when soundings are not being taken. A detailed description and operating procedures for the transfer of LO to and from the engine sump tanks is described below in this manual.
Note: Manual soundings of each sump tank should be done every watch and the values recorded appropriately. Close attention must be paid to level trends to ensure the gradual LO consumption is within normal limits.
Each MGE is fitted with a vertical, screw-type prelubricating pump with a pumping capacity of 7.2m3/h (32gph). The prelube pump will be running when the engine is stopped in standby, and on its run-down period when coming to a stop. The purpose of the pump is to supply pressured LO to the generator bearings to provide a sufficient oil wedge between the bearing shells, and the journals. The pump is driven by an electric motor, and is given a start signal from the engine control system during the conditions listed above. It takes suction from the associated engine sump tank before discharging the LO through the cooler, filter, then into the engine.
The pump is not required to operate when the engine is running at normal speed, and a speed pick-up sensor will stop the prelube pump once at normal operating revolutions. The prelube pump is also connected to the engine emergency shutdown system. The pump will immediately stop with the engine upon activation. Following a blackout scenario, the prelube pump will be restarted as a part of the engine sequential restart program.
An integrated engine-driven LO pump is fitted to each of the MGEs. The pump is fitted with a pressure control valve, and supplies LO to the system at the required flow rate and pressure, negating the need for the prelube pump when at operating revolutions. The engine-driven pump takes suction from the sump tank through a separate suction line. From here, the LO discharge joins a common line from the prelube pump discharge, and flows through the service system in the same manner.
LO is supplied from the pumps to the distribution manifold by first passing through an auto LO filter. After the pump discharge, LO is recirculated back to the sump through a centrifugal LO filter. The centrifugal LO filter takes part of the engine LO circulation, and backflushes the LO before being returning it to the engine sump tank. The auto filter is fitted with a differential pressure sensor that activates the flushing cycle through the control panel. The control panel displays the flush counter, and also allows the operator to activate a manual flushing cycle.
IMO No: 9910313 Produced by: WMT Limited, UK
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
The LO passes through the associated LO cooler and thermostatic regulating valve before passing through the auto filter. The LO cooler uses cooling water from the LT cooling water system, and cools the LO through a process of heat transfer across the surface area of the stainless steel plates. One cooler is provided for each MGE system, and has a cooling capacity of 100%.
The thermostatic three-way bypass valve is located at the outlet of the LO cooler, and is set to maintain an engine inlet LO temperature of 74°C (165°F) by bypassing the flow of LO around the cooler. It is possible to adjust the temperature set point of the thermo-regulating valve up to 65°C (149°F) on the engine local control panel.
The cooled LO then passes through an auto filter before flowing into the engine distribution manifold. From the engine LO distribution manifold, oil is directed to the turbocharger bearings, the pushrod guide blocks, the camshaft system (camshaft bearings and rocker boxes), and to the main bearings. The main bearing connections also supply the bottom end bearings and the gudgeon pins. The LO also flows through bores in the connecting rods up to the pistons where it serves as a coolant. The main bearing temperatures are monitored by means of temperature probes and this information is relayed to the engine control system and the CAMS workstations.
The LO is returned to the crankcase sump tank, where it may then be processed through the service system for reuse. The crankcase is provided with an oil mist detector in order to safeguard against the risk of a crankcase explosion. It is essential that this detector device is regularly checked and its alarm operation must be tested frequently. The crankcase and sump tank are fitted with a breather system which prevents over-pressure due to piston blow-by.
Each MGE crankcase vent is led to to its exhaust pipe that exits at the funnel stack to atmosphere via a silencer. The drains from the silencer drain down to a sealing pot that overflows to bilge.

There are various items that make up the LO service system, with each individual system containing the following:
• Engine-driven LO pump.
• Motor-driven prelube pump.
• Automatic back-wash filter
• Centrifugal filter.
• LO cooler with self-actuated thermo-regulating valve.

Setting-up and Operating the Diesel Generator Engine Lubricating Oil System
The procedure below is applicable for all the MGEs.
a) Ensure that the LO level in the MGE sump tank is at an adequate level. If top-up is required, please follow the LO transfer procedures.
b) Ensure that the MGE LT fresh water cooling system is operating, and that the main cooling sea water system is in operation for cooling of the LT water. Check that cooling water is circulating effectively through the LO cooler of each engine.
c) Ensure that there is power at the automatic backflushing filter and that the filter is operating correctly.
d) Ensure that all pressure gauge and instrumentation valves/cocks are open, and that all instruments are reading correctly and control systems are operational.
e) The prelube pump should be set for REMOTE operation at the local control panel and then for AUTO at the engine mimic. The alternator DE and NDE LO pumps should be set to remote operation and automatic; this ensures that the prelube pump and the alternator LO pumps will start when an engine is in standstill condition.
f) When the engine starts, check that the prelube pump stops above a predetermined engine speed level. When the engine is running, check the LO pressures at all parts of the system and ensure the temperature is being correctly regulated and no leaks are present in the system.

2.7.2 PROPULSION MOTOR/SHAFT LUBRICATING OIL SYSTEMS
Propulsion Electric Motor Lubrication Pump
Type: Screw, Twin pump
No. of sets: 8 (4 for each propulsion motor)
Thrust Block Lubrication
• Low pressure jacking oil system alarm.
• Jacking oil system filter alarm.
• Jacking oil system low-low pressure alarm, low pressure alarm and standby pump start.
The bearings are fitted with temperature sensors for alarm/trip functions, and the oil circulation system has pressure and flow switches which activate alarms should the system operating conditions move outside the preset levels. The LO level in the bearing sump must be checked, and replenished as necessary. There is a level switch which activates a level alarm should the LO level fall below a predetermined value. A PEM jacking pump must be running, and the LO pressure must be above a threshold before a PEM may be started.
Thrust Block Lubrication
The thrust bearing is of the self lubricated type, and composed of two faces of tilting pad thrust bearings resting over a pivoting surface that transmits the thrust load to the bearing housing. The rigidity of the thrust bearing creates resistance, and the position of the supporting legs minimizes the tilting effect.
The thrust bearing is designed for supporting axial, and radial loads. The thrust bearing is designed with identical thrust pads at both sides of the thrust flange, and one radial bearing shell installed at forward side of the thrust flange.
The LO circulation system is of the self-lubricated type, with a LT fresh water supplied cooling coil integrated in the oil sump of the unit for LO cooling.
A seal system is fitted at both sides of the thrust bearing unit to prevent any LO leakage at different pitch inclinations, during the normal operation of the ship. Other functions of the seal system is to prevent the sea water ingress into the unit if the engine room is in flooded (emergency condition) for SRtP conditions of 8 metres above the shaft.
The thrust bearing includes all the devices for measuring the temperatures (remote and local control) of the ahead and astern thrust bearings, the radial bearing, and the temperature of the oil sump. There is an LO level dipstick for checking the LO level inside the unit.
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
Intermediate Shaft Bearing Lubrication
The intermediate shaft bearing absorbs the radial forces of the shaft, and transfers these forces into the foundations of the ship. The intermediate shaft bearing does not absorb axial forces but supports that part of the shaft system located between PEM1 and PEM2. The intermediate shaft bearing meets the requirements for continued operation in case of flooding (SRtP rerquirements) by having a ‘SIMPLEX’ seal mounted on each side of the bearing.
The intermediate shaft bearing is lubricated without an external oil supply. While the shaft is rotating, lubrication takes place from the lower housing, below of the intermediate shaft bearing, which is filled with LO up to the ‘MAX’ mark on the dipstick. A two-part oil ring, which is attached to the shaft, transfers the oil from the lower housing, to the upper part of the upper housing. A movable oil scraper fitted to the oil ring ensures that the intermediate shaft bearing is sufficiently, and evenly supplied with LO. The LO is cooled via a cooling coil which is supplied with fresh water from the LT fresh water cooling system. Because oil is thrown over the bearing by the oil ring, the actual level of oil in the shaft bearing can only be determined accurately when the propeller shaft is stationary. The oil ring is rotated by the shaft, and the lower part of the ring dips into the oil bath. LO is picked up by the oil ring as the shaft rotates and the oil is removed from the ring by the scraper, and distributed to the bearing. From the bearing the oil falls back to the bottom of the bearing housing. The level of LO in the bearing housing must be checked frequently, and the oil in the bearing housing replenished as necessary.
The operating temperature is monitored by the temperature monitoring system. A temperature sensor is mounted on the intermediate shaft bearing. The temperature sensor of the resistance thermometer measures the operating temperature in the bearing shell. The measured temperature is transmitted electronically to the alarm control system. A dial thermometer is also attached to the intermediate shaft bearing.
The intermediate shaft bearings are fitted with the following alarm limits:
• High LO temperature alarm set at 65°C.
• High-high LO temperature alarm set at 85°C.
Temperature Increases to Maximum Alarm Temperature
Too high operating temperatures can damage the intermediate shaft bearing.

Propulsion Electric Motor Lubrication
The Propulsion Electric Motors (PEMs) have two pedestal journal bearings, one at the drive end and one at the non-drive end. Each PEM bearing system has two LO jacking pumps. Each bearing is self-lubricated under normal running conditions. For low speed &lt;55 rpm, the jacking units, consisting of two motor-driven pumps (one in service, one in standby), jack up or lift the motor shaft at starting, and at low speeds. In case of a blackout, the shaft line must stop within 15 minutes maximum when running down from 55 rpm to 0 rpm, or the bearing white metal will be damaged.
The jacking units are not oil circulating units as their function is only to lift the rotor when it is running between 0 rpm to 55 rpm. Above 55 rpm, the oil film into the bearing is self-created by rotation of the shaft and bearing design. There is no need for the jacking units to run above 55 rpm. One jacking pump is set to run at &lt;55 rpm, with the second pump on standby should the selected running pump fail to start. The pumps are controlled by the automatic system in the propulsion auxiliaries group, and are selected for remote operation.
The bearing pump LO system is supplemented by an oil pick-up ring and scraper system. The oil ring sits on the journal and its lower end dips into the oil bath. When the PEM is turning, the oil pick-up ring is rotated by the journal, and the oil which adheres to the pick-up ring is scraped off the ring by the scraper and distributed to the journal bearing. The oil ring pick-up system is assisted by the jacking pump which circulates oil from the bearing sump back to the bearing via an oil filter.
Each PEM system is controlled by two control devices that receive the following signals:
• Bearing oil temperature, high temperature, alarm and slowdown.
• Shell bearing oil temperature, high temperature, alarm and slowdown.
• Low oil level alarm.
• Low flow jacking oil system alarm.
1) 2)
Reduce speed immediately if the alarm temperature is reached or exceeded.
Do not stop the shaft as there is a risk that the shaft will fuse with the white metal layer of the bearing shell, which will make restarting impossible.

feeding its own bus. Interlocking is provided to allow two out of three circuit breakers to close at any one time.
• If a transformer should fail the bus tie will close automatically, and the remaining transformer will supply both busses.
• The No.1 LV main switchboard to No.2 LV main switchboard interconnector circuit breakers are mechanically locked to prevent inadvertent closure.
• The four main 440V load center panels are fed via redundant feeds from either No.1 or No.2 LV main switchboard the circuit breakers of which are always closed. The redundant circuit breakers at the load centers are interlocked to prevent closure of both at the same time. If primary power should be lost, an auto changeover circuit will activate and repower the boards. Manual control of the incoming circuit breaker is also available using the LOCAL/REMOTE switch.
• The emergency switchboard is fed from either No.1 LVMSB or No.2 LVMSB the circuit breakers of which are always closed. The two incomer circuit breakers at the emergency switchboard are interlocked so only one can be closed at the same time. If primary power is lost the incomer circuit breaker will trip on under voltage and an auto changeover circuit will close the other breaker and power the emergency switchboard. This auto changeover should take minimum time so as not to cause the emergency generator to start.
2. Transit at 12 knots
• This mode allows the engineers to shut down one complete engine room for training purposes.
• Two generators and one propulsion motor operating at 60% nominal power, either of the propulsion motors can be used.
• Both 6.6kV main switchboards are energised and are configured to operate in open ring mode, with the bus tie of either one open and both interconnecting breakers between them closed
• Each main 450V engine room LV switchboard is fed from their respective 6.6kV switchboard bus via redundanr transformers, each of which is rated to carry 100% of the total load. Under normal operation the bus tie is open with each transformer feeding its own bus. Interlocking is provided to allow two out of three circuit breakers to close at any one time.
• If a transformer should fail the bus tie will close automatically, and the remaining transformer will supply both busses.
• The four main 450V load center panels are fed from the active engine room LV main switchboard.
SSI / CUI:
• Should electrical training or repair work be required on the inactive engine room HV main switchboard or the LV main switchboard, both can be shut down and isolated, the vessel can then be run from the active engine room. In this case the load centers would receive their power from the active switcboards but with no backup.
3. Manoeuvring Mode
• In this mode all four generators must be running.
• Both propulsion motors, the bow and stern thrusters will be operating in this mode.
• The 6.6kV switchboard bus ties will be closed and the interconnecting circuit breakers will be open this will result in two independent power systems. This minimizes the consquences should a failure occur on the main busses during critical manoeuvering operations.
• As the power system is divided into two separate power sources with each one using two generators, under normal operating conditions with a loading factor of 90% the available power on each system will be approximately 7.2MW. Should a generator trip, the load shedding system has to take into account the No.1 load center panel (PT-1 group) might be fed from the non-failure switchboard.
• Should a transformer fail the bus tie will close and the remaining transformer will feed both busses.
4. In Port Full Compliment (AMP)
• Due to the vessel’s service it will spend a considerable period of time alongside, during this time all the vessel’s generators will be shut down and power will be obtained from shore side by way of one of the 6.6kV AMP connections one to port and one to starboard, these are rated at 6.4MW/700A.
• To prevent black out during connection, interlocking and synchronizing facilities are provided.
• The two 6.6kV HV main switchboards operate in open ring mode with the bus tie of either one open and the interconnecting circuit breakers between them closed.
• Each main 450V engine room LV switchboard is fed from their respective 6.6kV switchboard bus via redundanr transformers, each of which is rated to carry 100% of the total load. Under normal operation the bus tie is open with each transformer feeding its own bus. Interlocking is provided to allow two out of three circuit breakers to close at any one time.
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
• Should a transformer fail the bus tie will close and the remaining transformer will feed both busses.
• If the shore power should becomes unavailable, one or two of the main generators will be started and put online depending upon summer/winter loading.
5. Cross Feed Mode 450V LV Switchboard to Switchboard (for emergency use only)
• This operation is used if there is some kind of catastrophic failure such as a multiple transformer failure on one LV main switchboard, or during a vessel.
• The cross feed connection circuit breakers are normally physically locked out and interlocks are provided to prevent connecting two live LV main switchboards.
• Monitoring of the load will have to take place to ensure that the transformers are not overloaded.
6. Laid Up, Repair modes.
• Shore 440V supply connections are available on both port and starboard side, these connect to No.1 LV main switchboard bus 1 and No.2 LV main switchboard bus 4. These can be used during repairs to the HV system, or during drydock periods.
• Interlocks are provided between the shore supply circuit breakers and the transformer secondary circuit breakers.
• The emergency 450V switchboard to switchboard crossfeed can be closed to power the opposite LV main switchboards.

8. Safe Return to Port (SRTP) via Bow Thruster
• One generator with the bow thruster running with an approximate speed of 8 knots.
9. Black Out Mode
• If a complete power failure should occur, both No.1 and No.2 LV main switchboard interconnection circuit breakers to the emergency switchboard in the emergency switchboard will trip on undervoltage. The emergency generator will start automatically and will connect to the dead emergency switchboard and will supply power to all the emergency loads (this should happen within 40 seconds of the detection of a power failure.
• Once power has been re-established to the vessel’s critical systems, the black start sequence can be initiated and the main generators restarted, and the main power returned to the system.

Automatic Start of a DG and Connection to a Dead Bus Due to a Blackout.
Should a blackout occur the following steps will be initiated by the PMS:
a) The PMS on receiving a blackout signal will immediately give a START command to the 1st standby generator.
b) The generator will start and run up to nominal voltage.
c) The PMS will issue a CLOSE command to the relevant VCB which will close.
d) The 6.6kV main switchboard is now under power.
Disconnection of a Generator Circuit Breaker
When a disconnect command is given by the operator, it will cause an automatic load reduction of the generator. Providing the generator is in symmetrical or asymmetrical load sharing mode, when the generator load is less than 5%, the PMS will give a signal to the switchboard to open the generator circuit breaker. If the generator stop is caused by an automatic stop request from the PMS (load dependent stop), the generator downloading and breaker opening will be performed automatically, without operator intervention.
Generator circuit breaker disconnect can be initiated by one of the following conditions:
• A disconnect request from one of the operator stations.
• A load dependent stop (if the generator is in standby)
• A stop initiated by the generator’s safety system (if the generator is in standby)
For the PMS to disconnect a generator from the switchboard bus, the following criteria must be followed:
• The generator must not be in local control.
• There must be more than one generator connected to the switchboard.
• The generator’s share of the load must be less than 5% of the total load.
• Internal blocking criteria (e.g. not reset after downloading timeout)
If the disconnection is the result of a command from the activation of the diesel engine safety system, the generator circuit breaker will be disconnected regardless of external or internal disconnect blocking or generator load.
If a circuit breaker OPEN feedback signal is not received within the time period of the load reduction time out, a disconnection failure alarm will be raised.
First Draft - May 2022 SSI / CUI:
Load Dependent Start/Stop of Generators
If the load on the running generators reaches 85% of the total capacity of these running generators for more than 30 seconds, the next standby generator in line will be started by the PMS, synchronize, connect to the bus and share the load with the other generators.
If after a period of time the load on all the running generators should drop to 65% of the total capacity of the running generators minus 1 for more than 60 seconds, the PMS will transfer the load from the last generator to be started to the other generators and will disconnect it and send a STOP command to it.
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
Preferential Tripping
For the prevention of blackout circumstances, there are two scenarios for the activation of the preferential trips:
• Frequency - If the frequency of the supply should fall below 57Hz for 5 secs, PT-1 will trip. If the frequency were to remain below 57Hz for a further 5 secs then PT-2 will trip.
• Load - If the load on the generators is 100% for 5 secs then PT-1 will trip, if the load remains at 100% for a further 5 secs then PT-2 will trip.
The following are the affected units:
PT-1
• No.1 load center panel
• No.1 to No.10 hot water calorifiers
PT-2
• Starters No.1 to 4 A/C chilled water plants
• Control panels AHU No.1 to No.5
• Control panels AHU No.7 to No.16
• Starters for chilled water pumps No.1 to No.4
• Starters for heated water pumps No.1 to No.4
• Control panels for FCU1 and 2
• Control panels for FCU4 to 10
• RPD-1
• Control panels for provision refrigeration plant compressors No.1 and No.2
• Control panel for refrigerated provision store 1/2 and lobbies • Control panel for refrigeration system of daily room (galley)
Start Blocking of Heavy Consumers
The heavy consumers on this vessel are the bow thruster (1800kW) and stern thrusters (890kW) If the PMS receives a start request from the bow or stern thusters it will evaluate if there is sufficient spinning reserve of power to start, if there is not, then the PMS will start the next generator that is in standby and when it is on line and synchronized the PMS will then issue a start enable signal to the thruster to start.

Load Sharing
Load sharing modes can be selected individually for each generator and is based on active power (kW).
The following load sharing options are available under the PMS:
• Symmetrical load sharing.
• Asymmetrical load sharing.
• Fixed load.
• Manual load sharing.
For control of load sharing and network frequency, speed increase and decrease signals (pulses) are sent to the speed governor. Speed droop is always applied (about 5%).
Symmetrical Load Sharing
In symmetrical load sharing, each generator that is connected to the switchboard takes an equal share of the load, a small deadband of 1% of rated power is allowed, this is because not all the generators have exactly the same characteristics and this allows for slight differences in the generators.
Asymmetrical Load Sharing
Asymmetrical load sharing is used as a maintenance function to burn off carbon deposits that have accumulated during extended low load operation of the generators.
One of the generators will be selected as the master and will be loaded to 80% of the total load. The remaining load will be shared between the remaining running generators (slaves).
After 4 hours the master generator will automatically change over to the next generator.
If the load on the slave generators falls below 30% of the total load, the load on the master generator will be reduced.
The load will be shared symmetrically between the running generators if the load on the slave generators should rise above 80%.
Fixed Load
At times it is necessary to run a generator at a steady load for maintenance purposes. This is achieved by selecting fixed load mode, in this mode the selected generator runs at a fixed steady load. While the generator is in fixed load mode the other running generators take care of any rise or reduction in load.
The setpoint of the fixed load is selected by the operator, it will be maintained at this level by the PMS.
When a generator is selected for standby, it cannot be selected for fixed load mode.
Manual Load Sharing
In manual load sharing mode, the operator adjusts the load on the generator that is in manual load mode by using the raise and lower speed switches at the operator station.
The PMS has no active role in this mode.
When a generator is selected for standby, it cannot be selected for manual load mode.
Frequency Control of the Network.
The PMS maintains the steady state frequency of the common bus bar to a programmed set point, by control of the prime mover governors.
Individual generator kW loadings are calculated and compared with the actual monitored loadings. If the errors are not within a pre-defined deadband, speed raise or lower pulsed output commands are sent to the respective governor(s)
Automatic Recovery of Main Switchboard Power in the Event of a System Blackout.
The hardwired blackout recovery logic of the emergency switchboard, starts and connects the emergency generator on detection of a blackout. The starting and stopping of the emergency generator is without the intervention of the PMS.
The emergency switchboard supplies all the essential services rerquired to start the main generators, the PMS will initiate a blackout recovery sequence as follows:

the 6,6kV VCB and the power on the 450V switchboard will be restored.
With power restored to the 450V switchboard the PMS will start all the services that do not have under voltage trips that were running before the blackout.
If the propulsion system was running before the blackout, it will be started.
All the consumers that were tripped on under voltage at blackout will then be started manually until full service is restored.

When a blackout is detected, the PMS issues a BLACKOUT CONDITION alarm, all the 6.6kV switchboard VCBs will be tripped by under voltage trips.
The PMS issues a START command to the generators, the generators will run up to their nominal voltage the PMS will issue CLOSE commands to the generators. When the first generator reaches its nominal voltage its VCB will close, then when the second generator has reached its nominal voltage it will synchronize with the bus and its VCB will also close and so on. When the 6.6kV bus bar is live the PMS will issue CLOSE commands to the 6.6kV ship services transformers associated with the live bus bar, this will initiate the pre-magnetization of the transformers, and their VCBs will close.

Procedure to Connect to 440V Shore Power
The following steps should be taken for safe connection of the shore power:
a) The main switchboards should be set to manual to prevent the start of the main generators when the vessel blacks-out.
b) The breakers of the consumers of the 6.6kV switchboards should be opened, and the running generators reduced to one. All non-essential services should be isolated and the load on the 440V switchboards reduced to an absolute minimum. The sequential restart facility should also be disabled.
c) The emergency generator should be placed in MANUAL MODE at the emergency generator local control panel to prevent it starting when vessel blacks-out.
d) Before connecting any cables from shore, it should be confirmed with the shore personnel that the breaker ashore is disconnected. After checking with a meter to confirm this, the shore cables are plugged into the sockets of the relevant connection box.
e) When the cables are connected, the shore personnel should be requested to close the circuit-breaker ashore.
f) A check is then made of the voltage and the frequency. If these are correct, a check is then made of the phase sequence indication observed on the phase sequence indicator (PSI). If the phase sequence indicator shows that the phase sequence is incorrect, the shore side is requested to open the circuit-breaker ashore and change over two of the phases. The shore side is then asked to close the shore circuit-breaker. The phase sequence should now be correct. The voltage, current and frequency can be monitored from meters on the shore connection panel of the 440V low voltage switchboard.
g) After informing the vessel by PA that there will be a blackout for a few seconds, the circuit-breaker of the connected generator is opened and the vessel will black-out.
h) The shore connection circuit-breaker should now be closed.

Generator Start and Stop Priority via HMI.
The generator start and stop priority is selected by using the human machine Interface (HMI) of the PMS display screen.
Minimum Number of Generators Online via the HMI
The minimum number of generators required foir the different modes of operation of this vessel is selected by using the HMI of the PMS display screen
Power Limitation of Propulsion Drives
The PMS has no control over the propulsion system, however the propulsion system monitors the power availability and if this reduces for whatever reason the propulsion system will reduce its power requirements by reducing the speed of the propulsion. When the power reduction is ended then the propulsion system will increase its power requirements to its normal level.

g) When the connections are made the cable reel selector switch is then placed into the AUTO position, this will activate a timer that will operate the reel motor for 10 seconds every 10 minutes (adjustable) this will reel in any slack that occurs due to the movement of the vessel owing to wind, tide or changes in the draft. The hydrodynamic drive system of the reel allows for the cable to unwind if any tension is applied to it so that the cable can never be over tensioned.
Operation of the AMP Reel (Raising)
The following steps are taken to disconnect from the AMP connection:
a) Ensure that the POWER ON indicator is lit (white) on the reel control panel. Ensure that REEL READY indicator is lit (white) if not check if Q2 and Q3 are closed (inside cabinet).
b) Using the cable reel selector switch on the pendant box (MANUAL/AUTO), place the switch into the MANUAL position and make sure the EMERGENCY STOP switch is not in the operating position.
c) Press the DOWN push button on the pendant box enough to slacken the cables a little. The shore can then unplug the cables from their sockets and the protective covers and sleeves are replaced on the plugs. The cable socks can then be released from their fixings
d) Press the UP button to reel in the cable. Although the plugs in their protective covers can be dragged along the wharf it is better that they be carried as the cable is reeled in.
e) Continue pressing the UP button until the upper limit is reached and the reel will stop.
f) With the assistance of a second person to guide the plugs into their stowed position press the DOWN button until they are resting lightly on the deck.
g) On the cable guide switchbox place the guide ON/OFF switch into the ON position and press the UP button until the guide is fully retracted.

There are interlocks between the circuit breakers of the generators and the shore circuit breaker, this prevents any of the generator’s VCBs from closing if the shore circuit breaker is closed and vice versa.
Procedure to Disconnect from 440V Shore Power
a) Reduce the load on the 440V low voltage main switchboards and emergency switchboard to an absolute minimum.
b) Place the emergency generator in MANUAL mode, to prevent it starting automatically when the switchboard blacks out.
c) Start and run up a 6.6kV main generator in manual mode. Check the voltage and frequency and adjust if necessary.
d) Make an announcement on the PA system that there will shortly be a blackout.
e) Open the shore connection circuit breaker in the shore connection panel, the switchboards will blackout. The interconnect circuit breaker between the 440V main switchboard and the emergency switchboard in the emergency switchboard will trip due to a dead 440V low voltage main switchboard.
f) Close the VCB of the running main generator using the relevant VCB CLOSE switch on the 6.6kV main switchboard.
g) The 6.6kV main switchboard will now be powered, the interconnect circuit breaker between the 6.6kV main switchboard and the 440V main switchboard will close automatically and the interconnect circuit breaker between the 440V low voltage switchboard and the emergency switchboard will also close automatically and will be powered by the main generator.
h) Request by radio that the shore side open their ACB, when this is confirmed to have been done, then they can be disconnected and lowered ashore.
i) Another main generator can be started and connected in automatic mode and the load shared between them. The original generator can then be unloaded and stopped and then put into auto and then standby, if more power is required it will start automatically and connect and load share, the switchboards are now back to normal.
j) Place the emergency generator back in AUTO mode.
k) Ensure that all essential loads have started automatically, if any have not they should be started manually.
6.6kV Shore Power (AMP)
There are two AMP connections one to port and one to starboard, the cable reels are located on accommodation level 02, No.1 (starboard) at frame 60 and No.2 (port) at frame 55. The cables are fed to the 6.6kv HV shore connection panel in the HV shore connection room on the starboard side No.2 deck at frame 58 - 65.
Operation of the AMP Reel (Lowering).
The following steps are taken to connect to AMP connection :
a) Ensure that the POWER ON indicator is lit (white) on the reel control panel. Ensure that REEL READY indicator is lit both on the reel control panel and on the shore power panel of the 6.6kV main switchboard (white) if not check if Q2 and Q3 are closed (inside cabinet).
b) Using the cable guide switchbox (located on the fwd frame of the reel unit), place the cable guide selector switch into the ON position, then press the LOWER push button, the cable guide will lower to its operating position, there is a limit switch so it cannot lower past its correct position. When the guide has reached its operating position and is stopped by the limit switch, place the cable guide selector switch into the OFF position
c) Using the cable reel selector switch on the pendant box (MANUAL/AUTO), place the switch into the MANUAL position and make sure the EMERGENCY STOP switch is not in the operating position.
d) Press the UP push button on the pendant box, this will lift the plugs from their stowed position the reel will only rotate a little until the up limit switch is activated..
e) With the assistance of another person to guide the plugs into the correct position on the guide, press the DOWN push button on the pendant box.
f) Make sure the plugs are placed correctly in the bottom window of the guide and that they do not snag. Keep the DOWN push button pressed until the plugs reach the required position where the shore personnel will pull the plugs and cables to the connection point. Before connection the nylon protection sleeves must be pulled back and the plug covers removed. the cables are then secured using the cable socks that are provided. The plugs are then connected into their appropriate colour coded sockets.

Switchboard Electrical Interlocking
The Local-Manual synchronising of each switchboard section will only op- erate if all other 6.6kV Main switchboard synchronising section sync select switches are in the ‘OFF’ position.
General Switchboard Interlocks
• The dead bus voltage trip will prevent all feeder circuit breakers from closing onto a dead bus. This excludes generators and bus-ties/interconnectors. The bus-ties/interconnectors are only prevented from closing if both switchboards are dead
• The generator and AMP shore panel feed incoming circuit breakers are able to close onto a dead bus.
• In the event of a lockout trip the circuit breaker is prevented from closing if the fault is not cleared and lockout manually reset.
• If a generator engine is not running its circuit breaker cannot close.
• The generator circuit breakers will trip on:
• Engine shutdown,
• Governor major fault
• AVR watchdog fault
• Diode short circuit or loss of sensing,
• Protection relay fault
• ESD Emergency shutdown.
• The generator is only available for PMS control if the engine is in REMOTE mode and the selector switch at the generator incomer panel is switched to REMOTE and all lockout protection trips are healthy.
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
• The diesel engine is inhibited from starting in both remote and local modes if the generator circuit breaker is earthed or if the lockout fault has not been cleared and manually reset.
• The switchboard will trip the diesel engine and de-excite the generator on a lockout protection fault.
• Unless the thruster converter has not been precharged or the thruster transformer has not been pre-magnetised, and all CB inhibits are not healthy the thruster transformer circuit breaker cannot close. This interlock is a function of the converter.
• The thruster transformer CB trips in the event of a drive system fault or EMERGENCY STOP.
• If the feeder circuit breaker of the propulsion transformer is in the TEST position the thruster converter is inhibited from pre-charge.
• Thruster transformer and ship service transformer feeder circuit breakers trip on winding over temperature.
• It is imperative that in the event of a lockout trip, the fault must be investigated before any lockout relays are reset and before any attempt is made to close the affected circuit breaker. When multiple lockout trips occur eg, generators and bus-ties, this indicates that a fault exists on the busbar or interconnecting cable and as such must not be made live until the problem has been investigated and rectified.
• Interlocking shall prohibit closed ring operation and ensure that at least one bus section stays open.
• Interlocking is provided to allow for only momentary synchronizing of AMP shore power.
Interlocking between 6.6kV and LV Systems
The design of the system is such that all four main generators can operate at once in single island mode.
The following electrical interlocks are provided, to ensure that the system operates in a safe and reliable manner,

Interlocking at 450V Main and 440V Emergency Switchboard
• Interlocks are provided to ensure that one out of three breakers are opened at the 450V switchboard.
• Interlocks to ensure that the shore supply connected on 450V switchboards is not running in parallel with ship’s main supply.
• Interlocks are provided to ensure that only one of the two interconnectors from the 450V switchboards to the emergency switchboard is active. To that end there is an interlock between the interconnecter at No.1 450V switchboard and No.2 450V switchboard so only one can close at one time. The interconnector circuit breakers at the Emergency Switchboard are also interlocked so that only one of them can be closed.
• Interlocks are provided to ensure that one out of three breakers, emergency generator incomer circuit breaker, or a interconnector circuit breaker from the 450V switchboard are connected at emergency switchboard at any one time.
• Interlocking is provided for 450V switchboard interconnector circuit breakers so that they may only be closed if both incomer circuit breakers on the receiving switchboard are open.
Insulation Monitoring
6.6kV HV Switchboards High Resistance Grounding (HRG) System
In ships the earthed neutral point is prohibited as if an earth fault should occur very high levels of earth fault current would make it impossible to operate with an earth fault. The HRG system is used to counter this. The HRG system uses ground protection transformers (GPT) these consist of three single phase transformers with their primaries connected in star formation to each of the phases of the bus with the neutral point earthed. The secondaries are connected in an open delta configuration with a resistor connected across the open delta connection. Each HV bus is equipped with a GPT. The Sepam protection relays are connected across these resistors.
When the system is healthy and no earth faults are present the primary voltages of the GPT are balanced and so the secondaries are at zero volts and so no current will flow. Should an earth fault occur on one of the phases this would cause a voltage to be produced in the secondaries, this will cause a current to flow which is restricted by the resistor, a corresponding current will also flow in the primaries restricted by the resistor. Across this resistor Sepam 80 protection relays are connected, These will produce a two stage trip the first stage will trip the bus-ties and the interconnecter VCBs thus isolating the busses. If the fault still persists on one of the busses the second stage will cause the respective generator VCB to trip.
Earth monitor lamps are also provided on the front panels of the GPTs, these will indicate in which phase the fault occurs.
450V Ship Service Switchboards
The 450V ship service switchboards are monitored by DEIF SIMQ Mk11 insulation meters, if the insulation should fall below the programmed level of 0.5 MΩ. an alarm will be raised to both the PMS and CAMS.
Earth lamps are provided on the incoming panels to detect on which phase the low insulation is, the phase that has caused the alarm can be determined by the use of the earth lamps. The lamp that dims or extinguishes is the one on the faulty phase. The faulty equipment has then to be isolated by opening the breaker of each piece of equipment in turn while monitoring the insulation resistance monitor meter and when the breaker of the faulty equipment is opened the meter will show high resistance. This should only be done after consultation so as not to compromise the operations of the systems.
120V Switchboards
The 120V feeders are monitored by DEIF AAL-2 insulation monitors set to 0.1 MΩ. Earth lamps are provided on the incoming panels to detect on which phase the low insulation is, the phase that has caused the alarm can be determined by the use of the earth lamps. The lamp that dims or extinguishes is the one on the faulty phase. The faulty equipment has then to be isolated by opening the breaker of each piece of equipment in turn while monitoring the insulation resistance monitor meter and when the breaker of the faulty equipment is opened the meter will show high resistance. This should only be done after consultation so as not to compromise the operations of the systems.
Load Center Panels
No.1 and No.2 load center panels are monitored by DEIF AAL-2 insulation monitors set to 0.1 MΩ. Earth lamps are provided on the incoming panels to detect on which phase the low insulation is, the phase that has caused the alarm can be determined by the use of the earth lamps. The lamp that dims or extinguishes is the one on the faulty phase. The faulty equipment has then to be isolated by opening the breaker of each piece of equipment in turn while monitoring the insulation resistance monitor meter and when the breaker of the faulty equipment is opened the meter will show high resistance. This should only be done after consultation so as not to compromise the operations of the systems.
Receptacle Distribution Boards
The three receptacle distribution boards are monitored by DEIF AAL-2 insulation monitors set to 0.1 MΩ. Earth lamps are provided on the incoming panels to detect on which phase the low insulation is, the phase that has caused the alarm can be determined by the use of the earth lamps. The lamp that dims or extinguishes is the one on the faulty phase. The faulty equipment has then to be isolated by opening the breaker of each group of receptaclest in turn while monitoring the insulation resistance monitor meter and when the breaker of the faulty equipment is opened the meter will show high resistance. This should only be done after consultation so as not to compromise the operations of the systems.

6.6kV Switchboard 110Vdc Control Voltage Uninterruptible Power Supply
So as not to lose the 6.6kV main switchboard control voltage in the event of a blackout, each 6.6kV main switchboard has a 110Vdc UPS. These will seamlessly take of the provision of the 110Vdc control voltage in the event of a power loss.
The input voltage 440Vac is transformed down to 118V, rectified and fed to the output as 110Vdc and also charges the batteries. Should the 440Vac be lost due to a blackout, the batteries would seamlessly take over the duties of the 110Vdc control voltage.
These UPS are redundant as each one supplies both switchboards and also the AMP shore power switchboards, so if one should fail the other one will take over all the control voltage duties.
The UPS specification is as follows:

3.5 ELECTRICAL SAFETY AND PERMIT TO WORK SYSTEM
High Voltage
High voltage circuits are potentially more dangerous than low or medium voltage circuits. This is not only due to the increased voltage, but also the explosion risk, and because under certain circumstances, high voltage circuits can retain a lethal charge even when switched off. In addition, dangerous potentials exist some distance from the actual live high voltage conductors, the distance being determined by the conductor voltage, and the dielectric strength of the insulating materials (including air) surrounding the conductor.
It is therefore essential that all persons who may be required to work on, or operate high voltage apparatus, are fully aware of the hazards and how to avoid the associated danger.
Personnel carrying out high voltage isolation, earthing, maintenance and inspection should have high voltage training.
High voltage apparatus is classified as any apparatus, equipment and conductors which are normally operated at a voltage exceeding 1,000V AC or 1,500V DC.
A Permit to Work system should be established onboard to issue permits to work to the authorised person in charge of work that is to be carried out on the earthed high voltage apparatus, detailing exactly what apparatus is dead, isolated from all live conductors, discharged, connected to earth, and on which it is safe to work.
A key interlocking system is provided for 6.6kV parts, where access to live electrical parts can be reached without using tools. All other parts such as generators and motors are closed, and can be opened only by skilled personnel using tools. The key interlocking system allows for safe access to high voltage equipment for maintenance and repair.
WARNING
At all times the Company’s policies on high voltage safety must be adhered to and the Permit to Work system must be followed.
Permit to Work
If maintenance or inspection is required to be carried out on any high voltage equipment, a risk assessment should be conducted, and a Company Permit to Work certificate must be obtained and completed.
The Permit to Work certificate is to be signed by the Chief Engineer officer.
‘Caution’ and ‘Danger Live’ notices are to be displayed at all points where the work is being carried out, and near parts that are live or may be made live.
First Draft - May 2022 SSI / CUI:
Prior to any work being carried out, the item of equipment or circuit is to be isolated from all sources of possible supply, earthed and tested to ensure that the circuit or equipment is dead.
Cancellation of the Permit to Work certificate must be signed by the person actually carrying out the work and the Chief Engineer officer.
Permit to Work Procedure
a) Issue the Permit to Work.
b) Place the neccesary safety notices in locations that will give a good warning to the vessel’s personnel to keep away from the work area.
c) Switch off the equipment on which the Permit to Work is to be issued.
d) Isolate from all sources of supply including voltage transformers. Where physical isolation of the primary is not possible, remove secondary fuses and secure to prevent replacement.
e) Prove the circuit dead.
f) Discharge to earth (where possible through the earth switch).
g) Apply circuit mains earth and secure them to prevent removal.
h) Prove the circuit dead at the point of work to the person who is to receive the Permit to Work or sanction for test.
The named authorised person is responsible for carrying out the above steps in a safe manner.
Mechanical Key Interlocking
Owing to the high voltages present in the 6,6kV main switchboards, stringent safety measures must be taken when ever any work or maintenance is carried out on them.
Each VCB has an earthing switch associated with it. The VCBs and the earthing switches are mechanically interlocked, this prevents the earth switch being closed when the VCB is closed and vice versa.

3.6 MAIN ALTERNATORS
This vessel’s main power generation capacity is provided by four Hyundai HSJ9 913-08P diesel alternators.
Diesel Generators
The diesel alternators have the following characteristics:
The stator windings have six PT100 temperature probes embedded in them, three active and three spare
Rotor
The rotor consists of a core made up of electrical steel laminations insulated from each other compressed between two end plates and shrink fitted onto a forged steel shaft.
The windings are placed into slots formed when the laminations were pressed out, these windings are wedged into the slots tightly and the ends of the windings are supported with glass fibre bindings.
When the winding slots were formed during the pressing of the individual laminations holes were also formed that when the laminations are clamped together form cooling ducts in the core of the rotor, this greatly enhances the cooling and circulation of the cooling air.
Bearings
This is a double bearing machine, with sleeve bearings at the D.E. and NDE, they have forced oil lubrication with oil coolers, each bearing has its own oil lubrication unit and oil cooler, the oil from the bearing is cooled in a water cooler before being returned to the bearing. This allows reliable lube oil delivery during startup/shutdown and when in turning mode. A filter is fitted to filter the oil and an alarm will be initiated if the filter differential exeeds a programmed value.
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
Should there be a leakage between an inner tube and an outer tube the water wil flow down a small tube to a leakage detector and this will provide an alarm to the system, there are two leakage detectors for each cooling unit, right and left.
If for some reason the cooling water cannot be provided the alternator can run in emergency cooling mode, certain plates and covers are removed to provide circulation of air from outside the alternator and venting of the heated air into the surrounding atmosphere.
The cooler is fitted with a PT100 temperature probe for cooling air temperature,
Space Heater
A 1000W 120V space heater is provided, the contactor for the space heater is interlocked with the VCB of the alternator so as to de-energise the space heater when the VCB closes and to energise the space heater when the VCB opens.
Excitation
The excitation is controlled by an AVR the excitation power is supplied by a permanent magnet generator (PMG) and so it is separately excited. The excitation is supplied to an excitation generator the armature of which is attached to the rotor shaft of the main alternator. A dc voltage is applied to the stationary field windings of this excitation generator and this will cause current to flow and so set up a dc magnetic field. The armature which is attached to the rotor of the main alternator rotates within this magnetic field and an ac current is induced to flow in the rotating armature. This in turn is rectified by a six rectifier three phase rotating rectifier array. The dc current from this is passed to the main alternator’s rotating field windings and this will produce an output at the terminals of the stator windings. This constitutes the three phase output of the alternator.
Any variation in the dc voltage applied to the stationary field windings of the excitation generator is reflected in the three phase ac output of the main alternator and so any variation in the output of the main alternator can be compensated for by a corresponding variation in the dc applied to the stationary field windings of the excitation generator, an increase in the dc voltage will cause an increase in the three phase ac voltage and a decrease will cause a decrease.
Automatic Voltage Regulators (AVR)
With an automatic voltage regulator (AVR) providing the dc to the stationary field windings of the excitation generator, fine control over the output of the alternator is achieved.
The AVR used is a Hyundai HDEC 2000, This AVR detects any fluctuation in the generator’s output and applies correction to the excitation to offset the fluctuation and so keep the output voltage constant. As the AVR derives its power supply and thus the excitation power, from a permanent magnet generator (PMG) and not from the output of the generator via embedded

The generators are located as follows:
No.1 and No.2 in engine room 1 in FZ3, and No.3 and No.4 in engine room 2 in FZ4.
Stator
The stator frame is of welded steel plate design, the stator core is of laminated electrical steel sheet laminations insulated from each other and clamped into a solid core, this is centred into the stator frame and locked against any radial or axial movement. The windings are of two layer coil design and are insulated to class F by integrated mica and enamel coated insulation and then impregnated with cast resin. This provides high dielectric strength and high resistance to moisture, chemicals and aggresive gases, and provides good rigidity and long operating life.
The cooling system consists of an internal fan attached to the rotor shaft, this circulates the air through the machine and provides cooling. In turn this air is directed to the air/water cooling unit where the air is cooled by water filled tubes, it is then redirected to the fan where the cooled air is once again recirculated.
The air to water cooler is a double tube cooler with a slotted plate fins, the water flows through the inner tube and cools the outer tube and slotted fins, the air flows through these fins and around the outer tubes and so is cooled.

auxiliary windings, the supply to the exciter is independent from the main output of the alternator, so any dips in the output voltage of the main alternator due to heavy consumers starting etc will not affect the excitation supply, so the fluctuation in the generator output can be compensated for quickly by an increase in dc volts to the excitation and so a tight control over the voltage output of the main alternator is achieved., it is therefore a separately excited system.
Each generator has an AVR No.1 and No.2 generator’s AVRs are located in the No.2 GPT panel, No.1 6.6kV HV main switchboard panel No.8.
No.3 and No.4 generators AVRs are located in the No.4 GPT panel, No.2 6.6kV HV main switchboard panel No.7.

Insulation Monitoring
A DEIF ADL-111Q96 is used to monitor the insulation resistance of the 24VDC system, it is an insulation monitor specifically designed to monitor dc circuits it is set to 0.1MΩ.
Earth lamps are provided on the panel to detect on which line the low insulation is (positive or negative). The lamp that dims or extinguishes is the one on the faulty line. The faulty equipment has then to be isolated by opening the breaker of each feeder in turn while monitoring the insulation resistance monitor meter and when the breaker of the faulty feed is opened the meter will show high resistance. This should only be done after consultation so as not to compromise the operations of the systems.

3.10 EMERGENCY SWITCHBOARD
Emergency Generator Operating Procedures
The vessel is equipped with one diesel-driven emergency generator. Under normal conditions, the emergency switchboard is supplied from the LV main switchboards. In the event of failure of the normal supply, the emergency generator will start automatically and connect to the emergency switchboard. Interlocks are provided which prevent the emergency generator running in parallel with any of the main diesel-driven generators.
The following procedures are related to the above:
1. Local Manual Control of Emergency Generator From Engine Control Panel (ECP)
a) It is assumed that the emergency generator interlocks are normal and the engine is ready to start.
b) The emergency switchboard mode switch NORMAL/MANUAL/ TEST is set to MANUAL
c) The Mode switch on the generator engine local control panel is set to the LOCAL position.
Manual control of the emergency generator is now available.
2. Manual Control of the Emergency Generator From the Emergency Switchboard
a) It is assumed that the emergency generator interlocks are normal and the engine is ready to start.
b) The emergency switchboard mode switch NORMAL/MANUAL/ TEST is set to MANUAL
c) The mode selection switch on the generator engine local control panel is set to the MANUAL position.
Manual control of the emergency generator is now available from the emergency switchboard.
3. Automatic Control of the Emergency Generator
a) It is assumed that the emergency generator interlocks are normal, the engine is ready to start.
b) The mode selection switch on the generator engine local control panel is set to the AUTOMATIC position.
c) The emergency switchboard generator panel mode switch NORMAL/MANUAL/TEST is set to NORMAL.
IMO No: 9910313 Produced by: WMT Limited, UK

Automatic control of the emergency generator is now available from the CAMS.
4. Automatic Operation: Emergency Generator Start and Connection onto Dead Bus
a) It is assumed that the emergency generator interlocks are normal, the engine is ready to start.
b) The mode selection switch on the generator engine local control panel is set to the AUTOMATIC position.
c) The emergency switchboard generator panel mode switch NORMAL/MANUAL/TEST is set to NORMAL.
d) The main switchboard bus tie breaker opens due to a zero volt situation (blackout).
e) When the emergency switchboard bus voltage drops to zero, the emergency generator engine receives a start command and starts via its electric starter. If the engine fails to start, a start fail alarm is activated.
f) When voltage is established, a check is made to confirm that the emergency switchboard bus voltage is still zero. If this is the case, the emergency generator ACB closes. The emergency generator ACB CLOSED lamp is illuminated. The emergency generator now feeds the emergency switchboard. If the second check on the emergency switchboard reveals normal power has been restored, the emergency generator will run idle until it is stopped manually.

The emergency switchboard supplies all the loads necessary to start up a main generator should a loss of power occur (blackout). It will also supply the vessel’s essential circuits in an emergency situation when the main supply is not available.
Normally, power is supplied from the LV main switchboards to the emergency switchboard via interconnectors.
If a failure should occur in the normal supply then the emergency generator will start automatically and connect directly to the emergency switchboard. Interlocks are in place to prevent the emergency generator from starting and running in parallel with a main generator.
The emergency generator is normally kept in standby mode. The emergency generator may be started for testing and maintenance purposes manually locally and manually at the emergency switchboard. Manual operation may be required in the event of an automatic control circuit failure.
Local manual starting and control of the emergency generator diesel engine is carried out from the engine side local control panel LCP.

3.11 EMERGENCY ALTERNATOR Alternator
Excitation
The excitation system is of the separately excited type. It comprises of an automatic voltage regulator, which samples the output of the alternator and adjusts the excitation accordingly to keep the output as constant as possible. The power supply for the automatic voltage regulator and thus the excitation is provided by a permanent magnet generator. The permanent magnet generator is attached to the none drive end of the rotor shaft. This delivers a steady voltage independant of the main alternator output windings.
The automatic voltage regulator D350 feeds a steady current to the exciter’s stationary winding. This induces a three phase current in the windings of the rotating excitation armature, this output of the excitation armature feeds a three phase revolving rectifier bridge (made up of 6 rectifiers), this in turn supplies a dc current to the rotating field windings of the rotor. The rotating field windings produce a rotating field, this rotating field induces currents into the three main stator windings. The three phases of current induced into the stator windings constitute the output of the alternator.
As the supply to the automatic voltage regulator is not derived from the output of the alternator, therefore any variations of the output due to switching of heavy loads will not effect the supply to the automatic voltage regulator and so a tight control over the output can be maintained.
Space Heater
A space heater of 120V/500W is provided, this is interlocked with the emergency generator. The space heater is thus switched off when the emergency generator is running, when the emergency generator stops the space heater will automatically switch on again.

Under normal circumstances, the control panel is supplied directly from the battery charger output with the batteries being charged simultaneously, if there should be an interruption in the output of this power supply, the batteries would seamlessly take over supplying the engine control panel. When the emergency generator is running, it will supply the control panel via a tapping on its stator winding, this powers an independent power supply.
Engine Control Panel (ECP)
The ECP is an Auto Maksin C Command Elite Plus, this consists of a customer interface box (CIB) which is mounted on the generator set skid. There is a power ON/OFF switch and an EMEGENCY STOP switch mounted on the front panel of the CIB, mouted in the upper part of the front panel is a DCU 410E engine control unit (ECU). The ECU provides all the functions of operating the emergency generator..
Manufacturer AutoMaksin
Model C-Command Elite Plus
The C-Command Elite Plus control panel consists of the following units: • DCU 410E, engine control unit (ECU)
• SDU-410, Safety unit (shut down unit SDU)
• RIO-410, Remote input/output unit (RIO)
The DCU 410E has a color touch screen, this is divided up into three section. At the top is a status bar, this indicated the present status of the generator and any alarms that are extant. The central part is the main screen area. At the bottom of the screen is soft button bar, the soft buttons will have different function depending upon which display has been selected, for example, the MODE soft button will bring up a mode selection screen and the mode of operation can be chosen from there.
The generator engine START and STOP switches can be either latched or unlatched, when latched all that is needed is a single push of the soft switch to start or stop the engine, in the unlatched position the START and STOP switches have to be held down until the engine either starts or stops (it is more usual to have the Start and Stop switches unlatched).
The emergency generator is located in the emergency generator room in the engine casing 2nd level, starboard side in FZ4 between frames 50 and 64.
Description
The emergency alternator is of the separately excited brushless type of conventional design. The stator core being of stamped electrical steel plates insulated on both sides by inorganic resin and clamped together, the whole is mounted in a welded steel frame that provides good rigidity and low vibration. The stator windings are double layer lap wound with 2/3 pitch. The rotor is a 4 salient pole rotor, the cores of the poles being made of electrical steel stampings clamped together with inorganic resin for insulation. The rotor is supported at the none drive end by a high speed low maintenance anti friction ball bearing (6320 2RS/C3).
Excitation is provided by a D350 automatic voltage regulator, the supply for the automatic voltage regulator is provided by a permanent magnet generator this is attached to the main rotor at the none drive end. This therefore is a separately excited alternator. The emergency generator is normally kept in AUTOMATIC mode, this allows automatic starting in the event of a blackout.

Starting the Generator Engine
The normal method of stating is by electrical starting, three attempts are made and if this fails it will attempt to start with the hydraulic starter.
Insulation Monitoring
As the emergency switchboard’s insulation monitor a DEIF SIMQ MkII set to 0.5 MΩ is connected on the emergency generator side of the generator ACB, it will only be operational when the emergency generator is running and connected to the emergency switchboard.
Therefore, if a low resistance alarm is raised when the bus tie between the 450V main switchboard and the emergency switchboard is closed an alarm raised on the insulation resistance monitor of the 450V main switchboard and will not distinguish if the fault lies in the main switchboard or the emergency switchboard. To determine which has the fault the circuit breaker to the emergency switchboard in the 450V main switchboard must be opened. If the fault indication persists, the fault is in the 450V main switchboard, if the fault indication disappears the fault is in the emergency switchboard.
The 120V feeder panel also has a DIEF SIMQ MkII insulation monitor set to 0.5 MΩ.
The No.1 emergency load center panel 120V feeder is equipped with a DEIF AAL-2 insulation monitor set to 0.1 MΩ.

Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
this vessel controls the impressed electrical current automatically to ensure optimum protection. The control unit’s transformer steps down the 440V supply to a low voltage high current AC this is then rectified which produces a low voltage highly controlled DC current. The difference between the hull to reference electrode potential and the set point is amplified. A signal corresponding to this difference is applied to the control circuits of the output thyristors. This causes a corresponding variation in the DC output from the thyristors and the DC protection current is adjusted to the value necessary to provide optimum cathodic protection. The positive output is connected to the anodes and the negative is connected to the ship’s hull. Once it is switched on it operates automatically and needs no other intervention. Sufficient current is impressed via the anodes to reduce the potential of the hull to seawater interface to an optimum level of between 125 and 250mV.
The amount of current supplied, and hence the degree of protection provided, ia monitored via of a vacuum flourescent display on the remote control unit located in the engine control room No.1 in the forward part at frame 85.
The following readouts are provided:
• Cell 1 - Displays hull potential in millivolts measured by cell No.1.
• Cell 2 - Displays hull potential in millivolts measured by cell No.2.
• Shaft 1 - Displays propeller shaft potential in millivolts. Range of operation is 0mV to 250mV.
• Output Volts - Displays the output voltage in VDC. This relates to the total output voltage applied to the hull mounted anodes with respect to the hull.
• Anode 1 Amps - Displays the output current for each anode in amperes DC. This relates to the individual amount of current each anode supplies to the hull.
• Anode 2 Amps - Displays the output current for each anode in amperes DC. This relates to the individual amount of current each anode supplies to the hull.
The display provides the state of the system’s operation, and also the general condition of the immersed hull.. It should be noted, however, that a correct interpretation must include an analysis of the present display readings collectively, and ideally, the present readings should be compared to recorded readings of past performance in order to complete the picture. Thus, it is advisable to maintain a daily record of the system’s operation.
The reference cell potentials indicate the electrical potential of the outer hull. One terminal of the display’s input is connected directly to the hull; the other terminal is connected to a zinc electrode fixed to but insulated from the outer hull. When this zinc/steel assembly is immersed in an electrolyte (such as sea water), a galvanic potential is created. The magnitude of this potential, measured by the computer, varies according to several parameters:

The vessel is provided with an Impressed Current Cathodic Protection (ICCP) system. This system works as a method of corrosion prevention, automatically controlling the electrochemical corrosion of the ship’s hull structure below the waterline. The metals making up the ship’s hull below the waterline are vulnerable to the effect of electrolytic corrosion. Electrolytic corrosion can be compared to a simple battery cell, consisting of two plates in an electrolyte. If these two plates are connected electrically, one of them will waste away through electrolytic action. Sea water acts as an electrolyte, so when two metal plates are immersed in it, one of the metals will act as the anode and will waste away, this is known as galvanic corrosion.
Which metal that acts as the anode and which metal that acts as the cathode depend on their relative positions in the electro-chemical series, steel acts as an anode to copper, or any alloy of copper. The magnitude of the electric current generated in the corrosion cell, and the rate of wastage of the anode depends upon which metals are involved and the concentration of the electrolyte.
This vessel is fitted with an ICCP system. This method of corrosion protection automatically controls electro-chemical corrosion of the ship’s hull structure below the waterline by forcing the steel of the hull to be at a more negative potential than the surrounding sea water.
This is achieved by introducing a current that acts in opposition to the galvanic corrosion current by using electrodes attached to the vessel’s hull providing a source of DC current. This DC current needs to be adjusted so as to provide the correct flow of current, not too little as this will leave the vessel’s hull under-protected and not too much as this will over-protect the hull. To this end, reference anodes are fitted, these detect the potential difference at the hull/sea water interface and the power supply adjusts the current output accordingly. This is the basis of ICCP. For vessels above a certain size, two systems are normally fitted, a forward system and an aft system.
Fresh Water Operation
The resistivity of fresh water is approximately 1,000ohm/cm, significantly higher than that of sea water (25-50ohm/cm). The output voltage will automatically increase to maximum to compensate for this. The system will return the hull to the optimum protection level when the vessel returns to sea water.

Electrical Installation
The power supply unit is connected to two anodes one to port and one to starboard (2 x 100A and two zinc reference electrodes, port and starboard, There is a remote monitoring unit in the engine control room No.1 at frame 85
System Operation
Protection is achieved by passing a low voltage DC current between the hull metal and anodes which have been insulated from the hull, but are in contact with the sea water. The DC current is controlled by the ICCP system’s controller power unit. The electrical potential of the hull is maintained more negative than the anodes, ie, cathodic. In this condition, corrosion is minimised. Careful control is necessary over the flow of impressed current, which will vary with a number of factors including:
• Ship’s speed.
• Salinity of sea water.
• Temperature of the sea water.
• The condition of the hull paintwork.
The zinc reference electrodes tend to maintain a steady hull to reference electrode potential of approximately 400 to 600 mV in normal sea water, the hull being positive with respect to the reference electrode. To provide the optimum amount of protection, the potential between hull and reference electrode must be maintained at approximately 220mV.
If the potential of the hull is made too negative with respect to the anode, damage to the paint can occur through electrolytic action or through the forming of hydrogen gas between hull steel and the paint. The system on

• Temperature
• Availability of oxygen
Utilizing anodes fabricated of inert metals such as titanium, an electrical current is forced or “impressed” through the electrolyte, forming an electrical field on the surface of the immersed steel. As more current is impressed, the steel becomes more cathodic. By controlling the amount of current supplied in such a way as to exactly match the variable amount of current required to maintain an arbitrary hull-potential, any desired degree of cathodic protection may be obtained simply by choosing the corresponding potential value.
Extensive research indicates that the most desirable potential level is about 200mV (with respect to zinc.)
Controls
Most ICCP system controls and indicators are located on the front panel of the Remote Administration Display (RAD) cabinet. The ON-OFF POWER switch located in the upper left-hand corner of the power supply will energize the system by switching on the AC input power, or secure the system by switching off the AC input power.
The auto/manual mode switch and manual output adjust potentiometer are located inside the power unit on the control board AQ-CCB-300A. This switch is normally left in the “AUTO” position. Manual Mode is rarely used and generally reserved for testing.
When Power is Applied
Upon application of power, the system will go into a self test and self cali- bration cycle. The display will indicate, “Survey Network” then “Self Testing - Please Wait.”
The following components are tested during the self test cycle:
• Network
• Controller
• Switcher (power supply)
• Individual anodes
• Individual reference electrodes (cells) • Propeller shaft ground assemblies
At the conclusion of the power-up self test and calibration cycles, the system will regulate output as required to protect the external submerged hull structure. The display will default to the “Summary Display” mode at the conclusion of the self test and calibration cycle.
Summary Display Mode
The Summary Display is the default display mode which will be present most of the time. This display will summarize the status of each zone on the network (a zone will usually consist of one switcher and its anodes and cells). The top line of the display will always indicate the name of the zone to which the summary information pertains. The bottom line will reveal two key areas of performance:
1. System Operational Status
2. Hull Protection Status
System Operational Status messages pertain to the functional capability of the ICCP equipment. If all equipment produces proper test results, the following message will appear: “System Working OK.” If any component has failed the diagnostics, the display will indicate “Fault Detected.” This fault message is followed by the specific fault detected, often with brief instructions to assist in correcting the fault condition.

ICCP Log
There is a log that must have the readings from the control panel entered every day, this is sent off to the manufacturer at the end of each month to be analysed.
Rudder and Shaft Earth Bonding
Due to the fact that the rudder and the propeller shaft is insulated from the rest of the vessel by grease with respect to the rudder and by a film of lubrication oil with respect to the propeller shaft, these have to be earthed to the vessel’s hull separately:
• Rudder: This is achieved by using an earthing strap from the rudder head to a point on the interior of the vessel’s hull (usually the deckhead above the rudder stock).
• Propeller Shaft: The propeller shaft is earthed using an earthing slip ring and brush assembly. The brush is made of high density silver graphite, the slip ring is made of a silver alloy which is clamped to the shaft. This has to be kept clean so that there is always a good contact between the brushes and the slip ring, and thus a good connection. The brushes are connected to an adjacent stud so as to provide a good earth.
The reading displayed on the meter when the vessel is stopped will be 0mV, when the shaft is running it should be &gt;80mV. When the recorded value falls to &lt;80mV the slip ring should be cleaned. There is a section on the log sheet for a weekly entry of shaft earthing readings.

4.1 PROPULSION CONTROL Propulsion Introduction
The vessel is fitted with two propulsion systems, the main propulsion system and the thruster systems. The main propulsion system consists of a fixed pitch propeller driven by two electric variable speed induction motors. The two motors are mounted in tandem on the propeller shaft and coupled directly to the propulsion shaft without gearing.
The electric plant is designed according to the power station principle, meaning that under normal conditions the switchboard works as a common bus bar system. The main propulsion transformers, as well as thruster motors and distribution transformers, are connected to this bus bar.
Each propulsion electric motor system consists of the following equipment:
• A propulsion transformer fed from the 6.6kV main switchboard.
• A premagnetisation transformer fed from the 440V switchboard.
• A synchro-converter providing the variable freqency motor supply from the fixed frequency mains supply.
• One AC synchronous induction propulsion motor.
• Two independent remote control systems with redundant active/ standby configuration.
The 6,600V 60Hz network supply is lowered down to 1,850V by the propulsion transformers and this is the supply to the MV7306 propulsion converters. There is one propulsion transformer with two secondary windings, providing two 1,850V supplies to each converter; this provides a 12-pulse input to the rectifier section of the converter, reducing harmonic distortion.
The converters rectify the 1,850V AC supply to a DC level and this is then inverted to an AC supply with the required frequency for supply to the propulsion motors.
The propulsion plant is designed so that the propeller speed can be precisely controlled to allow maximum efficiency and manoeuvrability. The synchro- converter propulsion drives are designed to provide four-quadrant operation with reversal of torque and direction with continuous speed control from 0 to 100% of rated speed.
The propulsion system can be operated using both or one converter/transformer- motor subsystem. The propeller speed will be limited by the available power when using one subsystem. With both subsystems in operation, the propulsion will remain in operation in the event of a failure of one subsystem.
The operation of the propulsion system is interlocked with the auxiliaries of the shaft line equipment. There is also a dedicated propulsion operating mode for navigation during heavy seas.
SSI / CUI:
The control system has automatic propulsion torque limitation functions to prevent an overload of the diesel generators and possible black-out. The propulsion system is interfaced with the Power Management System (PMS) to regulate propulsion power in accordance with the power plant capacity. The propulsion control system is also interfaced with the Control and Automation System (CAMS).
Control Introduction
This is a single screw vessel fitted with two identical propulsion motor systems, the following descriptions apply to both No.1 and No.2 systems.
The propulsion can be operated with two or only one converter/transformer/ motors in operation.
During normal operation, the two separate converters and control systems constantly communicate via redundant ethernet optic fibre networks and conventional wire ethernet networks, this is mainly to provide balanced load for the two propulsion motors.
The basic concept of this electric propulsion system is to compare a speed reference (speed demand) from one of the control station speed levers (or transmitter dial at the local control stations) and compare it to the existing speed of the propulsion motor(s). If the speed reference is different from the measured speed, then adjustments are made to the speed of the propulsion motors to bring the motor speed in line with the speed setting of the control levers. This is achieved by the speed regulator generating a torque set point that corresponds to the propulsion torque required to increase or decrease the speed of the motor to the required value.
Propulsion Control Stations
The propulsion system can be controlled from any one of the following control stations around the vessel. Each control station has its own priority:
Local control panels (level 3).
• Propulsion converter 1 room (LOC1).
• Propulsion converter 2 room (LOC2). Engine control rooms (level 2).
• Engine control room1 (ECR1).
• Engine control room 2 (ECR2). Wheelhouse and bridge wings (level 1).
• Wheelhouse bridge (WH).
• Port wing (PWG).
• Starboard wing (SWG).
Training bridge (TRN) (level 1).
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
There is a telegraph system fitted with a panel at each remote control station to provide the transmission of speed and direction orders in the event of an emergency or failure of the control system.
The control stations communicate with the propulsion system and each other via duplicated optical fibre ethernet loops. These operate in tandem and so provide redundancy. If there is a failure of one, the other will carry on communication without interruption. The control stations act as the interface between the operator and the propulsion system, each control station having a speed setting lever for each propulsion system (port and starboard).
There are also TFT touch screen displays at each control station and these provide the functions for the following:
• Control of the auxiliaries and their sequential starting. • Control station position selection/changeover.
• Propulsion mode selection/switching.
• Power sequence stop/start.
• Propulsion speed setpoint control.
• Propulsion safeties override (if allowed).
• Alarm and fault handling (acknowledge, reset, etc).
• Alarm, shutdown, slowdown status display.
• Propulsion system status/measurement display/indicators.
The speed setting levers have electrically-driven motorised shafts and are connected by the redundant ethernet optic fibre loop. When the active control station lever is moved, the others will follow the movement and so there is no need to align the lever when a control station is changed over.
Remote Control
The remote control management is carried out in the Propulsion Power Controller (PPC). Only one remote control station can be in control of both propulsion converter/motor subsystems at one time and is classified as the ‘active’ station. The converter local control stations (LOC1/LOC2) control stations are managed in the same way as the other stations, although they are not connected on the remote network. This allows local station availability in case of failure of the remote network and also that the control station switch-over process is identical irrespective of the control station.
The LOC1/LOC2 stations provide system control in ‘standalone’ operating mode utilising directly connections to the converter.
Emergency Control Modes
In the case of a complete remote control system failure, the propulsion can be operated at the converter LOC1/2 panels in Local Emergency mode using the

Local emergency Operation Panel. In this case the emergency telegraph system would be utilised.
Change of Remote Control Station
At each control panel there are ‘CONTROL HERE’ and ‘TRANSFER ACKN’ buttons to take control of propulsion operation or to acknowledge a control request from another control location. When control is requested to be transferred to another station, a buzzer is activated at both stations until the transfer is completed or cancelled.
There are different levels of control priority between the remote control stations and these priorities will define the procedure for taking control. There is no restriction regarding control transfers. The Priority level, from lowest (1) to highest (3) is shown in the control priority illustration:
Take Control with Acknowledgment - Low to High Priority
In the event of a ‘Take Control’ request from the higher priority station, control is immediately transferred from the lower priority active station. Control transfer acknowledgment is required on the former active station to mute the transfer buzzers.
Take Control Via Request - High to Low Priority
In the event of a ‘Take Control’ request from the lower priority station, control transfer acknowledgment is required at the active station before control is transferred to the lower priority station.
Take Control with Request and Acknowledgment - Automatic
In the event of a ‘Take Control’ request from a same priority station, control is transferred with request and acknowledgment. If no acknowledgment is received from the active station, control is automatically transferred after a time delay. A control transfer to a same or lower priority station is only possible when the speed lever of the destination station is aligned with the current speed setpoint to avoid a speed step. When a control transfer is requested to a higher priority station, it is carried out immediately irrespective of speed lever matching.
The remote control station ECR1 is the default control station. In the event of a system startup, remote control is initialised at this station.
In the event of a fault at an active station, the system activates the buzzers at all healthy stations and control can be taken at any healthy station regardless the transfer functions.
Illustration 4.1b Propulsion Control Priority
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
Operating Modes - Speed Mode
Speed mode is the default mode to control the propulsion motors. Motor speed is controlled according to the speed setpoint set by the operator from the active remote control station. Speed control mode is automatically selected at the system startup, when the power control mode is cancelled or in the case of a crash stop. The remote control panels will display the option to select or deselect speed control mode and current speed mode status.
Operating Modes - Power Mode
Power mode allows control of the motors via motor power setting instead of speed. This avoids any large power variations which may affect the generating plant. This mode can be used at high speeds or during heavy sea conditions.
The selected speed setpoint at the active remote control station is converted by the motor control (PECe) into a power setpoint.
When permitted, power mode is selected either automatically by the propulsion system (PPC) when in open sea conditions (speed measurement &gt;66 rpm - 60% of the rated speed) or manually when the operator selects power mode at the active remote control panel. The operator can also select manual or automatic selection of the power mode.
Power mode is cancelled and speed mode automatically selected when power mode is manually unselected by the operator at the active panel. This is also carried out automatically by the by propulsion system (PPC) in the following cases:
• Permanent permissives are not satisfied.
• The speed setpoint is set to below 55 RPM (50 % of rated speed). If the operator wants to decelerate quickly and it is more efficient to control the motor speed.
• Speed measurement &lt;55 RPM for 30 seconds (50% of rated speed).
Power mode selection status is displayed at all the remote control panels.
Starting the Propulsion System
The initial conditions for starting the system are:
• The LOCAL/REMOTE switches on the propulsion transformer panels of the HV main switchboard must be in the REMOTE position.
• The main switchboard CBs must be ready to close, ie, the CB CLOSE AVAILABLE indicators must be illuminated.

Operating Modes - Lever Mode
Lever mode is available at any active remote control panel. When set to this mode, the panel speed lever considered as the ‘Master’ lever and its position sets the propulsion speed set point. This mode is the system default and failsafe mode, ie, if another speed control system fails, control returns to lever mode. All system levers are motorised and will follow the current speed reference, allowing a seamless speed setting changeover when changing control stations. The ‘Lever’ indication is shown at all control stations when this mode is active.
There is a ‘fine’ setting which provides precise speed adjustment (to one rpm).

• There must be sufficient generators running to provide enough power for the vessel’s normal network consumers and for the propulsion system.
When these conditions are met, the converter drives can be started.
Starting Sequences
There are two starting sequences, the auxiliaries starting sequence and the power starting sequence. The auxiliaries starting sequence must be completed successfully before the power starting sequence can be enabled.
Auxiliary Starting Sequence
The auxiliary starting sequence ensures that the system cooling facilities are started and feedback received that they are operating satisfactorily.
Auxiliary start orders are given by the operator from the selected propulsion remote control panel. The PPC controls the starting sequence as two separate sequences (System 1 and system 2). When a starting order signal is given, the auxiliaries will start in a timed sequence so as not to overload the system:
a) The auxiliaries start request is initiated by pressing the AUX ON button.
b) The converter cooling pumps are started.
c) After a delay of two seconds, the propulsion transformer fans are started.
d) After another delay of two seconds, the propulsion motor fans are started.
e) After a further delay of five seconds, an ‘Auxiliaries Started’ indication is displayed.
To stop the auxiliaries, the operator presses the AUX OFF button. The auxiliaries will run for a specific time delay (30 minutes - adjustable) to ensure adequate cooling of the different components. The power sequence must be turned off prior to auxiliaries stopping (permissive).
After the above delay, only auxiliaries designated ‘essential auxiliaries’ will remain in operation. These are one converter pump and one transformer fan and will remain in operation as long as the main switchboard CB is closed.
Auxiliaries - Blackout and Emergency Stop
In the event of a blackout and subsequent recovery sequence, all auxiliaries which were previously running are restarted automatically. The master speed lever is set back automatically to the zero position and the other levers follow via the electric shaft facility. To restore the propulsion, the
operator must press the ‘Power START’ command at the active control station to restart the propulsion motor.
In the case of a propulsion emergency stop, the motor jacking pumps supplied from the emergency network will remain in operation. All the other auxiliaries are stopped for safety reasons.
Auxiliaries - Motor Jacking Pumps
The propulsion motor bearing oil jacking pumps are not controlled as part of the auxiliaries sequence. They are separate to ensure protection of the shaft line which could be damaged by shaft rotation by wake effect. The stopping of these pumps is possible only at the pump local control panels.
Power Starting Sequence
The power starting sequence is the switching on of power to the system, so the propulsion motor is ready to rotate. The power starting order is given by the operator from a propulsion remote panel by pressing the START button.
In certain specific circumstances, the operator can bypass some permissives and override specific faults to enable the power sequence to be started,
The following conditions must be met before the power sequence can be completed:
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
d) The motor speed is referenced and the motor starts and accelerates to the speed setpoint.
Crash Stop Manoeuvre
If the propulsion system is operating in the ahead direction and a full astern is given by setting the speed lever to the FULL ASTERN position, this condition will initiate the crash stop manoeuvre as follows.
a) The speed signal from the control station lever requests a reverse rotation and/or crash-stop manoeuvre.
b) Motor torque decreases following the maximal torque ramp (1pu/s). The speed regulator follows the speed ramp.
c) When the torque is zero, it is maintained at zero and the propeller shaft is in a free wheeling phase (the speed regulator is inhibited).
d) Due to the resisting torque on the propeller, the shaft line speed is reduced down to its trailing speed.
e) The motor torque is inverted when the speed is equal to a speed threshold. This is the braking phase in regeneration mode. Negative power (negative torque, positive speed) is dissipated via the braking resistor.
f) Torque is then limited by the converter torque curve and the braking limitations.
g) The motor frequency is held to 1.5Hz.
h) As soon as the motor can provide an acceleration torque sufficient for the propeller resistive torque, the control system starts the rotation reversing sequence. The motor speed continues to decelerate
i) The propeller reaches zero speed and is then driven in the astern direction. The negative forcing torque is still applied and the motor speed becomes negative. The motor power is positive and the speed increases in the astern direction according to the speed ramp. The negative torque is limited in the astern direction.
The propulsion system exits crash stop mode when one of the following conditions are fulfilled:
First Draft - May 2022 SSI / CUI:
IMO No: 9910313 Produced by: WMT Limited, UK
• The auxiliary starting sequence must have been completed successfully.
• There must be sufficient reserve generated power (two generators connected).
• There must be no alarms/warnings active.
• The bearing jacking systems must be in operation (both motors).
• The shaft line must be free to turn, ie, turning gear disengaged, shaft lock disengaged.
• The speed set point is 0 rpm.
• The propulsion converters are ready.
If all of these conditions are met, then the power starting sequence can when a start power request is initiated:
a) The pre-magnetising contactors are closed and the pre- magnetisation of the propulsion transformers and pre-charging of the converter DC filter capacitors takes place.
b) A close request is sent to the main switchboard propulsion transformer circuit-breakers.
c) The pre-magnetising transformer contactors open.

Local Control Station Keypads
This facility allows the operator to operate the drive in the event of failure of the whole remote control system, ie, no speed lever operation and no control panels. It also allows the reading and resetting of the present fault or faults. It displays the converter main measurements. It is designed as a maintenance and control tool for service engineers and trained technicians. It allows the propulsion system to run with a minimum of security conditions, these are those that only concern the drive itself. Other conditions such as the auxiliaries of the transformers and motors must be operated manually.
The keypad is connected to the propulsion main controller PECe via a RS232 modbus, the keypad being the master.
The Emergency Telegraph
In the event of a major failure in the propulsion control system, an emergency telegraph system has been provided. This is a completely independent system with an independent power supply.
The emergency telegraph system is equipped with a pointer telegraph at the converters and a communication system to indicate orders from the wheelhouse to the selected control station. The system allows an operator located at the bridge (wheelhouse, training, port or starboard wings) to send the speed and direction orders to another operator located in the ECR1/2 or converter rooms.
The ECR1/2 or converter operator uses the LOC1, LOC2, ECR1 or ECR2
These actions are accomplished by the use of hard-wired connections to the emergency stop relay and then the circuit-breakers. A monitoring system is provided in case of a line fault and this will raise an alarm in the ICAS.
Each of the emergency stop pushbuttons has three contacts, two of the contacts are hard-wired to the emergency stop relay of each converter (these are used to trip the circuit-breakers of the propulsion transformers). The third contact is connected to the control panel I/O and will raise an alarm to indicate which emergency stop pushbutton has been activated.
Alarms and Faults Functions
The propulsion control system detects and manages any faults. The faults can be detected by each PECe or the process PLC controllers depending on the location of the fault. When a fault occurs, an alert with different programmed effects is generated, according to the type and severity of the fault - in increasing order of priority:
• Warning.
• Torque limitation.
• Speed limitation.
• Motor stopping (alarm)
• Motor stopping and network CB tripping (alarm).
When a fault occurs, the notification is displayed individually on the alarms mimic and at the control station panels.
Audible Alarms
At local stations, any alarm is signalled by buzzer, if the station is selected. At ECR stations, any alarm is signalled by buzzer even if the station is not selected. At the wheelhouse, training and wings stations, only following alarms are signalled, if the station is selected for control:
• Propulsion alarms - critical.
• Propulsion alarms - with propulsion limitations.
• Propulsion alarms - related to remote control function.
The audible signal is stopped when the alarm is reset or the operator presses the ‘SILENCE BUZZER’ button at the active panelor at the ECR station. Each station has its own silence button which will mute its own buzzer.
The fault reset button is always available at the local and ECR stations, even when the station is not selected for control.
Fault Memory Function
When a failure is detected, the fault memory is set inside the controller (PPC or PECe, depending on the fault) and an alarm is raised on the HMI. The fault
IMO No: 9910313 Produced by: WMT Limited, UK
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
memory must be reset manually to remove the effect. The reset is effective only if the failure (fault cause) has been repaired/cleared. HMI alarms have their own acknowledgement via the HMI and is dedicated to HMI alarm management only. An alert disappears on the HMI supervision when it has been acknowledged and when the fault is reset.
The propulsion control system has self-check facilities and can detect failures of its components, raise an alarm and carry out the appropriate actions.
The PECe and PPC controllers have a monitoring function that checks if the controller’s tasks have been carried out correctly. When a critical task fails, the drive is tripped. When a non-critical task fails, a warning is raised.
Propulsion Shutdown Override
In order to maintain propulsion for critical operations, such as when manoeuvring, specific propulsion effects can be overridden by the operator. Alarm management is carried out so that a sensor failure does not jeopardise the system. This is mainly achieved by monitoring the consistency of the sensor signals delivered (PT100 probes and 4/20mA open circuit detection, etc) and also comparing the measurements and data from other sensors.
The ‘SHUTDOWN OVERRIDE’ function allows the operator to inhibit the safeties of some predefined faults which would otherwise result in a propulsion converter shutdown. This is to keep the propulsion running even if some damage could occur to equipment. These faults are mainly related to the temperatures of the motor/transformer windings and the motor bearings.
In the event of a shutdown override, the function is active for both propulsion sub systems.
A temperature fault is usually raised as a ‘high’ alarm, possibly followed by a ‘high-high’ alarm that would normally result in a converter shutdown. To inhibit the shutdown, the high-high alarm must be overridden before it occurs The Operator is warned at the remote control station panel that it is possible to activate the shutdown override mode. It is then the operator’s responsibility to manually activate the override mode.
All the alarms that can be overridden are configured as ‘shutdown overridable’. Consult the manufacturer’s Fault and Effect matrix documentation for the in-depth list and guide to alarms and faults.
In the above case, an alert with same wording as the alarm, but prefixed ‘INHIB’ in red, is raised but will only have a warning effect. A specific warning ‘New Shutdown Fault Inhibited’ is also raised.

remote control stations, or the converter’s LOP to set the speed setpoint propulsion.
The emergency telegraph system is made up of the following:
• Master telegraph units located in the wheelhouse, training, port and starboard wing locations.
• Slave telegraph units located in the ECR1, ECR2, LOCAL 1 and LOCAL 2 rooms.
The Emergency Stop System
Hard-wired emergency stop buttons are located at each control station.
are also emergency stop buttons on each of the converter cabinets; emergency stop switches stop both drives. The pressing of an emergency stop pushbutton will have the following results:
• A propulsion motor stopping sequence will be initiated.
• The propulsion transformer circuit-breakers will be tripped.
• The propulsion auxiliaries will be stopped with the exception of the motor bearing jacking pumps, these can be stopped manually at their local control panel, if required.

  WARNING
 While the SHUTDOWN OVERRIDE mode is active, all of the ‘shutdown overridable’ alarms are overridden and a converter shutdown will not be carried out when these alarms are raised.

Damage to the equipment could occur if an alarm is overridden.
When activated, the control system will repeatedly remind the operator that the override mode is activated by flashing the background of the ‘SHUTDOWN OVERRIDE’ button for a few seconds, every 5 minutes.
To exit the override mode, the operator must deactivate it manually.
There is one ‘SHUTDOWN OVERRIDE’ button at each remote control panel. When a shutdown override mode can be activated, the background of the ‘SHUTDOWN OVERRIDE’ button flashes on the active remote control station panel.
To activate the shutdown override mode, the operator must press the ‘SHUTDOWN OVERRIDE’ button. The button background is the illuminated.
To deactivate the shutdown override mode, the operator must press the ‘SHUTDOWN OVERRIDE’ button again and the button background will be turned off at all the remote control station panels.
Slowdown Override function
The ‘SLOWDOWN OVERRIDE’ function operates in a similar way to the shutdown override and is fitted to allow the operator to inhibit the safeties of some predefined faults which would result in a propulsion limitation of torque or speed. Again, the slowdown override function, when activated, is engaged for both the propulsion sub systems.
All the alarms that can be overridden are configured as ‘slowdown overridable’. Consult the manufacturer’s Fault and Effect matrix documentation for the in-depth list and guide to alarms and faults.
Power Start Permissives Bypass
At propulsion system starting, when the power sequence is started, it is possible to bypass some start permissives which may be missing if the propulsion is urgently required. the operator has to manually activate actions on the remote control panel, provided the operator has checked the reasons for the alerts. The use of the ‘BYPASS’ buttons enable the ‘POWER START’ buttons to be actioned for a few seconds only. The bypass is automatically cancelled after each power start. The operator can bypass the following start permissives:
• ‘No alert having warning effect’.
• ‘Shaft line free’. In the event of a communication fault or turning gear sensor fault the operator must manually check the turning gear is actually disengaged.
• ‘Enough power to start’. In the event of a communication fault, the operator must manually check that sufficient generating capacity is available.
Operation in Downgraded Mode Jacking Pumps - PPC or I/O Rack Loss
If both redundant PPCs or remote I/O racks are lost, both pumps in each jacking unit will operate by default. The PPC only requests the standby pump to stop.
In the case of a failure of the jacking unit (failure of both pumps or failure of the piping), the shaft line speed should be operated, (until the jacking is repaired, above the speed threshold (55 rpm) where the oil film to lift the rotor shaft in the bearing is self-created. If slowing down has to be carried out before stopping the propulsion, the propulsion should slowdown from 55 rpm to zero rpm in less than 15 minutes before stopping the propulsion. After this, the shaft line should not rotate to preserve the bearing journal.
During blackout, both pumps are sent start requests but only the pump supplied by the emergency network will start and therefore becomes the normal pump. The standby pump (main network supply) will not start. At the end of the blackout, the normal pump remains running and the standby one is stopped.
In the case of an emergency stop, the jacking pumps remain in operation. All other auxiliaries are stopped for safety reasons.
I/O Rack Failure
In the event of system failures, the propulsion system may continue to operate in ‘downgraded mode’. The level of operation in this mode will depend on the specific fault and may consist of warmings, limitations or a shutdown.
The loss of an I/O rack may occur due to an ethernet disconnection or a loss of supply. In this case, this will generate a fault to indicate which rack is faulty. Each I/O rack has watch dog monitoring and in the case of failure, all outputs/ Inputs are reset. The logic is defined to keep the safety of the vessel in case of failure and the final action could be a warning, a limitation or a shutdown, dependent on the fault and its location. For example, if there is a fault on the critical converter I/O rack, the outcome will be a shutdown and trip of the converter. For details of specific racks and the outcome of a fault, consult the relevant manufacturer’s documentation.
Remote Control Station Failure
The possible faults at a remote control station broadly fall into three groups: • Loss of supply or loss of ethernet switch.
• Loss of remote control panel.
• Loss of remote control IO Rack.
If the station was in control at the time of failure, the station will not be operational. The speed setpoint is set at the moment of failure and an alert
IMO No: 9910313 Produced by: WMT Limited, UK
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
signal is sent to the other stations requesting the operator to take control. The emergency stops are hard-wired so will remain active but without indication.
Network Failure
The main networks utilise optical ethernet loops and each device is connected by a network switch unit. Each network switch monitors the operation of the optical fibre links on both sides of the switch. In the case of failure, an alarm is generated and sent to the control system through the remote I/O rack. Information is displayed on HMI system to provide the status of all switches. In case of link failure between two switches, both are displayed in failure. If one link is lost, a warning is displayed on the HMI but there is no effect on the propulsion. If there is a loss of several links or switches, communication is with the I/O rack and the effects will be as per I/O rack failure.
PPC and PECe Failure
The PPC units have built-in redundancy, therefore a single PPC failure has no effect on propulsion. If both PPC units are faulty, both the converter/motors are tripped (the operator can still use the converter LOP in standalone mode). In case of one PECe failure, the associated converter-motor is tripped and the other system will remain operational (single motor operation).
Propulsion Speed - Settings
The propeller motor shaft line cannot rotate between -20 and +20 rpm for an extended or permanent time period. This low speed range is only briefly allowed in transient conditions. The propulsion motors do not have any barred speeds when the jacking units are able to operate. Speed regulation starts as soon as the propulsion is started and the speed setpoint is different from 0 rpm with a dead band of 20 rpm (+/- 18% of the rated speed). The propeller speed is controlled over its entire speed range. If operating with the speed above the 18% threshold and the operator setting the speed lever to 0 rpm, the speed is controlled down to 0 rpm, then the speed control is locked and the torque is released. The shaft line is then free wheeling.
When a speed setpoint is set at the active control station, acceleration and deceleration is carried out using three preset ramps as follows:

A further faster deceleration set of ramps are used in the case of a crash stop.

4.2 PROPULSION LIMITATION SYSTEM
The propulsion system has a comprehensive safety and protection system. This protects the power network and the propulsion system itself from any consequences of irregularities in the system operation. These protection functions are as follows:
• Anti-Overload Limitation (AOLL).
• Anti-Blackout Limitation (ABOL).
Anti-Overload Limitation
The process controller manages this function and receives the following inputs:
• Generator circuit-breaker status.
• Bus-tie circuit-breakers status.
• Current generator operating mode.
• System power measurements.
• Maximum power available from each generator.
• Any tripping intentions that might occur.
These inputs are continuously processed by the process controller to provide limitations or other actions as follows.
Propulsion Limitation by Active Power Overload (PMAX)
The active power measurement of the most heavily loaded generator is taken as a basis for this function. If this measurement becomes higher than the threshold set point (a percentage of the generators rated power), the propulsion torque is limited automatically. This threshold set point is adjustable using the supervision computer (the default value of this set point is 85%, but the minimum value is 60%). The limitation is proportional to measured power set point. This function is active as long as the propulsion is ON and the shaft speed is greater than 20%. A generator is considered to be in service if the circuit-breaker is connected.
Propulsion Limitation by Reactive Power Overload (QMAX)
The reactive power measurement of the most heavily loaded generator is taken as the basis for this function. If this measurement becomes higher than 100%, the propulsion torque is limited automatically. The limitation is proportional to measured power set point. This function is active as long as the propulsion is ON. A generator is considered to be in service if the circuit-breaker is connected. This system response to the activation of this function is 100msec, in addition to any time delay caused by the generator power transducers.
Propulsion Limitation by Reactive Power Overload
The reactive power of the highest loaded DG is monitored by this function. When this measurement is higher than 100%, the propulsion torque is automatically limited. The propulsion limitation applied is proportional to the difference (measurement – setpoint). This function is active when the propulsion power sequence is on. A DG is considered as in service when it is connected (CB closed).
Generator Load Modes
Under normal operation, the connected generators operate under balanced load sharing in ‘Load Sharing Mode’. However, it may occasionally be necessary to reduce the load on one generator for operational purposes.
If a DG is set to DERATING mode, the rated power of the DG has been decreased but the DG is still managed in load sharing with the other DGs by the PMS. The limitation system considers this new rating as the P MAX threshold for that DG while it is derated. The PMS sends a ‘DG in derating mode’ signal to the limitation system.
If a DG is set to FIXED LOAD mode, it is managed with its own power load limit which is different from the limit of the other DGs working in load sharing. The PMS sends a ‘DG in fixed load mode’ signal to the limitation system.
A DG operating in FIXED LOAD mode can also operate in DERATING mode. In this case, PLS considers the new rate d power of the DG.
Anti-Blackout Limitation
This function is designed to prevent blackouts by monitoring the network frequency and voltage levels as follows:
Minimum frequency limitation: The frequency of the main network is checked continuously, if this frequency falls below a certain level of 97.5% of the rated frequency (58.5Hz), this indicates that the connected generators are overloaded (active power). To prevent a blackout, a signal is sent to immediately reduce the power requirements of the propulsion system and an automatic torque reduction takes place.
Network voltage limitation: The voltage of the main network is checked continuously, if the voltage falls below a certain level of 90% of the rated voltage (5,940V, this indicates that the connected generators are overloaded (reactive power). To prevent a blackout, a signal is sent to immediately reduce the power requirements of the propulsion system and an automatic torque reduction takes place.
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
Displayed Information
The following is displayed on the supervision computer HMI screen:
• The active power of each generator.
• The reactive power of each generator.
• The status of each circuit-breaker.
• Propulsion limitation system set points, measurements and limitations.
• Indication of either Pmax or Qmax limitation.
Torque Limitation
Torque limitation is also applied to protect the system equipment from possible damage through excessive mechanical loading. The propulsion limitation system functions as torque limitation as well as other limitations as follows:
• Min/Max network frequency limitation. • Network voltage limitation.
• Propulsion limitation system.
• Sequential limitation.
• Electro-technical limitation. • Process limitation.
The power limitation system has the anti-overload, network frequency and voltage limitations already described and this torque limitation is calculated and applied as a factor to the current torque to reduce it.
Torque threshold limitation includes electro-technical and sequential process limitations. These limitations are predefined thresholds of the rated torque according to each item or equipment. These limitations are applied to the torque demand to limit the propulsion power consumption (or the regeneration during braking phase).
Sequential limitation protects items such as the transformers from possible overheating in the event of cooling equipment faults, etc.
Overspeed limitation is also carried out in the event of the motors overspeeding possibly due to the propeller leaving the water. This protection is applied via system software settings and also via hard signals from the motor pulse generator. The overspeed protection is triggered at three thresholds as follows:
1. 117.7 rpm (107% rated motor speed).
2. 123.2 rpm (112% rated motor speed).
3. 125.4 rpm (114% rated motor speed).
A SLOWDOWN lamp will be illuminated in the event of an active limitation that results in a motor slowdown.

4.3 PROPULSION CONTROL SYSTEM Introduction
Control Stations
The control of the propulsion system is managed from eight control stations as follows:
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
Engine Control Room Control Stations
The engine control rooms 1 and 2 have a touch screen panel and meters for propeller speed and power indication. There is also a single speed lever controller and emergency telegraph unit mounted in the console. There are also EMERGENCY STOP and SILENCE BUZZER pushbuttons adjacent to the control panel, these are hard-wired.
The ECRs also have an HMI supervision PC workstation (WS1 and WS2) that displays the system information and parameters.
Local Control Stations
The local control stations are fitted with a speed transmitter dial in place of a speed lever.
Each local control station has its own touch screen display however, LOCAL 2 station has an HMI supervision PC workstation (WS3).
Propeller speed and power meters, EMERGENCY STOP and SILENCE BUZZER pushbuttons and emergency telegraph units are fitted.
All of the above control stations are connected together by a redundant ethernet optical fibre network and are connected to the drive converter, also by redundant optical fibre ethernet network. They are also connected by conventional ethernet networks.
Each of the speed levers is driven by an electric shaft arrangement; when one is designated the master, eg, the wheelhouse control station, all the other control station speed levers and dials will follow the position of the master allowing a seamless changeover in control location.
The Propulsion Drive Cabinets
The propulsion drive cabinets contain the equipment and systems for the supply of power to the propulsion motors. The converters take the fixed frequency network voltage and convert this to a variable voltage, variable frequency output, suitable for driving the propulsion motors at the required speed:
There are essentially two propulsion control systems controlling two converter/
motor systems. These two systems receive controlling signals from the control
stations and other system inputs from the propulsion controllers. •
• Control of the propulsion motor operation is via speed regulation according to •
a speed setpoint sent from the control station levers. This signal is compared to motor speed measurement calculated from electrical motor measurements, not from direct speed measurement from the encoder (pulse generator).
The speed regulator produces a torque setpoint corresponding to the propulsion torque needed to provide the required speed. The torque setpoint is converted into an active current setpoint providing motor current regulation based on vector flux control.
The propulsion control system consists mainly of the following sub-systems:
• Power Electronic Controller (PECe): providing control of the converter/ motor and anti blackout propulsion limitation. Converter control circuits and inter-connections.
• Propulsion Process PLC (PPC): Management and monitoring of equipment, propulsion operation, interlocks with shaft line equipment, anti-overload limitation, interface with supervision, interface with external systems (CAMS, VDR, etc).
• Supervision: HMI operator interface.
• Remote control: Control stations/human interface for propulsion control.
• Diagnostic/maintenance: Interface with Maintenance and diagnostic PCs and operations.
• Automation networks: network systems to interconnect with all sub-systems.
• An optic fibre ethernet loop communication system.
• An optic fibre remote control ethernet loop system. Two wire ethernet loops, running in tandem for redundancy.
These systems all connect to make up the distributed propulsion control system in such a way that each of the propulsion systems can function together in synchronisation or individually if required.

There are also indicators for speed and power adjacent to the control station. In the wheelhouse and training bridge there are additional larger scale speed and power meters in the overhead consoles.
Wheelhouse Control Station
Most of the switching and indication of the propulsion control are carried out on the touch screen display panel.
There are additional meters for propeller speed and power indication in the wheelhouse console, adjacent to the control panel and further larger displays in an overhead console at the forward end of the bridge.
A single speed lever controller and emergency telegraph unit are mounted in the control station panel.
There are also EMERGENCY STOP and SILENCE BUZZER pushbuttons adjacent to the control panel, these are hard-wired into the propulsion system in case there is a breakdown in the communication between the control panel and the propulsion system.
Bridge Wing Control Station
The facilities at the bridge wings are the same as for the wheelhouse except the large overhead power and speed meters are omitted.

4.4 PROPULSION CONVERTERS
• DCC: DC capacitor section.
• INV: Inverter section.
• ILC: Inverter local control section.
• AC OUT: Alternating current output to motor section.
The mains power supply and motor supply cables to and from the converter are connected to their corresponding bus bars inside terminal units.
The functions of the sections of the converters are as follows:
Process Control Section - PRC
The process control cubicle contains all the control and management modules for the propulsion system. It also contains a 230V AC 1.5kVA UPS for power supply security, the UPS output goes to the CLC section for distribution. The front panel of the PRC also contains the local control panel for the propulsion unit, this includes the following:
• Speed setting dial and reply pointer.
• TFT touch screen.
• Propeller rpm meter.
• Power meter.
• Panel mounted supervision computer, with touch screen.
• Emergency stop pushbutton.
• Silence buzzer pushbutton.
The Power Electronic Controller - PECe
The propulsion motor control is based on a Power Electronic Controller Ethercat (PECe). The PECe is a distributed control system consisting of the following:
• A PECe P80i industril PC.
• A Power Interface Board Ethernet (PIBe).
• Ethernet network for communication and data acquisition.
• A Beckoff I/O low speed data acquisition unit.
The PECe PC is located inside the converter local control cubicle and it manages the following control functions of the converter:
• The speed regulation loop.
• The Anti-Blackout Limitation (ABOL) system.
• The torque regulation loop.
• The flux regulation loop.
• The current regulation loop.
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
• The starting sequence control.
The Power Interface Board (PIBe) is also located in the PRC and has the following functions:
• Produces the trigger pulses for the IGBTs; transmitted to the IGBTs via fibre-optic connections.
• Interfaces for all hard-wired connections required by the PECe, such as measurements and circuit-breaker status. This data is acquired in two ways:
• Fast signals: Input and output signals such as voltage and current measurements.
• Slow signals: Input and output signals connected via a dedicated I/O rack for other data such as circuit-breaker status and water cooling unit interface.
Propulsion Process Controller - PPC
This is an integral part of the control PC PECe and has control over the following functions:
• Starting and stopping of the system auxiliaries.
• Process fault management.
• The Propulsion Limitation System (PLS). This controls the automatic limitation of the propulsion in case of overloading of the main diesel generators.
• The management of the remote control system from the operating positions around the vessel.
• Interfaces with external system or devices such as the Integrated Control and Automation System (ICAS), the Human Machine Interface (HMI) and the Voyage Data Recorder (VDR).
To carry out these functions, the PPC requires inputs and outputs to/from different types of networks as follows:
Optic Fibre I/O Ethernet Network
This network provides communications between the PPC and the remote control positions. Due to the systems loop configuration it is fault tolerant. The propulsion system can be controlled from the eight possible remote control positions that utilise this network:
• Bridge console.
• Port bridge wing console.
• Starboard bridge wing console.
• Training bridge console
• Engine control room 1.

Introduction
The purpose of the converter in the propulsion system is to convert the fixed voltage and frequency of the vessel’s main 6,600V power network into a variable voltage and frequency that is used to drive the variable speed electric propulsion motor.
The converters (also known as a variable frequency drive) take the vessel’s main AC supply, converts it to DC via rectification, then uses Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) techniques to produce a sine wave AC supply of the required frequency. This supply is applied to the propulsion motor, the voltage and frequency of the sine wave determining the torque and speed of the motor.
The converters are pulse width modulated, three level source inverters utilising press pack Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBTs). The IGBTs are power semiconductor devices used basically as an electronic switch to regulate the output motor supply.
Converter Architecture
Each converter consists of the following sections:
• PRC: Process control section.
• CLC: Converter local control section.
• CCU: Converter cooling unit.
• PRE: Pre-charging (pre-magnetising) section.
• DFE: Diode front end section.

Converter Cooling Section - CCU
This section contains the converter cooling pumps and switching system. The cooling of the drive is achieved by a closed loop de-ionised water to fresh (raw) water heat exchanger system.
The system consists of two pumps, one normal and one standby; the normal pump will start during the auxiliaries starting sequence. The water cooling system consists of:
• Two electrically powered pumps; one in normal mode and one in standby.
• A resin de-ionising cartridge.
• An expansion vessel to compensate for changes in pressure. • A de-ionised water to raw water heat exchanger.
• Sensors for monitoring the pressure and temperature.
De-ionised water is pumped through the cooling pipes and ducts of the high voltage sections to provide cooling. This water is then passed through a water to water heat exchanger and the heat from the de-ionised water is dissipated in the raw water. The de-ionised water is also passed on to the cooling pipes to the other HV cubicles. The temperature, pressure and the quality of the de-ionised water is monitored and the following parameters are checked:
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
There is a three-way bypass valve that can regulate the flow of raw water to the heat exchanger if the inlet or outlet temperature is under a set point depending on the ambient temperature, or when the main breaker opens after a time delay, to keep the temperature of the cooling de-ionised water at an optimum level.
The conductivity check is carried out even if the unit is switched off. If a high level of conductivity is detected, a de-ionisation cycle is performed until a satisfactory level is achieved, so the cooling unit is maintained in a ready to start condition in terms of conductivity. If there is not an emergency stop in force, it will be automatically restarted.
Pre-charging Section - PRE
The pre-magnetisation (pre-charging) transformer and switchgear for the pre-magnetising of the propulsion transformer and the DC filter capacitors is located in this section.
Diode Front End Section - DFE
This section consists of the diode font end bridge. This bridge receives the output of the two secondary windings of the propulsion transformer and rectifies this to a DC voltage. The diode bridge is made up of four stacks of six diodes, one stack to each transformer secondary. The output is passed to the DC Capacitor filter circuit (DCC).
Due to the arrangement of the propulsion transformer secondaries, one star and one delta wound, the resulting phase shift is applied to the diode front end, this effectively provides a 12-pulse configuration that ensures harmful harmonics in the system are reduced.
Diode Front End Disconnection - DFED
This section houses the equipment for the disconnection and earthing of the diode front end when required.
DC Capacitor Section - DCC
This section houses the DC filter capacitor banks. These capacitors provide the DC filtering of the rectified AC to remove any residual ripple from the waveform to provide a more stable DC supply. The capacitors are water cooled. During the power sequence they are all pre-charged.
Inverter Section - INV
In the inverter section, the DC from the rectifier section via the DCC section is converted back to AC using pulse width modulation via the IGBTs; these are high power semi-conductor switches that when triggered can switch on and off extremely fast, allowing precise control of the PWM and therefore precise control over the motor speed and torque. The IGBTs are triggered by optical fibre links from the trigger circuits in the PIBe board.

The active pump is started during the auxiliaries starting sequence. The pump is stopped approximately ten minutes after the AUXILIARIES OFF order is given; however, the pump will continue to operate as long as the main circuit- breaker is closed or the DC bus voltage has not discharged.

Output Section - AC OUT
This section contains the connections between the output of the inverter section and the cabling to the propulsion motor.
It also contains a PIBe unit that provides the triggering pulses for the inverter IGBTs and the braking chopper IGBTs.
Propulsion Motor Braking
When the speed of a variable speed motor is reduced by reducing the frequency of the motor supply voltage, energy is fed back into the drive and so the voltage on the DC link will increase. This does not matter for small changes in motor speed, however, for large changes this could be a problem, as the feedback of large amounts of energy into the drive could cause damage.
As this converter system uses a Diode Front End (DFE) (and not an active front end), this energy cannot be fed back into the supply network (regeneration). Therefore, an alternative means of dissipating this braking energy from the motor must be utilised. This system uses a chopper unit and this is connected to the DC link, and when the voltage of the DC link rises above a certain level due to the braking energy from the motor, the chopper unit will activate and feed the excess energy to a braking resistive load - the Braking Resistor Unit (BRU). The braking resistors heat-up rapidly and this heat is then dissipated slowly.
The main component of the chopper unit are IGBTs and these can handle large amounts of energy very quickly, and so this excess energy is dissipated from the drive rapidly. The control for these IGBTs is from the PIBe unit in the AC OUT cubicle, this provides the trigger pulses for both the output IGBTs and the chopper IGBTs. The IGBTs in the chopper unit will switch the excess DC voltage to the braking resistors until such a time as the voltage on the DC link falls to a normal value.
The braking resistor units are installed forward and aft of the associated frequency converter rooms at 4th deck level. The specification of the braking resistors are as follows:
The resistors are made up of grids of stainless steel alloy and these are spot welded together in banks mounted between two end plates, supported both horizontally and vertically by porcelain insulators.
The assemblies are mounted in an enclosed cabinet that is cooled by an air to water cooling unit, the cooling air flow is by natural convection as the hot air from the resistors rises and is cooled by the air to water heat exchanger and the rise of the hot air from the resistors draws in cool air from the bottom of the enclosure. The cooling water is supplied from the propulsion auxiliary fresh water cooling system. The cooler has a water leakage detector fitted and temperature monitoring via two PT100 sensors.
A thermostatically controlled 120V 50W anti-condensation heater is also fitted in the braking resistor enclosure.
The specification of the air to water cooler is as follows:
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
Emergency Converter Control
Each converter is fitted with a Local emergency Operating Panel (LOP) which is directly connected to the power electronic controller PLC.
If the propulsion remote control system fails (a link failure between PPC and PECe, or all remote control stations failed), the propulsion can be operated from the actual converters in ‘Standalone Mode’ using the LOP. This facility is usually for maintenance viar service engineers or trained operators.
local operation allows running of the motor with the minimum security conditions (only those regarding the converter itself) and the operator must check that all conditions are fulfilled to run the equipment properly, (ie, manual start of the required auxiliaries).
At the LOP, the operator can :
• Control the cooling pumps.
• Start the converter power sequence.
• Set a speed setpoint.
• Read/reset faults.
• Read the converter main measurements.
When the standalone mode is selected at the master converter, control is automatically transferred by the PPC to the LOCAL remote control station. So, when the standalone mode is released from the LOP, the control of the propulsion is at the LOCAL remote control station.
If standalone mode is selected at the slave converter, the active remote control station does not change (the slave converter receives its torque setpoint from the master converter).
In standalone mode, the motors can only be controlled in ‘Speed’ mode only, there is no Power mode.

In order to avoid a large energy storage in the braking resistors, the activation of the braking resistors is managed as follows:
• If zero speed or reverse speed is requested, the activation of the braking chopper is restricted to under 40% of full speed.
• In a crash stop situation when:
• Two motors are running, the activation of the chopper is allowed under 50% of full speed.
• One motor running, the activation of the chopper is allowed under 45% of full speed.
In a crash stop situation, the air temperature H and HH limitations are inhibited and only an alarm will be raised.

Construction
The transformer core is made of cold rolled grain oriented electrical steel laminations insulated from each other by a thin resin coating. The laminations have overlapping joints staggered over several laminations. The cutting angles of the joints are 45o, this provides a reduction in no-load losses, no-load currents and also provides noise reduction. The resin coating also provides corrosion protection. The core is clamped into a secure metal frame.
The primary windings are of aluminium foil wound with alternate layers of insulating sheet, bonded together and heat treated. The winding is vacuum cast in resin, to provide insulation and protection from any external influences such as chemicals, chemical vapours, oil and any other contaminants, as well as providing resistance to vibration and mechanical shocks.
The secondary windings are of aluminium foil strips wound with alternate layers of insulating sheet, bonded together and heat treated. The winding is vacuum cast in resin. Copper screens are fittedbetween the HV and LV coils.
The transformer core and winding unit is enclosed in a sheet metal cabinet with the cooler and two associated cooling fans.
Infrared inspection windows are installed in the top cover of the transformers for manual temperature monitoring of the windings and cores with an infrared camera device.
Each transformer has two external junction boxes for the auxiliaries; JB1 for the space heater and auxiliary power connections and JB2 for the PT100 temperature sensor terminations.
The main primary and secondary cables enter the enclosure from the bottom.
Transformer Cooling
The following are the characteristics of the air/water cooling system:
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
It is a closed loop cooling system, the hot air is drawn from the top of the transformer enclosure by the fans and then forced down to the bottom of the cooler unit where it is driven through the water filled tube stacks and cooled. The cooled air is then reintroduced into the bottom of the transformer enclosure. The cooling water is supplied from the propulsion auxiliary fresh water cooling system.
Premagnetising
Each propulsion transformer is provided with a 26kVA premagnetising transformer. The premagnetising transformers are energised before the main supply and will magnetise the transformer before the 6,600V supply is connected, therefore limiting the inrush current. This ensures there is no large voltage drop on the main network when the propulsion transformers are connected. The premagnetising transformers are fitted in the converter.
Alarms, Limitations and Trips
The low voltage secondary windings are equipped with PT100 temperature sensors with two active and one spare for each winding, one of the active sensors supplies an input to the CAMS system and the other supplies the propulsion control system.
There are also PT100 sensors for cooling air temperature. The settings for alarms, limitations and trips are as follows:

There are two propulsion transformers fitted, one for each propulsion converter/motor system. They are situated in the converter rooms on the 4th deck level. Each of the propulsion motor converters is supplied by a propulsion transformer. The propulsion transformers adapt the network voltage (6,600V) to the requirements of the propulsion frequency converters (1,850V).
Each propulsion transformer is equipped with one water heat exchanger and two cooling fans. The cooling fans are started when the AUXILIARIES ON order is received. Each transformer is fitted a standstill heater to avoid any condensation when the transformer is switched off. The heaters are rated 120V, 200W and they are fully automatic and thermostatically controlled. Heater operation is interlocked with the transformer supply circuit-breakers.
The primary winding is delta connected. One secondary winding is delta connected and the other is star connected. This provides a phase shift in one of the supplies to the converter rectifier bridge which reduces harmonics.

The stator core is made up of electrically insulated sheets, braced with clamping bolts and rings and mounted in the stator housing. The stator windings consists of layered coils mounted in the open slots of the stator core. The stator is connected to two terminal boxes on the stator housing. The terminal boxes contain the current bars for connecting the stator cables. The star points are also arranged in two boxes at the front of the housing.
The rotor is comprised of a forged shaft with a shrunk on rotor body. The 10 poles are screwed onto the rotor body.
Motor Bearings
The motor is equipped with self-lubricated, sleeve bearings, equipped with hydrostatic jacking pumps. There are two jacking oil pumps for the drive end bearings and two jacking oil pumps for the non-drive end bearings, normally with one operating and one in standby.
Cooling
The motors are fitted with two air-water heat exchangers providing cooled air which is forced through internal cooling openings via four 440V 9.2kW electric-motor driven fans. This air is then circulated back to the coolers. In the event of a fan/fans failing, it is still possible to operate at a reduced speed.
In the event of failure of cooling water, it is possible to operate the motor with draught ventilation. The motor is provided with emergency air openings in the cooler hood and in the stator housing. The loss of the cooling fans will cause a ‘request for reduction’ signal to be raised via the control system.
After stopping the propulsion motors, the fans will continue to operate for a 30 minute cooling down period.
Each motor is equipped with anti-condensation space heaters. There are two 120V AC 1,650W electrical heaters fitted.
The following temperature monitoring sensors are fitted:
• Embedded resistance temperature sensors in each of the stator windings. There is one in use and one spare in each stator winding.
• Monitoring of internal cold air temperature at the DE and NDE.
• Monitoring of internal hot air temperature
• Monitoring of the two coolers for cooling water leakage.
• Bearing shell temperature at DE and NDE.
If any of the parameters of the monitored points are exceeded, an alarm is raised. If exceeded further, automatic reductions in power or a shutdown.

The two propulsion motors PM1 and PM2 are located at tank top level, PM1 located in motor room 1 and PM2 in motor room 2. They are tandem mounted driving a common propeller shaft which drives the fixed pitch propeller.
The motors are directly coupled to the propeller shaft without gearing and the motors can operate in both directions, the minimum speed of rotation in either direction is XXX rpm.
The motors and shafts are fitted with turning gear and a shaft lock. When either of these two facilities are engaged, propulsion is blocked.
Each propulsion motor is fitted with two pulse generators to accurately measure the position of the rotor. This is for starting and operating the motors. Speed monitoring is from sensors fitted to the toothed wheels on the motor shafts.

Cooling Fan Failures
If one motor cooling fan fails, a non-critical fault alarm is raised.
If two motor cooling fans fail, one from fans 1 and 2 or one from fans 3 and 4, a non-critical fault alarm is raised.
If two motor cooling fans fail, both fan 1 and fan 2 or both fan 3 and fan 4, a critical fault alarm is raised.
If any three motor cooling fans fail, both drives are tripped.
Propeller Shaft
The propeller shaft system is made up of different sections, connecting the propulsion motors to the propeller. The sections of shaft are connected by means of seven flanged couplings secured with hydraulically tightened bolts. The sections are as follows:
• No.1 intermediate shaft.
• No.2 intermediate shaft.
• No.2 motor shaft.
• No.3 intermediate shaft.
• Thrust shaft.
• No.4 intermediate shaft.
• Propeller shaft.
The shaft is supported by eight bearings in order to preserve the alignment and prevent excessive stresses developing. Pedestal bearings are provided for the inboard part of the shaft and a sea water lubricated stern tube bearing is fitted where the shaft passes through the hull. The bearings are as follows:
• Aft stern tube bearing.
• Forward stern tube bearing.
• Thrust bearing.
• Motor 2 aft bearing.
• Motor 2 forward bearing.
• Intermediate shaft bearing.
• Motor 1 aft bearing.
• Motor 1 forward bearing.
An inboard stern tube seal is provided to prevent water from entering the hull. Where the shaft passes through the watertight bulkhead between the two propulsion motors, a bulkhead seal is fitted. A 40mm disc is fitted between the No.2 intermediate shaft and the No.2 motor shaft to enable shaft disconnection between motors/compartments.
To transmit thrust from the propeller to the hull, a thrust bearing is fitted to the shaft. The thrust bearing and shaft pedestal bearings are oil lubricated.
The shaft is provided with an electric motor-driven turning gear which is engaged and operated as required for maintenance purposes. A start blocking system prevents the electric propulsion motor from being started when the turning gear is engaged. A shaft locking system is provided to hold the shaft and prevent rotation; the turning gear can be damaged by the action of water flow on the propeller blades which will cause the propeller, and hence the shaft, to rotate. This locking system is for use in an emergency and prevents rotation of the shaft and propeller should there be a failure of any part of the system, The locking device is also interlocked with the propulsion motor operation.
All bearings have temperature monitoring utilising PT100 sensors
Propulsion Motor Bearing Jacking System
Each motor bearing system has two Lubrication Oil (LO) jacking pumps.
The motor is fitted with bearings which utilise a hydrostatic jacking system for slow speed lubrication. The bearings self-lubricate above 55rpm.When operating at slow speeds (below 55rpm) and when stopped or when ready for starting, the jacking oil pumps operate. The jacking pumps are stopped when the rotor speed reaches 65rpm and the pumps restart at 55rpm.
The bearings are monitored for oil pressure and the jacking units have monitoring for rated oil flow, low oil flow and clogged filter.
• Bearing oil sump temperatures by RTDs, DE and NDE.
• Bearing oil level monitoring by level switches, DE and NDE. • Bearing hydrostatic oil flow by oil flow switch, DE and NDE. • Bearing hydrostatic oil pressure by transmitters, DE and NDE. • Bearing hydrostatic oil filter monitoring, DE and NDE.
The NDE bearing is insulated from the ship’s structure to prevent excess electromotive force transient currents present in the shaft from being transmitted into the bearing. The DE bearing is not insulated. There are shaft earthing brushes fitted at the DE bearing to shunt transient currents to earth.
The propulsion motors, thrust block and shaft bearing lubrications systems are described in the lubricating oil section of this manual.
If a failure or lack of pressure should occur, the propulsion control will switch over from the active pump to the standby pump and an alarm will be raised and displayed. One of the pumps is supplied from the normal supply and the other from the normal and the emergency supplies. In case of blackout, the system switches in the pump that has the emergency feed.

4.7 THRUSTERS Bow Thruster
The thruster unit (known as a ‘Rexpeller’) comprises a four bladed controllable pitch propeller with duct and gear case containing the propeller drive, input shaft, bevel gear and propeller shaft. The steering part consists of spur gears driven by an axial piston type hydraulic motor and swivel column. The spur gear wheel is at the upper end of the swivel coupling and the thruster unit (the propeller part and gear case) is fitted to the lower end. The propeller shaft is sealed against sea water ingress by three lip type sealing rings.
The power from the vertically mounted electric drive motor is transmitted to the propeller through a flexible coupling to the input shaft, lower bevel gears and the propeller shaft. The bearings and gears in the gear case have oil bath type lubrication.
Operation
The thruster is retracted or lowered via the vertical guides. When the thruster is retracted inside of the hull, operation is only as a tunnel thruster. Only when the thruster is extended to its fully lowered position underneath the hull bottom can the thruster be operated through 360° in azimuth thruster mode.
Note: The thruster unit can only be extended or retracted when the ships speed is lower than 3 knots.
Note: When retracted and operated in tunnel thruster mode, operation is limited to a maximum of 30 minutes.
Steering, propeller blade pitch and housing/lowering are carried out hydraulically. There are two separate thruster hydraulic pump units; the 30kw unit is for the steering and controllable pitch functions, the 11kw unit is for the retract and lower functions. These are located in the bow thruster room in zone 1. The systems have a 110 litre gravity tank located in the bow thruster room
The cylinder locking arrangements that secure the thruster in the lowered and retracted positions are pneumatically powered.
When lowered, the thruster can turn in azimuth 180° in 15 seconds. The propeller blade pitch can be moved the full 55° (from +30° to -25°) in azimuth thruster mode in approximately 35 seconds and in tunnel thruster mode in approximately 25 seconds. From the retracted position to the fully lowered position takes approximately five minutes. To retract from lowered position also takes five minutes.
The following interlocks are required to enable drive motor starting:
• Thruster function is ‘Ready to Start’.
• Propeller blade pitch at zero
• Sufficient generating capacity connected.
• Main switchboard circuit-breaker closed.
• Control system power on.

Motor: 440V, 5.5kW, 3,600 rpm
There is one stern thruster fitted in the hull between frames 34 and 36. This thruster is a conventional side tunnel thruster with a controllable pitch propeller. The stern thruster provides an athwartships thrust of approximately 126 kN.
Power is transmitted from the drive motor through the flexible coupling, input shaft and bevel gears to the propeller shaft which rotates the propeller in a constant direction. The bearings and gears in the gear case have oil bath type lubrication. The propeller part consists of four propeller blades, a propeller hub with a hydraulic servomotor and sliding block mechanism. Pressurised oil from the solenoid valve is fed to the hydraulic servomotor through the pipes in the propeller shaft, resulting in the reciprocal movement of the servomotor piston. This piston movement is converted into rotary movement of the blades by the sliding block mechanism.
Controlling the propeller blade pitch is carried out hydraulically from the main hydraulic pump unit. This unit is located in the stern thruster motor room in zone 4. The hydraulic systems have an 80 litre gravity tank located in the stern thruster room. This gravity tank has an automatic thermostatically controlled

The rudder stock is equipped with a stuffing box to seal the steering compartment from the sea.
Power Supplies
Electrical power is supplied to the No.1 steering gear pump from the emergency switchboard, circuit P-ESB-45.
Electrical power is supplied to the No.2 steering gear pump from the No.2 LV switchboard bus no.3, circuit P-LM2-48.
The No.1 and No.2 steering gear control systems are supplied from the No.1 and No.2 steering gear starters respectively.
The oil transfer pump is supplied from the starter for No.1 steering pump.
Hydraulic System
The rudder actuator is supplied from the hydraulic power pack. The hydraulic control valves are located on the actuator. The power pack incorporates two separate pump units and each of these comprise:
• An oil reservoir. • Hydraulic pump. • Control valves.
• Return oil filter. • Oil cooler.
Two separate oil reservoirs are formed by a division plate inside the power pack tank. The division plate does not extend to the top of the tank and so allows overflow between the two reservoirs. The hydraulic pumps are submerged inside the oil reservoirs; each reservoir is equipped with a low level alarm float switch. The oil returning from the actuator also passes through a filter, which is equipped with a differential pressure alarm switch to warn when the filter cartridge requires changing.
Control Valve Unit
Each hydraulic pump delivers oil to a dedicated control valve unit which is mounted on the rudder actuator. The control valve unit acts to regulate the flow of oil from the pump to the actuator according to the steering commands. Each of the control valve units comprise:
• Solenoid operated pilot valve. • Main control valve spool.
• Lock valve.
• Safety relief valve.
• Bypass valve.

4.8 STEERING GEAR Rotary Vane Rudder Actuator
Rudder Actuator
The actuator consists of a cylindrical housing and rotor; stoppers are attached inside the housing and the unit is sealed by end covers which are bolted to the housing. The rudder stock is attached to the rotor and the hydraulic force is transferred to the rudder stock/rudder by means of a frictional connection between the rotor hub and the rudder stock taper. A hydraulic nut is used to pull the rudder stock into the rotor hub. Once installed, the hydraulic nut and lock plate act as a safety device to secure the connection.
There are three vanes on the rotor, which is supported in the housing by two radial bearings, upper and lower, and a carrier bearing. The carrier bearing supports the rotor, rudder stock and the rudder. The bearings are lubricated by the hydraulic oil from the operating system.
The rudder actuator is divided into chambers by means of three stoppers, which are bolted inside the actuator housing. The rotor vanes operate inside the chambers formed by the stoppers. Oil flows into and out of the spaces formed between the vanes and stoppers via passageways in the stoppers. The passageways are connected by two distribution rings which are arranged in the correct formation for actuator operation. The distribution rings connect with the oil supply and return lines, and they are opened and blocked by means of control valves, which are located on the actuator. The control valves are operated by solenoids, which are activated by the steering signals. Internal oil leakage within the actuator is returned to one of the hydraulic power pack reservoirs, via a separate pipe.
The steering gear is normally remotely operated from the bridge. When a steering command is given, one of the solenoids is energised. The solenoid control valve will be activated according to the command signal and the rudder movement will be initiated. The hydraulic control system also incorporates an automatic lock valve. The valve locks the rudder in position until a steering command is received; the valve also protects the steering system in the event that the ‘in service’ hydraulic pump unit fails.
In the event that the remote control system fails, the steering gear hydraulic system can be controlled by manual operation of the actuator control valve.
Electrical limit switches are fitted to the actuator, and these operate to stop the oil supply to the steering gear actuator before the rotor vanes contact the stoppers, providing protection for the unit. The limit switches are located on top of the actuator and they may be adjusted if necessary. Care must be taken when making any adjustments, as incorrect adjustment may result in the rotor vanes contacting the stoppers.
Two potentiometer feedback units are attached to the top of the actuator and these are chain-driven by the rudder stock. The units act to provide feedback and rudder position signals for the control system. A scale is also mounted on the actuator to provide mechanical indication of the rudder’s position.

There is one steering gear, located in ??? at frame xxx; The steering gear is designed to move the rudder through the required 70° with both pumps operating in 14 seconds.
The steering gear system consists of the actuator, hydraulic power unit, an electro-hydraulic control system, and the associated electrical and electronic components. Two pumps supply hydraulic power to the actuator; the pumps may be operated together or separately. At sea in open water, only one pump is normally used, but when manoeuvring or in confined water, both pumps will be operating. A single pump can supply the necessary hydraulic power to develop the specified rudder torque. The pumps are of the screw-type and operate continuously to supply oil to the control valve unit, which directs the oil flow to the appropriate side of the actuator to move the rudder as required.

Steering commands from the bridge are relayed to the control valve units as electrical signals which operate the solenoid valves. When there is no steering signal, the solenoid valve is held in the neutral position by locating springs. The main valve spool is therefore held in the neutral position by springs and the lock valve is kept in the closed position (by springs). With the solenoid valve and main valve spool valve in the neutral position and the lock valve closed, the pump continues to operate, but the oil is returned to the reservoir.
A steering command will energise one of the solenoids and cause the solenoid valve to move in the appropriate direction for port or starboard rudder angle. The hydraulic control oil now moves the main control valve spool. The lock valve is also opened to allow working pressure oil and return oil to flow to/ from the actuator chambers. The oil return from the actuator vent chambers is directed back to the power pack oil reservoir. The rudder is moved and when the required angle is attained, the solenoid is de-energised and returned to the neutral position by the springs. This causes the main valve spool to be returned to the neutral position (by spring action) and the lock valve to close. The supply of oil to the actuator is stopped and the rudder is locked in the required position.
The purpose of the bypass valve is to return oil to the oil reservoir at the beginning of delivery to the actuator; this acts to soft start the delivery process and reduce shock in the hydraulic system. The safety relief valve acts with the bypass valve to return oil to the oil reservoir should the pressure in the hydraulic system exceed preset values.
Local Steering Gear Control
Controls are located in the port and starboard steering gear compartments, which allow the operator to control the steering actuators via electrical signals to the control valve solenoids. Cabinets in each steering compartment incorporate the various electrical systems and controls. The local steering gear control system is described below.
Emergency Steering
In the event that the remote control system fails, the steering gear hydraulic system can be controlled by the manual operation of the actuator control valves. Two levers are arranged on the control valve unit to manually operate the solenoid valve. Local control of the hydraulic pumps must be selected on the pump starter cabinets in the port and starboard steering gear compartments. Procedures for the emergency operation of the steering gear are detailed below.
Note: Emergency steering is effected by the two levers which act directly on the solenoid valve. Only one hydraulic pump unit should be running when using the emergency steering control.
Lock Valve
Should the ‘in service’ pump unit fail and hydraulic oil pressure be lost, the lock valve will close, isolating the defective hydraulic system. The integrity of the rudder actuator is therefore maintained and steering can be continued by
First Draft - May 2022 SSI / CUI:
means of the standby pump. The standby pump unit is automatically started if the operating pump fails.
Relief Valve
In addition to the safety relief valve in the control unit, the actuator is fitted with a relief valve which opens when excess oil pressure exists in the actuator. The relief valve acts to protect the system in the event of a heavy wave hitting the rudder. The force of a wave on the rudder can generate very high hydraulic pressures in the steering gear, and the relief valve allows oil to flow from the pressure side to the vent side of the actuator vanes. The rudder will move, but this produces a feedback signal, indicating that the rudder is not in the position set at the steering control. The control system will now operate and deliver oil to the actuator in order to return the rudder to the required position.
Steering Gear Operation
The steering gear has two modes of operation:
• Follow-up (FU) steering: The rudder moves to the rudder angle set by the operator.
• Non-follow-up (NFU) steering: The rudder moves as long as the steering signal is active.
The steering gear pumps may be started from the wheelhousee, training bridge, ECR or locally from the steering gear room. Prior to leaving port, the steering gear operation should be checked and this should be observed by an engineer in the steering compartment. The results of any checks should be entered in the Engine Room Log Book.
Control of the steering gear from the wheelhouse is described in the bridge operating manual.
Control System Overview
The wheelhouse and training bridge steering gear control system consists of steering gear control, alarm and indication panels. The ECR has alarm and indication panels. The alarm panel and indication panel are fitted with separate sections for each pump unit and the alarm functions are shown on the panel illustration: The steering gear compartment has the motor starters that have a motor controller panel fitted.

The motor controller panel has a control selector switch with the following positions:
• Remote control (steering from the wheelhouse/training bridge). • Stop.
• Local control (emergency steering from the steering gear room).
Author’s Note: Local Motor Controller Detail Required
The normal operating position is REMOTE CONTROL. In this position, start, stop and rudder steering commands are sent from the wheelhouse/bridge. The STOP position ensures that no unintentional start commands are received from the remote positions from the wheelhouse/training bridge during any local tests or maintenance of the steering gear.
LOCAL control is used for steering testing or for emergency operation of the valves, etc. The motor controller operates the steering gear hydraulic pump .
The ‘Power Failure Control’ alarm will be activated when the selector switch is set to the STOP and LOCAL positions as information to the wheelhouse/ training bridge that remote control is not available.
Hydraulic Lock Alarm
Hydraulic lock occurs if the oil cannot flow to and from the actuator chambers. The hydraulic lock alarm is fitted in order to provide a warning that the control unit is locked in either the port or starboard position. The operating pump must be stopped and the standby pump started. If both pumps are operating, the pump unit in which the hydraulic lock has occurred must be stopped.
Alarm Panels
The alarm panels are equipped an alarm ACK pushbutton, a lamp TEST pushbutton and dimmer pushbuttons (+ and -). The alarm buttons have two functions, depending on whether it is pressed once or twice:
• First push: Turns off the local buzzer.
• Second push: Stops the local blinking alarm light. The lamps will show a permanent light if the alarm condition is still present. If not, the alarms will be turned off.
Interface to CAMS
The steering gears are monitored by the CAMS system, via the operator workstation STEERING GEAR mimic. The CAMS has no control over the steering gear. Alarms and rudder/pump status are shown on the mimic screen.
Communication
A talk-back station, a sound-powered telephone and an automatic telephone are installed in the steering gear rooms at the local control positions to allow commands from the bridge to be relayed to the operator. The telephone systems can be seen in the photograph of the local control cabinets.
Rudder Angle Indicator System
The rudder angle indicator must be correctly zeroed when the rudder is in the neutral/midships position. A check must be made at weekly intervals to ensure that the rudder indicators are reading correctly and the angle indicators adjusted as required. Details of the adjustment procedure are given in the manufacturer’s steering gear manual and they must be followed precisely in order to ensure accuracy.

Procedure for Steering Gear Operation from the Steering Gear Compartments
Author’s Note: Ship/Company specific procedure required.
Emergency Control from the Steering Gear Room
Author’s Note: Check below against Ship/Company specific procedure.
Should all the control systems fail (including the local NFU control system), steering capability can be maintained by manually operating the solenoid valves on the hydraulic control units. The selector switch on each of the steering gear motors starter cabinets and the local steering control cabinets should be set in the LOCAL position. The manual operating levers are then unlocked and used to control the rudder via the solenoid valves. The pump operates to turn the rudder in the required direction whilst the solenoid pushbutton is held depressed. Only one pump should be in operation for each steering gear when in emergency control.
In the event of complete failure of the steering gear control system, the steering gear must be operated in emergency manual mode from the steering gear compartment.
a) Establish communication with the bridge from the steering gear room(s).
b) At the steering motor control cabinet, change the selector switch to the LOCAL position.
Note: Operate one steering pump only.
c) At the emergency valves on the hydraulic actuator unit, remove the pin which secures the operating handles. The handles are coloured red and green for port and starboard rudder movement respectively. Using the appropriate handle, press the manual pushbutton on the solenoid valve according to the helm commands. Observe the rudder movement on the scale fitted to the actuator. Release the solenoid pushbutton when the rudder reaches the desired angle.

5.1 MAIN MACHINERY CONTROL
5.1.1 CONTROL, ALARM AND MONITORING SYSTEM
Description of System and Functions
CAMS is made up of standard Digital Processing Units (DPUs) communicating with the central computers through a dual redundant bus network. The DPUs contain the Input/Output (I/O) signal processing cards from the equipment being monitored.
Each OS provides the operator with standard display mimics containing information of the main and auxiliary equipment. Control of any of the DPUs is possible from the OS. The system provides for full monitoring and alarm facilities in the machinery spaces and Engine Control Rooms 1+2 (ECR1+2).
Detailed information from any DPU, such as normal readings or alarms, can be shown on the screen mimics or printed out. The presentation of the data can be a bar graph or a trend curve. The system also displays the latest alarms in each alarm group and all active alarms. Whenever a system measuring point changes, the associated DPU updates the database in each of the OSs, this ensures all the information shown on any OS is always up to date. All of the changes in the measuring points from the DPUs are logged with a time stamp and stored in the OSs for seven days and the readings can be displayed in the ‘Trend’ view. Any recorded alarm events are also time stamped and stored in the operator stations. They are retained for 5 years and can be displayed in the ‘event history’ view.
Communication Network
The OS network is a redundant LAN used for communication between the OPs, and the process area via Segment Controller Units (SCUs). Other PC-based equipment such as printers and switches are also connected to the network. The LAN is an open net using standard protocols (Ethernet, TCP/IP) that permits connection and data exchange using standard Kongsberg software.
Distributed Processing Units
The function of the DPUs is to monitor the analogue and digital sensors and to provide outputs to the different devices in the engine room. There are a number of separate DPUs in the system which meet specific control and monitoring applications.
Process Network
The process network is used for communication between the DPUs in ER1+2. Segregation of the system is by setting up autonomous segments of local systems by using a number of different DPUs. Local systems can be items such as valve control, pump control, power management, propulsion control, cargo control etc. The SCU is used as the gateway to the OS for the various segments to which the DPUs are connected. A redundant Controller Area Network (CAN) bus is used for communication between the DPUs in the process area. Power-link is a communication system for Real-Time Ethernet (RTE). The watch calling system in the accommodation, and public spaces is controlled directly from operator stations through a separate CAN bus.

Introduction
Kongsberg K-Chief 600
The CAMS normally operates on a 230V AC supply to the OSs and a 24V DC supply to the DPUs. Two Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) units are used and are integrated into the system to protect the equipment from supply problems. Each UPS is used to maintain a constant output voltage, and if necessary will isolate the output to a critical load. This helps to keep supply problems from reaching critical systems where they can damage hardware and software, causing the equipment to operate erratically. In the event of a blackout where the incoming mains power is lost, the energy stored in the UPS will continue to provide power to the system for 30 minutes until power can be restored. The UPS supplies also have earth fault detection equipment fitted and any earth fault will be given as a common alarm to the OS.
Operator Stations
The OSs are the main interface between the operator, and the processes being monitored. Each OS has a color monitor and a control panel connected to a desktop computer. OSs are located in ECR1 (OS1~OS3), ECR2 (OS4~OS6), wheelhouse (OS7) + safety centre (OS8). training bridge (OS9) + safety centre (OS10), Chief Engineer’s office (OS11), Deck Training Officer’s office (OS12), engine training spaces 1~3 (OS13~15).
Each OS comprises of a touchscreen control panel which can also be operated by a mouse, connected to a desktop computer and color monitor. The operator stations receive alarms and allow for the control and monitoring of equipment in the system. They display mimic diagrams, allow control of the watch calling system, printing of various logs and interface with the DPUs. The graphic displays are shown on the monitor of the operator stations. These displays show all or part of a system or process using standard symbols to represent the actual plant/equipment (valves, motors etc). Events such as alarms and messages are also shown on the displays. The operator panel is used to interact with the display by the use of the trackball to point and click on the symbols and menus.
The following functions are available:
• Selection and set-up of information to be monitored. • Parameter adjustment.
• Set-up and activation of log printing.
• Alarm display selection and acknowledgement.
• Extended alarm and watch calling functions.
The following screen displays are available: • Mimics.
• List views.
• Configuration displays.
Mimic diagrams and trend curves for the various systems can also be displayed.
The K-Chief 600 Control, Alarm and Monitoring System (CAMS) is a distributed monitoring and alarm system which covers all the important systems on board the vessel and is microprocessor-based. It is designed to provide the ship’s officers with all the basic alarm and status information they require to maintain a safe and efficient operation of the machinery, including when the engine room is unmanned. The basic functions include:
• Process and system monitoring.
• Event logging and monitoring.
The main applications of CAMS to which these functions apply are:
• Alarm/event recording.
• Watch call system.
• Engine room alarm monitoring.
• Primary trend functions.
The Operator Stations (OPs) feature full color graphic displays and functional operator panels.
Ship@Web System
The Ship@Web system is a K-Chief 600 automation system under protection by a local server/firewall. The main server’s role is to be the connection point with external networks requiring information from CAMS. The server will be the host for all the clients, both on the administrative network and on the external shore ship owner Local Area Network (LAN).
External access to CAMS and process LAN needs authorisation from a firewall/gateway connecting to a Virtual Private Network (VPN) solution. This provides the internal network with a high security access level for CAMS, protecting the process LAN from viruses, trojans and other threats from the administrative or external network.
Extended logging of data is included in the Ship@Web system. The data (measuring points)is be stored for one month (the Month log). Data older than one month can be stored for up to 5 years (the Year log). In the Year log, mean values are calculated for groups of measuring points. In addition, maximum and minimum values, and essential events in the data log are stored.

Bridge Watch Extension Alarm Panel
In addition to the main OS panel on the bridge, a bridge watch extension alarm panel has also been fitted and enables the Officer Of the Watch (OOW) to monitor the machinery space alarms when ER1+ER2 are running under Unmanned Service (UMS) conditions.
The bridge watch unit indicates and accepts the transfer of watch responsibility between the bridge and the ECR, but the system prevents the bridge from taking responsibility if no engineer has been selected as the duty engineer.
The duty engineer is indicated by the illumination of the indicator for that engineer on the left-hand side of the panel. Pushbuttons allow the bridge to call the duty engineer or issue an ‘all engineers’ call if required.
Cabin Watch Extension Alarm Panels (Section 5.1.2 Refers)
When the system is selected for UMS operation, the alarms are announced in the cabin of the selected duty engineer and in the public rooms.
There are 14 watch call panels in the accommodation and on the bridge. These units are used to alert staff to any problems when ER1+ER2 is running under UMS conditions. When the bridge has supervision of the engine room watch, an alarm will be displayed on the bridge panel, and on the panel in the cabin of the duty engineer. The alarm will also be displayed on the panels in the public spaces. An audible alarm will sound in the cabin of the duty engineer and in the public spaces and can be muted by pressing the SOUND OFF button on the front of the panel; this does not acknowledge the alarm, as acknowledgement can only be done at one of the OS panels in ECR1+ECR2. If the duty engineer fails to acknowledge the alarm within a set period of time, the alarm will be repeated in all of the engineer cabins and on the bridge.
Peripheral Systems and Equipment
Engineer Safety System
The engineer safety system is part of the alarm and monitoring function of CAMS, and is more readily known as the ‘dead man’ alarm. Panels are strategically placed to assist duty personnel when operating under UMS conditions. Should the ‘dead man’ system not be reset within a predetermined time, an alarm will sound to alert staff.
Printers
The OS stations in the ECR and ship’s office/ballast control room are connected to printers for printing out alarms, events and report printing. Two printers are located in the ECR and two in the ship’s office/ballast control room.
Alarm Block (Inhibit)
Some alarms are conditional and will be inhibited when a specified condition is present. This function is accomplished by defining a signal as an inhibit source for a specified alarm or a specified group of alarms. An adjustable time delay is available to extend the inhibit situation for each signal.
This type of function is set by defining a signal as an inhibited signal for a specific alarm or group of alarms.
An adjustable time delay is available for each signal to extend the blocking facility to prevent activation of certain alarms where there is a time delay between the start of an item and the build-up of temperature or pressure.
Alarm Acknowledgement
It is possible to acknowledge alarms whilst a mimic, alarm group or alarm summary is displayed. Alarm acknowledgement is carried out by pressing the ALARM ACK button.
The SOUND OFF button is pressed to mute the buzzer; pressing the SOUND OFF button does not acknowledge the alarm.
Watch Calling Panels
The watch calling system is the ship’s extended alarm system. The system monitors the cargo, and the engine machinery alarms. Through this system, it is possible to keep the engine control room unmanned (UMS) during normal operation.
Dedicated alarm panels, which are located in various places throughout the vessel, display the alarms and information about the alarm conditions. The watch calling system is made up from a number of self-contained wall- mounted watch call panels, installed at selected locations on the vessel.
The watch calling panel is a touch screen unit, where all functions are available using the menu.

5.1.2 SCREEN DISPLAYS AND OPERATION Introduction
Graphic displays are shown on each of the monitors on the OSs. These displays show all or part of a system or process using standard symbols to represent the actual plant, equipment, valves, motors etc. Events such as alarms and messages are also shown on the displays.
The OS panel is used to interact with the display and control the process which is achieved by the use of the trackball to point and click on symbols and menus.
Display Layout
The screen comprises the following main sections:
• Top Bar. The top bar is the component which is always visible on the screen. It cannot be hidden by any object or pop-up dialog box etc. The top bar provides the operator with full control of the system at all times, and from it the user has direct access to alarm messages, system status, interactive tools and other important system functions. It also contains the following screen buttons:
• VIEW: Contains all commands affecting viewing properties such as display mode, palette synchronisation, brightness and contrast settings.
• OPERATE: Contains operational modes such as mode select, command control and watch call.
• ALARMS: Contains all alarm related functionality.
• TAGS: Contains all the commands related to the sensors, tags and I/O modules.
• TOOLS: Contains commands for measuring, collecting or monitoring data in a way to better interpret the situation.
• SYSTEM: Contains commands related to the general administration of the system and support functions such as access to print, system status, help, change user etc.
• Alarm Bar. This is used to provide easy access to all active alarms in the system.
• Main View Area. This displays a combination of process, tabular, custom, trend, favourite and home views.
• A PROCESS view is the working area for a particular system. System units and parameters can be monitored and controlled from the process view.
• A TABULAR view is a list view which displays system values in a table format with multiple rows and columns.
• A CUSTOM view allows the operator to customise a local working area with his preferred alarm parameters. Up to ten custom views can be populated by the operator.
• A TREND view is used to display recorded and present data for selected alarm parameters. Trend data is logged for a 7-day period.
• FAVOURITE view. Some process views are used over and over again, so to increase operator efficiency, up to nine views can be set as favourite views by the operator. Each view is assigned a number from 1 to 9. The ‘favourites’ bar is located at the bottom of the screen. The bar appears when the cursor hits the bottom of the screen or if the operator presses the 0 button on the control panel.
• The HOME view is used to give the operator direct access to the complete contents of CAMS.
• Navigation Line. CAMS uses an interactive title line for view navigation. All of the views are available from this view navigator. The view title will be displayed, preceded by a trail showing the location of the view in the view hierarchy. Each element in the trail can be clicked to provide a pull-down menu for view navigation, this gives the operator easy access to all of the views in the system and gives the operator quick access to all views at all levels.
• Operator Dialogs. These are displayed in secondary windows on the screen and serve to display information to the operator and to get operator response if needed.
The illustrations provided show typical screen mimics showing the display layout for controlling and monitoring a piece of equipment or process via the OS stations. The large display area is the process display for monitoring equipment, controlling pumps, valves and process values etc. Graphics for a particular process are generally used for providing the necessary overview of the process information along with the display of critical parameters. From the overview graphics, the operator can call up a detailed process screen for any particular piece of equipment or process.
Alarms
Different colors are used on alarms to indicate the alarm’s importance. The use of colors is defined as follows:
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
• Normal Priority Alarms: These are represented by RED colored buttons. A steady red color means all of the alarms have been acknowledged, while a flashing red color means there is at least one unacknowledged alarm present.
• Normal Priority Warnings: These are represented by YELLOW colored buttons. A steady yellow color means all of the warnings have been acknowledged, while a flashing yellow color means there is at least one unacknowledged warning present.
• Low Priority Warnings (Information): These are represented by LIGHT YELLOW colored buttons. A steady yellow color means all of the information warnings have been acknowledged, while a flashing yellow color means there is at least one unacknowledged warning present.
Alarm and Warning Status
Additional information is added to the alarm and warning buttons to show the alarm status as detailed below:
• Flashing color: Alarm or warning not acknowledged.
• Steady color with a tick mark: Alarm or warning has been acknowledged.
• Flashing color with a return arrow: Alarm or warning returned.
If there are more than two unacknowledged alarms in the list, the latest alarm is shown in an extension view. The alarms are sorted by time with the newest alarm on top of the list. The number on the alarm button indicates the total number of unacknowledged alarms in the system.
Alarm Acknowledgement
Every alarm in the system must be manually acknowledged by the operator. All alarm related events are logged in the system and are available for viewing in the alarm history. The system logs all of the alarm events and retains them for a period of 5 years.
There is protection against acknowledging an alarm which appears shortly before the user presses the ACK button. In such a scenario, the user might not notice an alarm before pressing the ACK button. To protect against this, only alarms present in the system for more than 1 second can be acknowledged.
Alarms can be acknowledged in several ways. The most common methods are as follows:

Alarm History View
The alarm history view is used to display the following:
• Active acknowledged alarms.
• Active unacknowledged alarms.
• Acknowledged alarms returned to normal.
• Unacknowledged alarms returned to normal.
• Local time change events.
This is the main view for investigation of the history of all alarm events in the system. The view is event based, so every event has a time stamp in both local and UTC time. The alarm history view holds the last 30 days alarm entries.
Event History View
The event history view presents all digital events logged in the system, such events as:
• Alarm events: Triggered, acknowledged, returned.
• Process events: Start, stop, open, closed, connect, disconnect etc.
• Time change events.
• Tag parameter change events.
• User log-on events.
Inhibit Tags View
To avoid unnecessary alarms, some alarms are conditional and will be inhibited when a specified condition is present. The Inhibit tags view is used to display these alarms.
Overridden Tags View
To avoid unnecessary alarms, some alarms are not checked for alarm situations. The overridden tags view is used to display these alarms. Overriden alarms are highlighted by a light blue background when the alarm tag is presented in a tabular view.
First Draft - May 2022 SSI / CUI:
Process View Layout
The graphical process views are custom made images giving the operator easy to read information about each system and its surrounding equipment; this allows for the control of different process machinery directly from any K-Chief 600 operator station. The process view shows the interconnection of units and instrumentation used to control the process in question. A standard set of static and dynamic symbols are used to present the process.

Introduction
Kongsberg
WCC 600 Watch Call Panel
The extension alarm system will alert the duty officer in the event of any monitored parameter exceeding its set value as monitored by the CAMS. The system comprises a number of self-contained, wall-mounted watch call panels that are installed at selected locations. The panels are controlled from operator stations and are used to warn the bridge and on-duty officers of alarm conditions.
The system has two main functions:
• Alarm Extension: This is a group alarm status and on-duty officer indication facility with a built-in on-duty acceptance, fault indication and test facilities.
• Officer Call: This is an individual and general calling facility for officers that can be activated from selected vessel control locations.
Watch Call Panels
There are two types of watch call panels:
• Watch bridge unit - for use on the bridge.
• Watch cabin unit - for use in cabins and public places.
The alarms will be routed to the engineer on duty as appropriate, for example, deck alarms will be routed to the chief officer when a deck system alarm is activated, and machinery alarms will be routed to the engine room duty engineer.
Panel Functions
• Indicating and accepting the transfer of machine watch responsibility to/from the bridge.
• Call the on-duty engineer at any time - cabin/public spaces.
• Self-check function with system failure indication.
• Buzzer, sound off and test function.
• Alarm summary.
Watch Cabin Unit.
An alarm situation will be presented on the watch call unit with a buzzer sound and a visual indication. The unit will automatically switch to the Alarm Summary page and present alarm information to the user. Configuration of alarms in the system are grouped as follows:
The WCC 600 unit communicates with the main computer in CAMS system using a CAN network.
System Overview
Home Page
Cabin unit home page features:

Common for the settings menu and sub-menus is that the panel exits to display the panel home page after 1 minute of no action in the menu.
System Test Menu
Pressing the SYSTEM TEST button displays a test window. A ‘Buzzer test‘ button allows the user to test the alarm sound. Pressing the button again turns the test off. The user also has the option to use the ‘Sound Off’ soft-button appearing in the top bar to turn the buzzer off.
Configuration Menu
The configuration menu allows the user to carry out temporary changes to the indicators without loading new configuration settings into the panel and is therefore password protected. When pressing ‘Configuration’, a password screen appears, prompting the user to enter the correct password before proceeding into the menu.
The configuration menu is password protected by two user-levels: chief and administrator level. At chief level, the configuration menu contains ‘Labels’ and ‘Screen’ sub-menu. At administrator level, there is a sub-folder named ‘maintenance’ visible. Passwords can be obtained from the manufacturer’s documentation.
About Menu
Three alternatives appear when pressing the About button:
• Version Info: Displays software and hardware versions.
• Legal Info: Displays legal considerations related to the panel. • Unit Status: Displays the current watch call panel condition.
Common Function
The top field of the panel contains additional information. A digital clock is localised in the upper left field. A warning signal and a failure warning button appear if the system has an error condition.
If one or more panels are connected to ‘WCC600 Load’, the tool used to up-load software and configure the panels, text message MAINTENANCE will be displayed on the screen.
If a panel loses communication with the K-Chief OS system, it will give notification after three minutes. The buzzer will sound and the screen will display UNIT FAIL!. The user will be able to use the panel menus while it is disconnected. The home page and warning triangle will remain until the panel has re-established communication with the OS.
Panel Operation
Dimming Menu
This menu selection enables the user to change the screen backlight settings. A ‘glider’ button can be used to adjust the light, or the user can select one of two optional buttons: day or night. The night screen-saver turns off the screen when the panel is not in use or there is no alarm. If the panel is touched while the screen-saver is on, or there is an alarm condition, the screen will be turned on. The night screen-saver function is only used in the panels configured as cabin units.
To increase the backlight without using the slider button, touch the upper left and right side of the panel screen simultaneously and hold down for a few seconds while the panel gets brighter. This can be done in any of the panel views.
Common functionality for all menus:
• Select a field to change the settings.
• Press the X button to return to the previous menu.
• Pressing DONE will return the view to the previous menu.
• The NEXT button allows the user to navigate through the alarms, settings etc.
Responding to Alarms

5.1.4 PATROL CALL SYSTEM
Introduction
Engineer Safety System
The engineer patrol call system, commonly referred to as the ‘dead man alarm’ is an integral part of the alarm and monitoring system. The system provides a safeguard for the duty engineer when entering the engine room during periods of UMS operation. Should the engineer get into difficulties whilst alone in the engine room, the system will indicate to others that an engineer is in the engine room, but unable to operate a response button.
When entering the engine room during periods of UMS, the dead-man alarm should be switched on at the engine room entrance if it has not already been activated via the CAMS. This can be done automatically when the duty engineer has been selected.
Should the system not be reset within a predetermined time, normally 27 minutes, a pre-warning alarm sounds, allowing 3 minutes for the duty engineer to reset the system. If this is not carried out, the UMS alarm system is activated to alert the bridge and off-duty engineers.
UMS Duty
a) Once the duty engineer is selected, the dead-man alarm automatically starts.
b) If an alarm activates during the UMS condition:
• The dead-man alarm system switches on.
• After the alarm is cleared, the duty engineer presses STOP at the engine room entrance when leaving the engine room.
c) During UMS rounds, the engine room reverts to manned service, then back to UMS when the duty engineer leaves.
Note: An alarm can be acknowledged at any time from the light signal column accept button.
Note: The dead-man alarm is automatically armed when a UMS alarm is triggered.

6.1 WATER SYSTEMS
6.1.1 FRESH WATER GENERATOR PLANT Distilled Water Generator
Introduction
A single Distilled Water Generator (DWG) is installed on the floor, port side forward in engine room No.1. It is used to produce distilled water for engine room purposes, and has a capacity of 10 tons/day. The system utilises heat from the No.1+2 MGEs HT cooling water system to generate the water. The ejector, driven by the ejector pump, creates a vacuum in the system to lower the temperature at which evaporation of the feed water can take place. The ejector pump takes its suction from Engine Room 1(ER1) sea water crossover main. The sea water feed is introduced into the condenser section of the distilled water generator. The sea water feed evaporates at a low temperature while entering to the evaporator section due to the vacuum, by the jacket cooling water from the main engine circulating through the evaporator section. The water spray and droplets are partly removed from the vapor by the deflector mounted on top of the evaporator, and partly by a built-in demister. The separated water droplets fall back into the brine, which is extracted by the ejector pump. The resultant distillate is led to the suction of the distillate pump then transferred to the distilled water storage tank.
The water entering the evaporator section is also chemically treated to prevent the build-up of scale and foam inside the evaporator. This maintains efficiency and reduces required maintenance.
A flow meter connected to the distillate pump discharge, monitors the quantity of distilled water produced.
Fresh Water Quality
A salinometer is located on the discharge side of the distillate pump to provide continuous monitoring of the salinity of the distillate produced. If the salinity exceeds the maximum value of 10ppm, an alarm is activated and the water is automatically recirculated back into the fresh water generator separating section.
Main Components
The fresh water generator consists of the following components:
Evaporator
The evaporator consists of a plate heat exchanger which is enclosed in the lower section of the fresh water generator. The heat exchanger is supplied with feed water (sea water) and hot water from the main engine HT cooling water system.
Separator
This separates the brine from the vapour. It houses the separator baffle plate and the demister.

The condenser is located in the upper part of the DWG and consists of a plate heat exchanger which is cooled by sea water entering the DWG. The sea water is used to cool the water vapour from the evaporator, to condense the )vapour, and preheat the feed water. The outlet pipe is branched, and used to feed the evaporator section.
Combined Brine/Air Ejector
The ejector extracts brine and incondensable gases from the separator vessel, maintaining a vacuum.
Sea Water Ejector Pump
The ejector pump is a used to provide sea water to the DWG and driving water for the ejector.
Distillate Pump
The distillate pump extracts the condensed fresh water vapour from the condenser and pumps it to the distilled water tank.
Salinometer
The salinometer continuously checks the salinity of the water produced. If the salinity exceeds a preset value, the water is redirected back into the sea water generator evaporator section.
Chemical Dosing Pump
The feed water entering the evaporator section is treated to prevent the build-up of scale and foam inside the DWG. This aids to maximise performance and reduce maintenance requirements.
Control Panels
Control panels for the salinometer, DWG and pumps are mounted adjacent to the DWG.

Distilled Water Generator Operation
Procedure for Starting the Distilled Water Generator
To operate the DWG, it has been assumed that the No.1+2 MGE jacket water (HT) fresh water cooling system, and MGEs are both operational. The description below assumes that all instrumentation valves are open, the control panels are switched on and the DWG sea water feed pump is being used to supply the DWG. It is assumed that all suction strainers are clear.
a) Open the sea water feed pump suction valve CW041, discharge valve CW042, and overboard valve CW045.
b) At the DWG, open the ejector inlet valve CW043 and outlet valve CW044.
c) Start the sea water feed pump, and create a minimum vacuum of approximately 92%.
d) Open the chemical treatment valve for feed water. Ensure the chemical dosing tank is at a suitable level.
e) Slowly open No.1+2 MGEs jacket water inlet valve HF005 and the outlet valve HF006; the evaporator bypass valve HF007 should be in a fully open condition at this stage, as this is used to regulate the flow of jacket water through the evaporator, and to bypass the evaporator.
f) Adjustment of the jacket water bypass valve HF0017 should be made so that the flow of jacket water through the evaporator gradually increases, and the shell temperature of the evaporator rises above 45 ̊C (113 ̊F).
The boiling temperature in the evaporator will rise, whilst the required vacuum drops to approximately 85%. This indicates that evaporation has started. After a few minutes, the boiling temperature will drop again and a normal vacuum is re-established.
g) Open the valve to the distilled water storage tank.
h) Switch on the salinometer and start the distillate pump.
i) Adjust flow rate from the distillate pump to approximately 18 litres/minute by use of the distillate pump discharge valve.
The DWG distillate pump discharges through a salinometer and a flow meter. Positioned before the flow meter is a solenoid valve. This opens when the salinometer detects too high a salinity level, recirculating the distillate pump output back into the DWG. The discharge from the pump leads to the filling valves of the distilled water tank.

NSMV I
Adjustment of Jacket Water Flow
To obtain the specified flow of No.1+2 MGE jacket water to the DWG, it may be necessary to adjust the bypass valve HF007 until the desired flow is achieved. For maximum output, the outlet temperature of the jacket water from the evaporator should be about 66oC (151oC). It must be remembered that the DWG acts as a cooler for the jacket water, therefore, care must be taken to ensure that No.1+2 MGE jacket water is not under-cooled.
Adjustment of Sea Water Flow
The sea water flow is correct when the inlet pressure at the inlet to the brine/ air ejector is approximately 4.5 bar (65psi) loaded, and 3.5 bar (51psi) ballast.
Stopping the Plant
a) Slowly open the DWG jacket water bypass valve HF007, and slowly close the jacket water inlet valve HF005 and outlet valve HF006.
b) When the distillate output drops below the flow sight glass, stop the distillate pump.
c) Switch off the salinometer.
d) Stop the feed water treatment dosing and close the supply valve from the feed water treatment unit.
e) Stop the sea water feed pump when the shell temperature drops below 40 ̊C (104 ̊F).
f) At the DWG, close the ejector inlet valve CW041 and outlet valve CW042.
g) Open the vacuum release valve (valve 29).
The DWG sea water circuit will need to be fresh water cleaned as required.
h) i)
Close the sea water pump sunction valve CW041, discharge valve CW042, and overboard valve CW045.
Close the valve to the distilled water tank.

deterioration of the membrane. There must always be sufficient concentrate flow to scour the membrane, and carry away the rejected dissolved solids. This will prevent concentrations that would allow precipitation which result in scaling of the membranes.
Reverse Osmosis Operating Parameters
The operator must be aware of the following when operating the RO unit:
• The intake of sea water to the desalination unit is only allowed outside the 5 mile zone.
• The desalination unit cannot treat sea water which is contaminated with oil or other heavy pollutants. For this reason the desalination unit must not be fed with sea water which is suspected to be contaminated by oil or other heavy pollutants. In practice this means that the desalination unit should not be operated when the ship is in a harbour or in the vicinity of a harbour. Nor should the desalination unit be operated when the sea water surrounding the ship is visually polluted, for example close to a river delta where heavy sedimentation is carried out into the sea.
Primary Components
The RO FWG system is designed to produce fresh water from sea water utilising the following primary components in process order:
Multi Media Filter
The Multi Media Filter (MMF) together with a 5 micron automatic filter is part of the pre-filtration package. The MMF comprises a tank which uses a filling of gravel, sand, and zeolite or carbon to a level of approximately 60% full. A basket is mounted at the top of the tank is to prevent washing out the zeolite or carbon during backwash. The feed water flows downstream through the MMF with a low velocity. Solids will settle, and filtering out most of the parts larger than 20 micron. The filter can be back flushed when the maximum differential pressure is reached. The back flushing is carried out with a flow of 1.4m3/h which is limited by a flow restrictor installed in the drain connection.
5-Micron Cartridge Filter
Together with the MMF there is a 5 micron cartridge filter. Both methods complete the pre-filtration package. The 5 micron cartridge pre-filter enables filtration of the system’s feed water down to 5 microns for final protection of the RO membrane element. The 5 micron automatic filtration system is provided to facilitate the removal of sand and zeolite or carbon, and is used to remove smaller and unwanted suspended particles from the feed water.

6.1.2 REVERSE OSMOSIS PLANT Reverse Osmosis Units
Introduction
The Reverse Osmosis (RO) type fresh water generator (FWG) is designed to produce clean and purified fresh water for human consumption as well as delivering to the various utilities found throughout the vessel. The quality of the fresh water produced is in line with the World Health Organisation guidelines for drinking water.
RO is a process for reducing dissolved solids in water. This is accomplished by passing pressurized water over a semi-permeable membrane. The membrane contains numerous tiny holes that allow the water molecules to pass through. The holes are so small that they do not allow most of the dissolved solids to pass through the membrane. These solids and the remaining water (called the concentrate or brine) flow past the membrane surface, and are piped overboard. The water which goes through the membrane is called permeate, or product water.
The output of the RO plant is influenced by the following: • Feed water temperature
• Salinity of the sea water inlet
• Applied feed pressure
Temperature of the feed water can change the output by as much as 50% in the range from nearly freezing to 95°F (35°C). Generally, product flow from RO systems will decrease by approximately 1.5% per °C decrease in feed water temperature unless pressure corrections are made. The capacity of the system therefore may vary seasonally with temperature.
The difference in salt concentration between the feed water and product water also reduces the driving force due to the difference in osmotic pressure, which must be overcome.
The rate at which water flows through the membrane is directly proportional to the driving force available. The driving force is basically the difference between the pressure on the feed water (system pressure), and product water sides of the membrane and the difference in osmotic pressure of the solutions on opposite sides of the membrane. The greater the feed pressure the greater the driving force and product flow rate will be. Increasing the pressure on the product side of the membrane decreases the driving force, therefore lowering the product flow.
The data mentioned above is monitored on a regular basis, producing a standard set of operating conditions. Any reduction in the output is usually related to the operating conditions, and will indicate the amount of fouling taking place on the membrane surfaces.
Most of the solid materials in the feed water will adhere to the membrane if not flushed from the membrane surface and vessel. Eventually, this material will so heavily coat the membrane that all flow will stop. This will result in the rapid

High Pressure Pump
The high pressure pump is used to raise the pressure to the required RO pressure. The high pressure feed pump discharge is fitted with a high pressure protection switch unit. If the low feed pressure switch is initiated the unit will switch off automatically. Also, the pump is fitted with a pulsation damper to ensure pressure fluctuations are minimised.
On startup of the RO unit, the inlet relay will operate, then after a delay, the RO pump relay will operate. The RO unit will continue to run until a condition occurs that causes a shutdown. The can be a normal operating condition or an alarm condition. For either condition, the top line of screen 1 will display the reason for the shutdown. If the condition is due to an alarm, the alarm lamp will flash and the audible alarm will sound.
Reverse Osmosis Membrane
The RO membrane and vessel assemblies are comprised of corrosion resistant vessels, which house the spiral wound reverse osmosis membrane elements. The principle of the reverse osmosis membrane elements is to reject the salt ions present in the feed water, but to enable the potable H2O molecules to flow through the thin membrane surface. A sufficient flow of water across the membrane surface must be continually in progress in order for the correct percentage of salt rejection to occur. Only about 5 to 10% (sea water systems, per individual membrane element) of the system feed water becomes fresh product water. The remainder becomes a concentrated brine solution which carries rejected salt ions away from the membrane element, and back to the feed water source. The proper flow of water is also essential to minimise fouling of the RO membrane element. Reducing the flow of feed water would cause the RO membrane element to recover a higher percentage of the feed water. However it should be noted that any excessive recovery would rapidly foul the membrane. In conclusion, a higher pressure will result in a higher flow of product water. The pressure in the membranes is controlled by a high pressure regulator valve.
Fresh Water Flushing Tank and Pump
Product from the RO unit fills the flushing tank at startup. Once the tank is full, product water is then directed to the FW storage tanks. At shutdown, the flushing sequence is initiated manually, then runs automatically, without further operator intervention. The backwash/flushing water enters the filter from the bottom, and flows through the bed to the top. When backwashing/ flushing the MMF, the backwash water flows in reverse direction through the sand filter, the filter bed is expanded by the flow. The sediment is dragged from the filter media, and becomes suspended again in the water flow. The particles then leave the filter with the backwash water, and discharge to drain.
The freshwater flushing tank and pump are also used for chemical cleaning in place of the RO membranes.
Conductivity Meters
Conductivity meters monitor the quality of the water being produced, and ensure that if the product quality does not meet specifications, the water is diverted to waste. These monitors need to be calibrated on a regular basis to ensure their accuracy.
Fresh Water Chlorination Unit and Rehardening Filter
The RO permeate (fresh water) has an extremely aggressive nature due to the absence of natural inhibitors such a calcium, or magnesium hardness. The pH value tends to fluctuate with a degree of instability due to the absorption of trace amounts of carbon dioxide picked up by coming into contact with air and the fact that the permeate has little buffering capacity.
To ensure the RO permeate (fresh water) required for drinking purposes is acceptable, small amounts of calcium and magnesium is added to improve taste of the product water, and avoid corrosion in the fresh water system. The fresh water is treated in a chlorinator, and a rehardening filter before being directed to the fresh water storage tanks. The dosing of the water by the chlorinator is automatic, and is set depending on the flow of the water. The chlorinator destroys bacteria and sterilises the water which is stored in the tanks. The dolomite rehardening filter produces the correct pH and imparts essential chemical salts to the fresh water, making it fit for human consumption.
Operating Parameters
The operational characteristics of the RO unit are as follows:
• The main switch is located on control box and comprises:
• Mode ‘0’: The power to the control box is switched off.
• Mode ‘1’: The power to the control box is switched on
The operation selection switch has two available modes to operate the RO unit which comprise the following:
IMO No: 9910313
Produced by: WMT Limited, UK Email: manuals@wmtmarine.com
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
• Mode 1 - STAND-BY for maintaining the unit on standby and fresh flush. In this mode the membranes are flushed with fresh water for a short period of time which will protect the membranes and the piping from corrosion during standstill. The fresh water flush will be carried out automatically.
• Mode 2 - OPERATIONAL for fresh water production and is selected to produce fresh water and operates automatically.
Alarms and their Actions
The alarms available are as follows:
• LOW PRESSURE - If the low pressure switch input becomes active for the the delay programmed in the Low Pressure Switch Delay, the unit will shutdown for a low pressure switch alarm. LO PRESSURE will show on the display, the alarm lamp will flash and the audible alarm will sound. The alarm can be reset by pressing the Alarm Silence/Reset key twice.
• HIGH PRESSURE - If the permeate TDS/Conductivity reading exceeds the limit programmed the C2 Limit Setpoint for the delay programmed in the C2 Delay Setpoint, the alarm lamp will light and the HI Cond 2 warning message will show on the display. This warning will clear when the TDS/Conductivity drops below the Setpoint. If the Shutdown warning occurs, after the time programmed in this setpoint, the RO unit will shut down and the alarm will sound. The alarm can be cleared by pressing the Alarm Silence/Reset key twice.
• CONDUCTIVITY - A high conductivity warning can be enabled by programming the conductivity limit setpoint to a value other than 0. If the warning is enabled and the conductivity is above the limit for the time programmed in the delay setpoint, the alarm lamp will light steady and the warning will be shown on screen 2.
A high conductivity shutdown is enabled for a conductivity sensor when the shutdown delay isprogrammed to a delay greater than 0. When the limit is exceeded for the sensor for the shutdown delay,the unit will shutdown for a conductivity alarm condition. The sensor causing the alarm will be shown onscreen 1, the alarm lamp will flash and the audible alarm will sound. Pressing the Alarm Silence/Reset key twice will reset the alarm.
• AUTO RESET - If the pretreat input becomes active and stays active for 2 seconds, the unit will shut down in a pretreat lockout condition. PRETREAT will show on the display, and the unit will remain shut down as long as the pretreat input is active.
• ALARM SILENCE - When an alarm condition occurs, the audible alarm can be silenced by pressing the Alarm Silence/ Reset key once. The condition is not cleared unless the key is pressed a second time. If the Alarm Silence setpoint is

     Note: The pressure across the membrane bank is monitored by high pressure gauges with the membranes and the high pressure pump protected by low and high pressure switches. The low pressure switch protects the high pressure pump from insufficient feed water pressure. The high pressure switch protects the system and the membranes for excessive high pressures.
  CAUTION
  Over pressure will cause damage to the reverse membrane element and under pressure results in low product water production as well as higher salinity content in the product water. Under flow of the feed water into the reverse membrane element will cause rapid and premature fouling of the reverse membrane element as a result of higher than normal recovery (percentage of recovered water to feed water).

programmed to 0, the alarm will remain silenced. Otherwise, the alarm will resound after this delay times out.
• BOOST PUMP CONTROL - If the Aux Mode setpoint is programmed to 1, relay 4 is programmed to operate as a boost pump control. The relay will turn on when the RO starts, and will turn off when the RO stops. If the tank low input becomes active for the time programmed in the Tank Low Delay setpoint, the RO unit will shutdown. TANK LOW will show on screen 1, the alarm lamp will flash and the audible alarm will sound. Pressing the Alarm Silence/Reset key will reset the alarm.
• MEMBRANE FLUSH - If the Flush Type setpoint is programmed to 0, flushing is disabled. If membrane flush is required, several types of flush are available. When the unit enters a flush cycle, the flush relay will activate. The flush cycle will last for the time programmed in the Flush Time setpoint.
• FLUSH MODE - The Flush Mode Setpoint can be used to control the operation of the inlet valve and RO pump during flush. Each can be independently programmed to operate during flush.
Operating Procedures
Start-Up Procedure for No.1 RO Fresh Water Generator
The start-up procedure indicates the requirements in starting the RO unit with delivery to the three potable water tanks (port, centre, and starboard). The procedure is as follows, and will be the same for No.2 FWG:
a) Ensure electrical power is available to the controls and all instrumentation is functioning correctly and there are no system faults. Confirm all alarm conditions are reset.
b) Check and fill as necessary the dosing tank with the prescribed amount of chemical solution.
c) Set the valves of the RO unit in the following position:
Sea Water Feed Pump and Overboard Valves
All valves are prefixed with ‘CW’ unless otherwise advised

Note: At sufficient feed pressure the high pressure pump will start to run after a predetermined (short) period.
j) Confirm that the RO unit is producing fresh water.
k) Monitor the product flow meter, FI01, and the concentrate flow meter, FI02, and the feed pressure gauge PS02.
CAUTION
The feed pressure membrane indicator PS02 must never exceed 1,000
psig.
Shutdown Procedure
Flush Mode
During shutdown the RO unit is flushed with fresh water to protect the membranes.
The freshwater flush system includes a flush/CIP tank and flush pump. Product from the RO unit fills the tank at startup through valve FV01. Once the tank is full, product water is then directed to the fresh water tanks. At shutdown, the flush sequence is initiated manually, and then runs automatically, without further operator intervention.
Manual Flushing
If flushing is enabled, this allows a flush cycle to be manually initiated by pressing the Function key, 2 and the Enter key. If flushing is already active, pressing the Function key, 2 and the Enter key will end the flush.
Procedure for Cleaning the Membranes
The membranes are cleaned by circulating the cleaning chemicals through the membranes by a flush/CIP pump from the flush/CIP tank.
Depending on the process conditions, the membranes can become fouled, which will result in an output decrease and/or a reduction in the quality of the product water, therefore the membrane cleaning procedure is to be implemented. The membrane should be cleaned in the event of the following:
• The product water flow has dropped more than 10% from initial performance.
• The salinity of the product water has increased more than 10% from the initial performance.
• The pressure difference between the feed pressure and the brine pressure has increased more than 15% from the initial performance.
The three phases in this procedure can be distinguished as follows:

• Checking the results of the cleaning.
Prior to commencing the cleaning procedure the following MUST be adhered to:
• Raise a work permit and perform a risk assessment for the procedure.
• Wear the correct PPE with special attention to avoiding contact with eyes, skin and inhalation and using protective clothes, gloves and safety glasses.
Preparation of Cleaning Chemicals Step 1
a) Flush system with copious amounts of fresh, dechlorinated water. This step is to remove all saline water and chemicals from the system and membrane elements.
b) The RO unit and any additional prefiltration equipment such as MMF, should be flushed and sterilized prior to shutdown.
c) Close V01, V02, V03, V04 and V05 at the MMF. Open the concentrate ball valve V13 to the CIP position. Manually open MOV-2. This will allow all product and concentrate to return to the CIP tank.
Preparation of Cleaning Chemicals Step 2
a) Prepare the chemical solution, solution according to the manufacturers mixing instructions.
Cleaning Procedure Step 3
a) Start the cleaning/recirculation pump ensuring that the regulating valve is fully open, and re-circulate for forty-five (45) minutes.
b) During recirculation, visually inspect the condition of the cleaning solution. If the solution becomes very dirty, discard the solution and mix a new batch.
c) During recirculation, the temperature of the cleaning solution will rise. Do not allow the temperature to exceed 35°C (110°F).

Introduction
The distilled/technical fresh water does not require sterilizing, therefore the hydrophore pumps take direct suction from the distilled water tank, and discharge directly to the distilled water hydrophore tank. This tank supplies technical water to all of the equipment in the engine room, and outside deck areas as required.
Distilled/Technical Water System
The distilled/technical fresh water system supplies the following equipment in the machinery spaces, and outside deck areas:
• MGO purifiers operating water.
• Chilled water systems.
• Gray water lift tanks.
• Gray water tanks.
• Waste water mixing tank.
• Bow thruster room fresh water expansion tank.
• Sewage sludge tank.
• BWTS system.
• Sludge pumps priming lines.
• Gray water lift drain tanks.
• Black water lift drain tank.
The stern tube cooling water tank is filled with water from the distilled water storage tank as required.
a) Using the stern tube cooling water tank self-closing test valve SP773 check the level of water in the tank. This valve is positioned 1.000mm (39 inches) above the the shaft center line, and indicates the maximum water level.
b) Assess the quantity of fresh water needing to be transferred to maintain efficient cooling of the stern tube.
c) Confirm sufficient water is available in the distilled water tank then swing the spectacle blank on the supply line to the open position. When ready, open the fresh water supply valve HC800.
d) When the tank has been filled to its maximum level (checked by opening self-closing test valve SP773), close the filling valve and swing the spectacle blank to the closed position.
e) Enter the details of the transfer in the Engine Room Log Book.

6.1.4 WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM Fresh Water Chlorinator
The FW is treated in a chlorinator, and a rehardening filter before being directed to the FW storage tanks. The dosing of the water by the chlorinator is automatic, and is set depending on the flowrate of the water. The chlorinator destroys bacteria and sterilises the water before being stored in the FW tanks. The mineral rehardening filter produces the correct pH, and imparts essential chemical salts to the fresh water, making it fit for human consumption. The minerals in the rehardening filter react with the water’s natural acidity to form a neutral salt, raising the pH value to between 7 and 8
FW is produced by the No.1 and 2 RO FWGs, and is pumped into the FW tanks. From these tanks, the FW is directed to:
• The FW supply system for the accommodation potable water systems.
• The AMR services system.
• Hot water calorifiers
If required, the distilled water system can be cross-connected to the FW system.
If required, the FW storage tanks can also be directly filled from a barge or shore facility using individual deck filling connections. Before filling the FW storage tanks from a barge or shore facility, the water quality must be checked to ensure that it is fit for human consumption.
CAUTION
The vessel’s FW demand is produced by the RO FWGs, although it can be bunkered from a barge or shore facility. FW from a barge or shore facility may not be of the same quality as that produced on board the
vessel and may not have been sterilised.
Fresh water consumers include the following: • Domestic and potable fresh water.
• Grey water tanks flushing.
• Black water tanks flushing.
• Waste water tanks flushing.
There are four FW hydrophore units, two units in No.2 auxiliary machinery room, and two units in No,3 auxiliary machinery room. All four units operate in the same manner where the FW hydrophore tank feed pumps takes suction from the FW tanks.
The duty hydrophore tank feed pump pressurises the hydrophore tank, and will start when the pressure falls to 4.5 bar (65psi), and will stop when the pressure rises to 5.5 bar (80psi). The second feed pump is available as a standby pump should the duty pump fail.
The UV steriliser uses UV light to break down micro-organisms in the fresh water, maintaining it in a sterile condition.

6.1.5 HOT POTABLE WATER SYSTEM IN MACHINERY SPACES
Hot Water Circulation Pump
By continuously circulating the hot water in this way, wastage is kept to a minimum, with water not having to be run off to get hot water at an outlet tap or connection.
Operating the Hot Water System
Assume that No.1 FW tank (P) and No.1 FW tank (S) are to be used, with the other FW tanks being filled/in reserve.
The following procedure assumes that the fresh water hydrophore and the accommodation cold potable fresh water systems are already in use. For each Hot Water (HW) system:
a) Set all of the valves shown in the open position following table: b) Start the hot water circulating pump.
c) Vent the air from the calorifier.
d) Start the calorifier electric heater.

Cold potable water is also supplied to 10 calorifiers where it is heated for use in the domestic hot water system. A calorifier is a thermostatically controlled storage and heating vessel which utilises electricity to provide the heat. The electric heating element are rated between 50~ 134kW, depending on its consumer group. The calorifiers heat the water to 60°C (140°F), but thermostats on the casing can be adjusted to raise or lower this set point. From the calorifier, hot water is circulated around various hot water circuits by hot water circulating pump.

Pump start 5.5 bar(80psi), Pump stop 6.5 bar(92psi) 440V, 11kW(14.75hp), 3,500 rpm
There are four FW hydrophore units, two units in No.2 auxiliary machinery room, and two units in No,3 auxiliary machinery room. All four units operate in the same manner where the FW hydrophore tank feed pumps takes suction from the FW tanks.
The duty hydrophore tank feed pump pressurises the hydrophore tank, and will start when the pressure falls to 4.5 bar, and will stop when the pressure rises to 5.5 bar. The second feed pump is available as a standby pump should the duty pump fail. On the hydrophore pump discharge is a UV steriliser which uses UV light to break down micro-organisms in the FW, maintaining it in a sterile condition.
Assume that No.1 FW tank (P) and No.1 FW tank (S) are to be used, with the other FW tanks being filled/in reserve.
Operating the Hydrophore System
a) Start one FW hydrophore tank feed pump on each hydrophore unit.
b) Fill the hydrophore tank with fresh water to around 75% level.
c) Stop the hydrophore pump.
d) Connect a compressed air supply line to the hydrophore tank, open the air inlet valve until the pressure is 5.5 bar.
e) Close the compressed air supply isolation valve.
f) Repeat steps b) to e) until the tank is at the correct operating pressure, with the water level at approximately 75%.
g) Switch one hydrophore pump to AUTOMATIC operation.

If required, the FW storage tanks can also be directly filled from a barge or shore facility using individual deck filling connections. Before filling the FW storage tanks from a barge or shore facility, the quality must be checked to ensure that it is fit for human consumption.
CAUTION
The majority of the vessel’s FW demand is produced by the RO FWGs, although it can be bunkered from a barge or shore facility. FW from a barge or shore facility may not be of the same quality as that produced
on board the vessel and may not have been sterilised.

b) Check the UV steriliser for leaks. If there are no leaks, start the UV steriliser.
c) Check the operation of the UV steriliser lamps.
Open the drinking water outlet valves at the extreme ends of the drinking water system to allow water to flow through.
When all system water has passed through the UV steriliser, the drinking water system is ready for operation.
During operation of the drinking water system, a check must be made to make sure that the UV steriliser lamps are illuminated.
Note: Backflow preventers are fitted to No.2 and No.4 hydrophore systems to prevent back flow of DW into the FW system should the FW system act as a back up for the DW system.

Gray Water Discharge Pumps
valve which can be opened for filling the companion tank. Galley GW passes through a grease separator before entering the gray water tanks.
Each GW lift station tank is fitted with two electrically-driven, self-priming centrifugal pumps, which discharge to the GW tanks. Starting and stopping of these pumps is controlled by the float type level transmitters. The GW tanks discharge to the waste water mixing tanks.
GW from the galley areas flows via a grease separator to the sewage sludge tank. The grease trap is fitted with and electric heating element, manual cleaning facility and a bypass system fitted with valves.
The galley GW filter discharge pump operates in a similar way to the GW tank pumps. This pump takes suction from the galley grease filter, and discharges to the sewage sludge tank.
Black Water (BW) drains from the hospital flow directly to GW tank 2P, as do the laundry drains.
The GW overboard discharges are located below the water line, aft of the sea water inlet connections, thus there is no risk of contaminated sea water being brought into the ship for use in the FW generators.
Procedure to Operate the Gray Water System
Each GW lift station drain tank has dedicated inlet connections from the collecting manifold from the 4th deck. This tank is then pumped out to the GW tanks. The GW drains from the 3rd deck collecting manifold drains directly to the GW tanks.
The contents from the GW tanks is then pumped to the waste water treatment system.
a) Check that the valves to all instruments and gauges are open and that the instruments and gauges are working.
b) Check that all tank float switches are functional and have been cleaned where that facility exists.
c) Check that there is electrical power available.
d) Open all system pump suction and discharge valves.
e) Open the washing water inlet. Allow the tank to fill until the high level alarm operates. Shut off the fresh water supply. In the case of the grease separator, switch on the electric heating, and drain valves at the grease separator.
f) Check the operation of the discharge pumps; manually start each pump by turning the pump switch to the MAN position for
IMO No: 9910313 Produced by: WMT Limited, UK

a short period of time. Check that both pumps operate correctly, then turn the pump switch to the O (Off) position.
g) Select the discharge pumps for automatic operation by turning the pump switch to AUTO, and set one pump as the duty pump.
h) Open the GW lift station drain tanks inlet and outlet valves.
i) Open the GW tanks inlet and outlet valves.
The GW system is now in service. It should be noted that, as the GW tanks cannot be directly cross-connected to each other. However, each of the GW collecting mains can be crossed connected by opening/closing cross connection valve SD101/SD102.
Air Handling Units (AHUs) drains are led directly to overboard via hydaulically controlled overboard valves (P+S).
GWmimics provide the operator with remote access to system valves. If GW is to be discharged directly overboard, permission must be given by the bridge and discharge is only allowed in designated areas. Discharge valves to the different locations are set manually, only hydraulically operated overboard valves are operated remotely. Normally, GW is discharged to the waste water mixing tanks where it is mixed with black water before being directed to the waste water treatment system
The GW tanks may also be pumped directly ashore. This requires the line valve to the shore discharge at the bunker stations to be open. The discharge hose must be connected at the bunker station after the pipe blank has been removed, and the discharge valve must be opened.
Procedure for Pumping the Gray Water System for Onward Treatment
The GW lift station drain tanks are pumped out using one of the associated GW transfer pumps. The GW transfer pumps take suction from the lift station tank, and discharge into the GW tanks.
a) Check that valves to all instruments and gauges are open and that the instruments and gauges are working correctly.
b) Ensure that there is electrical power available at all relative pumps.
c) Set the valves as in the following table. Normally, GW is discharged to the waste water mixing tank before entering the

The accommodation Gray Water (GW) system collects water from showers, baths and hand washbasins in the accommodation; this GW then falls by gravity to GW lift station drain tanks No.1 and No.2. GW from the helicopter/ cargo deck, and the Ro/Ro space fall by gravity to the ER2 GW lift station No.3 The GW is then pumped out by GW transfer pumps to four GW tanks, two of which are located in AMR1, and two in AMR4.
From the GW tanks, the water may be discharged to the waste water treatment system, overboard, or ashore via the bunker stations. The GW tanks can be flushed with sea water as required. The GW tanks are pumped out by means of the GW discharge pumps. Overboard discharge of GW must be monitored. If a GW tank has to be shut down for maintenance, there is a cross-over

Gray water must not be pumped overboard except in waters where the discharge is permitted. The bridge must always be consulted before any discharge of gray water.
Procedure to Discharge Gray Water Ashore
GW may be transferred ashore by the GW transfer pumps. Before any transfer takes place, agreement must be reached with the shore reception facility regarding the quantity of water to be discharged, the pumping rate, and the quality of the water. The GW transfer pumps from the individual GW tanks are used to discharge into the GW transfer line, and the valves set so that the selected bunker station to be used receives the water flow.
The shore discharge connections are situated at the bunker stations on the port and starboard sides of the ship at deck A level. There are two discharge connections at each bunker station, each having a valve; the discharge connections are fitted with a blanks.
The shore connection pipe should be connected to the shore discharge pipe at either the port or starboard bunker stations and the bunker station valve opened. The other bunker station valve must be confirmed as closed and blanked.

6.2.2 BLACK WATER VACUUM UNITS Vacuum Collection Unit
Manual Operation of Sewage (Vacuum) Pumps
Manual mode is a totally manual operation with no automatic operation in this mode. Manually turn all pumps MAN-0-AUTO switch to 0 and then by turning one or both pumps to MAN, the built-in vacuum generation logic is by-passed. A pump(s) selected to run in MAN mode will be operating until stopped by the operator.
Process Alarms
The control panel alarms are reset by pressing the control switch ‘ALARM RESET’. The common alarm contact is open when at least one alarm is activated. If a new alarm is activated whilst common alarm contact is already open, contact first closes for 5 seconds’ and then opens again to indicate, that new alarm is activated.
Purpose of the Vacuum Collection Units
The reduced pressure in the vacuum unit ensures that waste from lavatory pans flows quickly, thus ensuring rapid evacuation of the pans and associated pipework. A number of individual lavatory pans connect with a downcomer and a number of downcomers connect with a header supplying the vacuum unit. Vacuum is maintained by the duty vacuum pump. The BW is removed from the collecting unit by gravity unit to the BW tank. A BW discharge pump may also pump the black water overboard (where permitted) or ashore via the bunker stations, depending upon the setting of discharge valves.
The vacuum pumps are normally selected for AUTO operation at the local control panel, and they will operate automatically to maintain the vacuum in the collection pipes and the level in the collection tank respectively.
The collecting units, BW tanks, waste water mixing tanks, and waste water treatment plants are vented separately at the top of the funnel.

Black Water System Line-up
Collection and transfer units are set locally for automatic operation. The vacuum unit maintains a vacuum in the collecting line. Each BW collection unit is identical and all operate in the same way.
a) Ensure that valves to all instruments and gauges are open and that the instruments and gauges are operating correctly.
b) Ensure that all accommodation lines are operational.
c) Ensure that electrical power is available at the sets.
e) If the unit has not been operated for some time, flush through the main connecting line to the vacuum ejectors and the tank system with non-potable water.

The Black Water (BW) collection pipes from the accommodation are connected to two separate vacuum collecting units, each unit having connections from different parts of the ship. No.1 vacuum collection unit serves Fire Zone (FZ) 1, and No.2 vacuum collection unit serves FZ 3 and 4. The outlet lines from No.1 and No.2 vacuum collection units are cross-connected which allows BW to be directed to either BW tank due to maintenance requirements.
Each vacuum collection unit has sufficient capacity for all zones it may be called upon to serve. The vacuum collection units have two vacuum pumps, for generating the vacuum, the BW collected by the unit flows by gravity to its associated BW tank. Normally, one vacuum pump is are set to operate and the second is on standby.
Automatic Operation of Sewage (Vacuum) Pumps
Manually select the pump MAN-0-AUTO switch to AUTO. The sewage pumps starting and stopping pre-set setpoints are -40kPa to -60kPa. at the vacuum manifold. When vacuum level drops to -40 kPa, the first pump starts to generate vacuum. Stopping set point of the vacuum pump is at -60 kPa. If the vacuum pump does not meet the required vacuum level within 10 seconds, the second vacuum pump will start to generate vacuum. Both pumps shall run until the stop point -60 kPa is reached. If the vacuum level drops to -20 kPa, both pumps will start immediately generating vacuum.

Ensure that each vacuum collecting unit is operational with the BW line valves to the collecting manifold open so that all associated areas are served. Cross- connection valves with the other collecting unit should be closed, and the inlet valves to the collecting unit from the collecting manifold must be open. The vacuum pump valves must be open. The BW discharge pump valves will be opened as required when pumping overboard/ashore. To prevent accidental discharges overboard/ashore, valves to the overboard discharge, and the shore connections at the bunker station must be closed.
Before a BW collecting unit is put into operation, it is necessary to check the functioning of the BW tank level switches, and level alarm. The operation of the vacuum pumps must also be checked.
The sewage BW collection systems are now ready for operation.
Operating of the Black Water Collection System
BW will be collected by the BW collecting units, and each will discharge BW by gravity into the BW tank.
The sewage collection system will normally be monitored and operated via its local control panel, but it is necessary to check the operation of the system visually at daily intervals in order to ensure that there are no leakages.

All personnel involved with the operation of the sewage collection and treatment plant must be conversant with the contents of Black Water Collecting System Regulations to satisfy Safe Return to Port requirements.
The BW collecting and transfer system is fitted with a number of Safe Return to Port valves which enables the system to be separated should a critical SRtP condition exist. These valves are clearly identified in AMR4 with red tags. Valves should be closed/opened as required in order to ensure that BW collection is available in the ship even with engine room compartments not functioning. Engineering staff must know the location of SRtP valves in the machinery spaces and these valves should be test opened/closed at intervals to ensure that they are able to function in the event of a SRtP condition.

The sewage treatment plants process both BW and GW as a sewage mixture. This mixture is created in the sewage mixing tank from where it is pumped into the sewage treatment plant. The GW and/or BW is transferred into the sewage mixing tank to create the sewage mixture. When the filling level in the sewage mixing tank reaches a predefined level, the feeding pump of the sewage treatment plant starts to operate, and the treatment process is initiated.
Maceration
The sewage mixture from the sewage mixing tank is first run through a macerator to chop up solid and fibrous components.
TSS/COD/BOD Reduction
The sewage treatment plant separates the suspended solids (TSS), reduce the chemical (COD), and biological (BOD) oxygen demand. The sewage is enriched with air under a pressure in the saturator. After being discharged into the flotation tank through the pressure release valve, the excess air forms micro bubbles. A flocculant is added in order to let air bubbles, and suspended particles form larger flakes. These flakes float upwards, creating a sludge foam on the surface, leaving the clear phase in the lower part of the flotation tank. The sludge foam spills into the sludge compartment, which is subsequently fed into the sludge tank.
Disinfection
The largely purified sewage is finally exposed to UV radiation to degrade the DNA of bacteria and micro organisms, rendering them incapable of reproducing and causing infection. After this finishing step, the treated sewage from the sewage treatment plant is safe to be discharged overboard (if permitted).
Process Description
GW and BW is collected in holding tanks. When the filling level reaches a predefined level, the sewage treatment starts automatically. The feeding pump (A-1-P-050) starts to operate, and is protected from running dry by process water. The pump transfers raw sewage from the BW holding tank via the macerator (A-1-Z-080) to the saturator (A-1-B-030). The macerator (A-1-Z-080) in the suction line reduces the solids in the raw sewage to 1 mm pieces. The sewage is agitated with 5 bar air pressure through membrane air diffusers in BW holding tanks AMR1 and AMR4. AMR1 BW holding tank has 28 membrane diffusers, AMR4 BW holding tank has 18 membrane diffusers. The pressure sensor at the saturator (A-1-CP-062) measures this pressure in the saturator, with the required pressure in the saturator being controlled by the pressure release valve (A-1-H-004).

Treatment Process
The sewage enriched with air is discharged from the saturator through the pressure release valve, and loses its pressure. The excess air forms bubbles, and a flocculant is added.
Flocculant and air bubbles connect to the suspended particles of the sewage, and form larger flakes in the flotation tank (A-1-B-031). This reduces the total density. Flakes, particles, and other impurities are lifted out by their buoyancy. This creates a sludge foam on the surface of the flotation tank, and leaves the clear phase in the lower part of the flotation tank.
The clear phase pump (A-1-P-150) operates throughout a predefined period to maintain the operation level in the flotation tank. The clear phase pump then stops. This allows fluid and sludge foam to build up in the flotation tank. The sludge foam spills over the brim of the flotation tank into the sludge compartment (A-1-CL-260).
When the sludge foam in the sludge compartment reaches the level sensor in the sludge compartment, the sludge pump (A-1-P-250) starts to run. This pump transfers the sludge from the sludge compartment to the sludge tank. The cleaning nozzle, flotation tank (A-1-A-480) in the upper area cleans the sludge compartment.
At the same time, the clear phase pump (A-1-P-150) starts to operate again to maintain the operation level. The cycle in the flotation tank begins again. The level sensor in the flotation tank prevents the clear phase pump from running dry.
The particles collected in the sump of the flotation tank can be drained manually via opening the 3-way sludge valve, (A-1-V-201).
UV Disinfection
The clear phase pump transfers the clear phase from the lower part of the flotation tank through the UV disinfection plant (A-1-C-180). The clear phase passes through the UV lamps where the UV light degrades the DNA of bacteria, and micro organisms which makes the bacteria, and micro organisms incapable of reproducing. The treated effluent is now safe to discharge overboard.
System Shutdown in Standby Mode
When the filling level of the holding tank falls below a defined stop level, the sewage treatment plant enters the standby mode:
• The macerator and the feeding pump stop.
• The clear phase pump continues to operate until the flotation tank has been drained to its stop level.
• The pressure of the saturator is released. The liquid filling level of the saturator is drained into the flotation tank.
First Draft - May 2022 SSI / CUI:
NSMV I
• All pumps stop operating and the sewage treatment plant is on the standby mode.
The plant remains in the standby mode until the filling level of the holding tank reaches the start level. When the sewage treatment plant is shut down via the touch panel, the plant carries out the steps to enter the standby mode.

drain any oil that should have entered this section. The valves should be opened in turn until all of the oil has been removed, but immediately closed as soon as water has started to flow. Each section of the tank is also fitted with a drain valve.
Waste Oil Tank No.2(P)
The waste oil tank No.2(P) has a capacity of 34.5m3, and is used to collect the drains from the oily water separating tank, starting air and air receiver drains, and No.2 control air compressor drains. This tank is emptied by No.2 sludge pump to the incinerator sludge oil mixing tank for buring in the incinerator. Also, this pump can discharges the contents ashore when the vessel is in port via the bilge shore connection manifolds.
Clean Bilge Tank
The clean bilge tank contents are normally discharged overboard via the oily water separator. The tank is fitted with a high level alarm and indicator and a low level switch that operates to stop the oily water separator pump. If necessary, the contents of the bilge holding tank can also be pumped ashore when in port using No.2 bilge house keeping pump.
Operating Engine Room 2 (Aft) Bilge System
No.2 bilge house keeping pump is used to pump out the contents of the bilge wells in ER2, MR1, and MR2. This pump discharges to the oily water separating tank where the oil and water is separated by gravity to either the clean bilge tank or No.2 waste oil tan.
The procedure that follows has assumed the aft bilge well is to be pumped to the bilge primary tank.
a) Sound and record the level in all bilge tanks.
b) Ensure all of the bilge well suction strainers are clean and ready for use.
c) Check all of the instrumentation is working correctly.
d) No.2 bilge house keeping pump valves in accordance with the following table.
The valve settings have assumed the suction is being taken from the aft bilge well, but if other bilge spaces are to be pumped, the appropriate valves must be opened.

In addition to these, the bilge main can also take its suction from the following void spaces:
• Void spaces in stern P and S.
• Void spaces under MR2 x 4.
• Void spaces under MR1 x 4.
• Void spaces 12C and 13C under ER2.
• Void spaces 11C under ER1.
The stern tube cooling water tank is fitted with a self-closing overflow valve. The outlet point in the stern tube tank is located above the shaft centre line. The valve can be quickly opened to confirm there is water in the tank for stern tube bearing cooling purposes. The stern tube cooling water tank is pumped out by No.2 bilge housekeeping pump.
The port and starboard bilge wells in the steering gear room, and port and starboard stores bilge wells are drained to the aft bilge well with self-closing drain valves.
High level alarms are fitted to the bilge wells and voids in the engine room, and to the bilge wells in the steering gear compartment. They all operate through the AMS.
The No.2 bilge housekeeping pump is used to empty the bilge wells in the ER2 bilge system, and No,1 bilge housekeeping pump is used to empty the bilge wells in the ER1 bilge system. Both of these pumps discharge into the oily water tank. These pumps can also discharge the bilge water to shore connections if required.
Oily Water Separating Tank
The oily water separating tank is used to collect the bilge water and drains from the machinery spaces, and to initially separate oil and water by two internal weirs before being treated in the oily water separator.
The tank has three compartments which are divided by two internal weir plates. The weirs allow water to flow from the bottom of the inlet section to the top of the middle section, then from the middle section to overflow to the discharge section of the tank. The oil/water mixture entering the inlet side separates, with the water passing through the bottom of the weir plate to the middle section, then overflowing to the discharge section. The water then flows from the discharge side to the clean bilge tank under the action of gravity. The oil that remains inside the oily water tank can be drained using a manually operated scum valve that allow the oil to flow to the waste oil tank. One scum valve is located on the outlet section of the tank, and one on the discharge section to

Operating Engine Room No.1 (Forward) Bilge System
No.2 (aft engine room), and No.1 (forward engine room) bilge systems are cross-connected through valves BS041/040 for discharge to the oily water separating tank, details of the this are described above.
No.1 bilge house keeping pump is used to pump out the contents of the bilge wells in ER1, AMR4, AMR3, AMR2, and AMR1. This pump discharges to the oily water separating tank where the oil and water is separated by gravity to either the clean bilge tank or No.1 waste oil tank.
The pumping procedure will be the same as that for ER2 bilge system, but using No.1 bilge housekeeping pump.
The procedure that follows has assumed ER1 port aft bilge well is to be pumped to the oily water separating tank.

Description Valve
The forward bilge system includes those bilge wells located in the bow thruster room, and bosun's locker.
Bowthruster Room Bilges
This bilge system is pumped out using a fire main driven eductor rated at 10 m3/h. This eductor discharges directly overboard via the bowthruster fresh water cooler overboard valve. To operate the system open firemain drive water valve BS088, and either bilge suction valves BS086, or BS087.
Bosun's Bilges and Chain Lockers
This bilge system is pumped out using a fire main driven eductor rated at 5 m3/h. This eductor discharges directly overboard via the port hawse pipe via valve BS080. To operate the system open firemain drive water valve BS089, and suction valves BS083 for the port chain locker, BS082 for the bosun's store bilge well, or BS081 for the starboard chain locker.
Pumping Oily Bilge Tank No.2 to the Shore Connections
In this procedure it has been assumed the OWS has been switched off, and isolated, and No.2 ER bilge houskeeping pump is being used for this task.
The remaining bilge discharge valves should be arranged in accordance with the following table:

Empire State Bridge Operating Manual
This partially-cleaned bilge water is supplied to the process pump for processing by the SPIROLATOR membranes. The process pump increases the partially- cleaned bilge water pressure, and drives the emulsions across the surface of the membranes at a high velocity. Water, salts and detergents are forced through the membranes by pressure created by the system pumps, and operating pressure control valve, while oils and other waste larger with larger molecular weight are rejected. The portion of the semi-cleaned bilge water forced through the membranes is referred to as the processed water (clean water, oil content less than 10 ppm) while the remainder is referred to as the concentrate. The system is equipped with an oil content monitor, which continuously monitors the processed water for oil content. If the oil content exceeds the alarm set point the processed water will automatically be re-directed for re-processing. If below the alarm set point, the processed water is discharged from the system. The system is constantly being replenished by bilge water supplied by the feed pump. The concentrate with the rejected oils, and waste is fed back to inlet of the process filter, for further de-oiling and polishing before being returned to the process pump inlet for reprocessing through the membranes. This circulation loop process allows for a higher velocity flow rate across the membranes which maximizes the processed water output by minimizing fouling due to the higher velocity shearing off excess oils, and waste from the surface of the membranes. A small portion of this circulation loop is continuously bled off to the oily bilge tank, where this concentrated oils/sludge can be further coalesced before being reprocessed through the full process of the OWS. The process flow rate (system inlet rating) is equal to the OWS processed water flow (overboard) plus its circulation loop’s bleed flow (return to oily bilge tank).
The OWS processed water, circulation loop, and bleed flows are factory set that can be manually checked for verification. Pressure transmitters are fitted to monitor operating conditions. A flush sequence is fitted to automatically flush the membranes with clean water periodically at each automatic shutdown of the system. A flush may be performed manually at any time. During either automatic or manual membrane flushes, the clean water is introduced to the circulation loop for a short duration of time, and pumped across the membranes by the process pump to displace the loops concentrate, and return it to the oily bilge tank where it can be reprocessed.
An electric heater is fitted to the OWS to improve the initial separation process, but the heater will only operate when the separator is filled.
Oily Water Separator Operation
After obtaining permission from the Chief Engineer, and before arrival at the destination port, the contents of the clean bilge tank are to be emptied using the OWS to make space for the stay in port. The Chief Engineer is to confirm the position of the vessel from the bridge before starting operation of the OWS. The padlock and security seals should then be attached to the overboard discharge valve on completion of the pumping operation.
When the OWS is not in use, the OWS overboard valve is to always be kept padlocked and the key is to be kept under the strict custody of the Chief Engineer. A log is to be kept when the valve is opened.

6.3.2 OILY WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM Oily Water Separator
Stage 1
Incoming bilge water passes through a basket strainer to remove oversized solid contaminants. From there it is drawn into the first stage consisting of a coalescing OWS where the free oil droplets coalesce as they pass through the permanent matrix. This oil rises to the top of the vessel, and it is collected for discharge during the oil discharge cycle. The water is then drawn through a pack of oleophillic polishing beads, which trap the remaining fine oil droplets. These oil droplets are washed out and discharged during the oil discharge cycle.
Stage 2
Processed water from the OWS is then directed through a particulate filter, which further reduces solids contamination. This semi-treated water is then fed into the process pump; this pump increases the flow, and pressure for suitable conditions for the SPIROLATOR membranes. The SPIROLATOR membranes are oil-repellent, which prevent oil and oily-emulsions from passing through. A rejection stream is re-circulated back for re-processing.
Process Flow Description
The bilge water to be processed is drawn from the clean bilge tank by the feed pump. The bilge water then enters the OWS near the bottom of the solids sludge collecting chamber. Most of the free oil separates from the bilge water immediately due to the difference in specific gravity, and the reduced flow velocity inside the separator. The flow travels upward through the separating media matrix. This path increases contact with the separating media to improve coalescence of the free oil. The flow exits the top of the separating media matrix where the oil continues to flow upwards to the separator’s oil collecting chamber due to the difference in specific gravity. The bilge water less the majority of free oil is then drawn downward by the feed pump vacuum through the polishing pack. The polishing pack coalesces any residual free oil that may be left in the water until large enough to break loose, and rise to the oil collecting chamber. When sufficient oil has collected, the oil sensing probe (OSP) creates a signal to stop the feed pump, and open the clean water inlet valve. Pressurized clean water fresh water, at 37.8oC (100oF) maximum enters from the bottom of the OWS, and flows upward through the polishing pack displacing the accumulated oil in the oil collection chamber (top cover of the OWS) which is discharged through the oil discharge line. After the accumulated oil has been discharged, and the OSP is again immersed in water, the OWS returns to its normal operating mode. The partially cleaned bilge water less the majority of free oils, but with some emulsified oils, is drawn through the OWS by the feed pump. The feed pump then pressurizes the bilge water for processing through the process filter before supplying the process pump with a positive suction head. The process filter removes suspended solids, and oil droplets of approximately 5 microns + from the flow.

The Oily Water Separator (OWS) is a two stage bilge water separation system. The first stage generates a vacuum, differential specific gravity, and a two stage coalescer for the removal of the majority of free oil, and dirt separation. The second stage uses micron filtration for removal of trace solids, and small oil droplets followed by ultra-filtration to separate, and remove emulsified oils, along with the remaining minute solids, and entrained air from bilge water. The system is designed for continuous and/or intermittent operation. After the system has been started, it is capable of automatic operation.

e) Set the valves in accordance with the following table.
g) Check that power is available to the separator control panel, then turn the power switch to the ON position.
h) Turn the oily water separator switch to the AUTO position.
• The feed pump starts.
• The process pump starts.
i) In automatic mode, the OWS will discharge oil into the oily bilge tank No.2 when the level sensing probe detects an oil level and will monitor the oil content of the discharge water.
In MANUAL mode, the OWS operates independently of the oil level switches and therefore will NOT automatically stop. If operating in manual mode, the system should be kept under permanent supervision.
Processed bilge water with an oil content less than 15ppm will be discharged overboard.
Processed bilge water with an oil content greater than 15ppm will automatically be discharged to the oily bilge tank No.2 until the water is clean enough to discharge overboard.
Any oil collected at the top of the bilge separator will be discharged to waste oil tank No.2.
j) Record the operation in the Engine Room Log, and Oil Record Book.
Stopping the Oily Water Separator
a) Stop the separator by pressing the STOP pushbutton. This will start an automatic flush of the membranes before shutiing down th OWS
b) Turn the main ON/OFF switch to the OFF position.

6.3.3 HYDRAULIC VALVE REMOTE CONTROL SYSTEM
Hydraulic Valve Remote Operating System Hydraulic Power Pack
Introduction
The hydraulic valve remote control system enables fuel oil transfer, bilge, ballast, cooling sea water, and fire main valves to be operated from the CAMS screen displays in the ship’s control centre (SCC), and the engine control room.
When the hydraulic power unit is activated, hydraulic power is available to open and close all valves connected to the system. The hydraulic oil supply to the valves works on a constant pressure principle at 135 bar (1,958psi), while the pump(s) operate in a pressure range of 145 to 165 bar (2,103 to 2,393psi) via a start/stop control system. Each pump unit has the capacity to open or close three of the largest diameter valves simultaneously from fully open to closed or vice versa within one minute at an ambient temperature of 20°C (68°F)
Pressure switch settings are as follows:
• High oil pressure alarm 170 bar (2,466psi).
• Running/standby pump stop 165 bar (2,393psi). • Service pump start 145 bar (2,103psi).
• Standby pump start 140 bar (2,030psi).
• Low oil pressure alarm 130 bar (1,885psi).
Two accumulators are installed to store a reserve of hydraulic power in the event of failure of the pumps. They also damp out pressure fluctuations and reduce the frequency of pump starts. The accumulators have sufficient stored energy to operate three of the largest butterfly valves simultaneously from fully open to closed or vice versa.
Should there be a failure of the hydraulic power unit or loss of electrical power, the valves may be opened and closed using one emergency handpump in each machinery space, or one stationary hand pump in in ER2, ER1, AMR3, and AMR2.
The system has pressure and temperature compensating blocks, so that variations in pressure and temperature which are not produced by the controller are not allowed to activate the system. The CAMS display allows valves to be selected for opening and closing, and also indicates a valve’s current position.
The hydraulic power pack unit operates 98 system valves as follows: • Ballast system x 39.
• Bilge system x 43.
• FO transfer system x 8.
• Fire main system x 4.
• Cooling water system x 4.
There is a central hydraulic power pack located in ER1, at floor level starboard side outboard of No.1 MGE, which provides hydraulic power for operating the
Empire State Bridge Operating Manual
valves. The opening or closing of a valve is initiated by selecting the open or close option on the respective screen display. Most valves operated using this hydraulic system are the fully open or closed type, the exceptions being No.1 bilge/ballast pump discharge valve BA033, No.2 bilge/ballast pump discharge valve BS045, No.1 bilge/auxiliary seawater pump outlet valve CW517, and No.2 bilge/auxiliary seawater pump outlet valve CW617, which are of throttle type. These valves can be set between 0 and 100% open on the respective screen display.
Selecting ‘Open’ or ‘Close’ operates a solenoid valve, which directs oil from the power pack to the valve actuator and returns vent oil from the actuator in order to move the valve in the desired direction.
If there is a failure of the remote control system and the power pack is still in service, the valves may be opened and closed by manual operation of the individual solenoid valves. In an emergency, valves can be opened or closed by means of portable handpumps, five of which are provided. One pump is available in the following locations:
• MR2.
• ER2.
• ER1.
• AMR2.
• Bowthruster room.
The portable pumps attach to the emergency connections at the individual valves. Each valve has an extension pinion with a square end; a key may be attached to this pinion extension and the valve opened manually.
Four sationary handpumps for operating ships side overboard valves are at the following locations:
• ER2 for valve BS047.
• ER1 for valve BA038.
• AMR3 for valve BS021.
• AMR2 for valve BS011.
The power pack unit has 2 x 50 litre oil bladder type accumulators (the bladders are initially charged with nitrogen to 135 bar/ 1,958psi), and two electric motor-driven gear pumps which supply the system oil pressure. The oil accumulator has sufficient capacity to allow compensation for leakage from the system for about five minutes. In normal operation, one pump is selected as the duty pump, the pump operating between 145 and 165 bar (2,103 to 2,393psi). The second pump acts as a standby pump, which will cut-in automatically should the system pressure before the regulating pressure valve drop to 140 bar (2,030psi). This pump will automatically cut-out when the pressure reaches 165 bar (2,393psi).

A pump selection switch at the power pack control panel allows the pumps to be selected as duty (lead P1 - P2 etc) and standby (lag). The pump in service should be changed according to the Chief Engineer’s standing orders and company procedures in order to ensure that both power pack pumps have approximately equal running hours.
The hydraulic power pack control panel has a main switch for each pump and a control location switch LOCAL/REMOTE. Each pump has a START/ RUN illuminated pushbutton and a STOP pushbutton. The control panel also contains a MOTOR SPACE heater switch, and a heater status indicator light, a POWER ON indicator light, an ammeter and an hour meter. The power pack is normally operational in order that hydraulic power for actuating the valves is always available. The HPU alarm panel comprises the following alarm indicators:
• Low oil level.
• Low oil pressure.
• High oil pressure.
• High oil temperature.
• Filter clogged.
• No.1 motor overload.
• No.2 motor overload.
All system valves may be operated by the emergency handpumps, or by staionary handpumps*.

Operating the Hydraulic Valve Remote Operating System
a) Ensure that the oil system is fully charged, that there are no leaks evident and the oil level in the reservoir is at the normal working level. If necessary, top-up the reservoir using the correct grade of oil.
b) Check that the accumulator stop valves are in the open position, and that the drain valves are closed.
c) Turn the main switches for each motor starter to the ON position, the Power On indicator lamps for each pump should now be illuminated.
d) Turn the mode selection switch to the REMOTE position if control of the pumps is to be controlled from the CAMS screen display system.
System Checks
• Check the oil level in the power pack tank each week.
• Check for system leaks if the power pack tank level falls.
Change over the pumps as required, so that the running hours are approximately equal for each pump.

Operation of Pumps and Accumulators
Pump Unit
Each pump unit has sufficient capacity to close or open 3 sets of the largest valves simultaneously within sixty (60) seconds at normal ambient temperature.
Accumulators
The total capacity of the accumulators is sufficient to compensate for oil leakage through direction control valve during leakage compensating at normal ambient temperature; or to close or open 3 sets of the largest valves simultaneously.

a) b)
Open the solenoid valve box which feeds the valve to be operated.
Close the supply and return throttling/stop valves on the valve to be operated. Make a note of the amount of turns required to close the valves in order to return them to their correct positions when the valve is put back to normal operation. Making the isolation at this point for those tank valves which have the isolations on deck may be more expedient, as there may be problems due to the weathering effect on these deck isolating valves.
Failure to close the above valves could result in oil flowing into the reservoir and over-pressurising it, resulting in possible injury to the operator.
Note: The solenoid valves can be operated manually by operating the pushbuttons protruding through the solenoid coils.
WARNING
Wear protective clothing including visor or goggles when operating the portable hydraulic handpumps.

with bunkering must be raised. All shipboard personnel must be made aware that bunkering is to take place.
b) A bunker plan should be compiled and all personnel involved in bunkering should be fully conversant with the plan contents and have a copy of the plan readily available for reference. The Chief Engineer is responsible for bunker loading operations, assisted at all times by a sufficient number of officers and ratings to ensure that the operation is carried out safely.
c) It should be established if any local regulations will apply to the bunkering operation. Complete the pre-transfer checklist and port security checklists.
d) An effective deck watch is to be maintained at all times and should include adequate supervision of both the ship and terminal operations.
e) All personnel involved should be in hand-held UHF radio contact, the radios being tested prior to the bunkering operation. Both the ship and shore are to agree on predetermined emergency procedures.
f) Fire fighting and SOPEP equipment should be readied prior to the commencement of bunkering and be readily to hand. Portable pumps should be rigged by the deck scuppers.
g) All bunker hoses are to be in good condition, and means of support to be confirmed as adequate.
h) Scuppers and save-alls (including those around bunker tank vents) should be effectively plugged. Drip trays around the bunker manifold are to be clear of anything that may block their drainage.
i) Unused bunker manifolds are to be fully secured and blanked to prevent any inadvertent leakage.
j) The bunker tank vents are to be confirmed open prior to filling the respective tank.
k) Shore or barge tanks (whichever is applicable) should be checked for water content. The barge soundings are to be checked prior to the commencement of bunkering. The Chief Engineer should also calculate the estimated finishing ullages/ soundings prior to the starting of loading.
l) Loading should start at the agreed minimum loading rate. Only upon confirmation of no leakage and fuel going only into the nominated tanks, should the loading rate be increased.
IMO No: 9910313 Produced by: WMT Limited, UK
Empire State Engine Room Operating Manual
m) Where possible, new bunkers are to be segregated on board prior to use until results of the laboratory analysis have been received. The mixing of bunkers from separate deliveries is to be avoided, and wherever possible, bunkers are not to be used until a satisfactory oil analysis has been received.
n) No internal transferring of bunkers should take place during bunker loading operations unless permission has been obtained from the Chief Engineer.
o) Bunker tanks should not exceed the company stipulated maximum at any time. 90% (AUTHOR’S NOTE: Owner to confirm) full will give an adequate reserve space for fuel oil expansion owing to temperature. It should be confirmed as to the maximum filling quantity required by the owners and/or the charterers.
p) Any bunker barges attending the vessel are to be confirmed as having been safely moored alongside by the bridge before any part of the bunker loading operation begins.
q) Level alarms fitted to bunker tanks should be tested prior to any bunker loading operations and that tank gauging systems are operational.
r) A watch for signs of leakage should be kept at the manifold during loading.
s) The maximum pressure in the bunker line should be below 4.0 bar.
t) Representative samples are to be drawn using the continuous drip method for the duration of the loading operation, and they are to be immediately dispatched for laboratory analysis. In addition, duplicate oil samples are to be taken and retained on board for at least one year. All sampling must be witnessed by a representative of the supplier and be sealed in the presence of the supplier and the receiver. Ship’s copy of delivery notes are to be taken from the supplier and retained on board for a period of at least three years.
u) When the capacity of a tank being loaded approaches 80%, topping-off is to be carried out. The flow of oil to the tank in question should be reduced to half by diverting the flow of oil to another tank. In the case of the final tank, the loading rate should be reduced to the agreed minimum at least 20 minutes before the finishing ullage is reached. Endeavour to finish bunkers in the tank on the same side as the shore installation/ barge loading manifold. This will give visual, as well as verbal communication with the shore/barge operators.

Loading and Transfer of Marine Gas Oil Bunkers
No diving operations are to be undertaken whilst a bunker barge is alongside.
The ordering of any bunker fuel is to be in accordance with standard company operating procedures. In addition, it is important to note that no fuel loaded on board should have a sulfur content of more than the amount that is allowed by current regulations. This limitation also applies for the sulfur content of fuel to be burnt in port or in a sulfur restricted area.
Prior to bunkering, the Chief Engineer should confirm that the specification of the fuel oil being delivered is the same as that ordered, and that the quantity being supplied is also that which was requested. The fuel log must be completed to record the quantity of that ordered and the quality of that delivered. The purpose of this procedure is to ensure that bunkers of the correct specification and agreed quantity are received on board in a safe and efficient manner which minimises the risk of pollution.
a) Prior to bunkering, the operation must be discussed with the bridge team where any matters which are likely to interfere

Marine Gas Oil System
There are eight Marine Gas Oil (MGO) storage tanks, three MGO service tanks and three MGO settling tanks. The MGO is transferred from one tank to the other using the MGO transfer pumps.
The MGO storage tanks are filled from dedicated MGO bunkering lines located at the bunker manifolds on the port and starboard sides of the vessel at main deck level each side of the multi purpose space. The MGO transfer pumps are used to transfer oil from the storage tanks to the settling tanks at a rate of 30.0m3/h and a pressure of 3.0 bar. The pumps are started and stopped automatically.
The MGO service tanks, and the MGO storage tanks overflow to the 26.5m3 fuel overflow tank.
Marine Gas Oil Tanks (maximum filling capacity 98%)
The MGO storage, settling, service tanks are located as follows:
• Forward MGO storage tanks 1C, 2P, 2C, 2S between frames 159~182.
• Aft MGO storage tanks 3P, 3S, 4P, 4S between frames 13 ~ 48 aft.
• No.1 MGO settling and service tank (C) between frames 90~93. • No.2 MGO settling and service tank (P) between frames 48~51. • No.3 MGO settling and service tank (S) between frames 48~51.
The outlet valves from the MGO settling, and service tanks are remotely operated quick-closing valves with a collapsible bridge. They are pneumatically operated from the fire control station. After being tripped, the valve must be reset locally. Filling and transfer valves on the MGO storage tanks are operated from CAMS screen mimic
The MGO service and settling tanks are fitted with self-closing test cocks to test for the presence of, and to drain any water in these tanks. Tundishes under the self-closing test cocks drain any liquid to the sludge tank. All tanks are provided with level indication, plus remote level indication on CAMS.
Procedure to Load Marine Gas Oil Bunkers from Shore/Barge
The procedure below assumes that the MGO storage tanks are to be filled from the port bunker station manifold connection.
At the bunker loading connection to be used, remove the blank, and connect the bunker hose. Arrange a drip tray beneath the connection.
a) Ensure that the blanks on the other bunkering connections are secure and that the valves are closed. Ensure that the drain and sampling valves are closed.

6.4.2 TANK VENTS AND OVERFLOW SYSTEM Introduction
All tanks are vented to atmosphere; small tanks within the machinery spaces which contain small quantities of fluid, such as independent LO tanks, are vented within their respective compartments.
The air pipes from the WB tanks, void spaces, FW tanks, and MGO storage tank are fitted with a vent head of the automatic closed type (float disc type). Air vent heads for the MGO tanks are fitted with a stainless steel fire-proof screen, and those for FW tanks are fitted with an insect-proof stainless steel wire net. The height of the air pipes above the main deck are as follows.
• 760mm on the freeboard deck
• 450mm on the superstructure deck
Sounding pipes, where fitted for double bottom tanks are terminated in the respective engine rooms or machinery spaces, and those for FO tanks and LO tanks are fitted with a self-closing cap at upper end. Oil spill coamings having a capacity of minimum one (1) barrel are fitted under or around each vent pipe head of FO tanks, and LO tanks in compliance with the USCG requirements. A drain plug is fitted at the lowest point of the coaming. Equalizing holes are fitted at the uppermost part of the sounding pipe in tanks for to be sounded. A striking plate is fitted at bottom of each sounding pipe to protect the steel plate. As a remote level measuring system of the pressure sensing type is fitted to each FW tank no sounding pipe are fitted to these tanks.
The vent lines from the MGO service and settling tanks have no-return valves fitted that drain any liquid build up to the waste oil drain tanks. No.1 MGO service/settling tanks drain to waste oil tank No.1, and No.2 MGO service/ settling tanks drain to waste oil tank No.2 .
Sea chests have air venting throught holes on the shell plate instead of a venting pipe as far as practicable.
The FO overflow tank can be pumped out by No.1 MGO transfer pump. The contents of the MGO overflow tank can be pumped to No.1 MGO settling tank, or to the aft MGO storage tanks, or to the shore discharge connection at the bunker stations as required. The FO overflow tank has a high level alarm.
All clean and used LO tanks vent/overflow into a coaming around each tank. Each LO tank overflow line has a single vent which terminates in a gooseneck which then directs any overflow into a line which leads to the coaming around the tank.
The MGEs all have individual venting arrangements for their sump tanks. Each engine has two vent lines, each of those lines having two inlets. One vent is from the sump, the other is from the turbocharger. All vent lines are fitted with water traps, which overflow into nearby scuppers.
First Draft - May 2022 SSI / CUI:
Sludge tank No.1 vent is common with waste oil tank No.1 vent, and sludge tank No.2 vent is common with waste oil tank No.2 vent
The sludge oil mixing tank vents/overflows into a drain cowl then through normally closed valve OI353 toily bilge tank No.2. The drain cowl is vented on main deck level through a air vent goose neck pipe with a screen, and drain cowl. All bilge tanks vent to the main deck
The FW tanks, and the DW water tank vent through float disc type vents on the main deck, and the FW tanks are fitted with an insect-proof stainless steel wire net. BW and forward and aft heeling tanks vent to the maindeck
The sewage forward vacuum unit vents through a vent outlet on the foremast and aft vacuum units vent through vent outlets at the funnel. The sewage treatment units vent through a combined vent outlet at the funnel. The vent outlets are fitted with flame arresters.
The black sewage treatment system has its own venting arrangements. The vents from this system are led to the funnel where they are passed into the MGEs exhaust stream.
CAUTION
Grey water must not be discharged overboard except in waters where the discharge is permitted. The bridge must always be consulted before
any discharge of grey water.

6.4.3 LUBRICATING OIL FILLING AND TRANSFER SYSTEM Lubricating Oil Transfer Pumps
Both LO transfer pumps have a capacity of 11.7m3/h (413ft3/h) at 3.0 bar (43.5psi), and can take their suctions from any one of the following:
Empire State Engine Room Operating Manual
To Load Lubricating Oil Bunkers
At the LO bunker connection to be used, remove the blank, and connect the bunkering hose using a new joint. Arrange a drip tray beneath the connection. The area around the filling connection must be clean and the loading hose connected immediately to prevent the ingress of dirt. When this has been carried out, proceed as follows:
c) Ensure that the blanks on the other bunkering connection is secure, and that the manifold valve is closed.
d) Open the filling valve on the LO storage tank to be loaded (see tables below).
e) Remove the blank on the bunkering connection at the relevant bunker station. Check that the correct valves are open for the tank to be filled.
f) Establish effective communication between the bridge, engine control room, and the bunkering barge/shore station.
g) Signal to the shore installation/barge to commence pumping the confirmed LO grade at an agreed slow rate.
h) Check the ship-to-shore installation/barge connection and pipeline for leaks, and that LO is flowing into the correct storage tank and not to any other tank. Increase bunkering to the agreed maximum rate for the line.
i) As the level in the LO storage tank approaches 85%, signal to the barge/shore to reduce the flow rate until the tank has reached the required level, then signal to stop.
j) On completion of the bunkering operation, sound the tanks and agree the correct amount transferred to the vessel. Sign the LO receipt on confirmation of quantity received by supplier.
k) Leave the LO storage tank filling valve open for a time to drain the LO bunkering line back to the tank, then close the valve.
l) Close the bunker manifold valve, and disconnect the hose connection and replace the blank.
m) Ensure all the tank filling valves are closed.
n) Enter the details of the operation in the Oil Record Book.
Tank settings for loading LO are as in the table below, assuming that bunkering is from the starboard side manifold.

CAUTION
Extreme care must be taken when transferring LO to ensure that oils of different grades do not become mixed or contaminated. The setting of all of the valves must be checked and re-checked prior to starting operations to ensure oil will only be pumped or separated to and from the intended source/destinations. All transfers must then be recorded in
the Oil Record Book.
Loading Lubricating Oil from a Shore Station or Barge
Note: The preparation and operation procedures for loading should be followed as described in the Fuel Oil Bunkering and Transfer System section of this Manual. Precautions to be observed when loading LO are the same as for loading Marine Gas Oil. A bunker plan must be drawn up and adhered to with all loading/off loading operations recorded in the ship’s oil record book.
a) Prior to loading, check that there is sufficient capacity in the receiving tank to accommodate the LO ordered.
b) Agree with the supplier the amount of LO to be supplied. Ensure that the specification of the LO to be delivered conforms to the specification of the LO ordered.
IMO No: 9910313 Produced by: WMT Limited, UK
Each MGE sump holds 1.87 m3 of LO.
The MGE LO storage, and settling tanks are all fitted with quick-closing valves on their outlets that can be operated remotely from the fire control station in the event of an emergency. If tripped, the valves must be manually reset before the systems can be returned to operation. The tanks are also fitted with self-closing test cocks that are used to check for the presence of water and sludge. The drains from No.1 LO storage and No.1 settling tanks lead to the No.1 waste oil tank(S) of capacity 19.8m3. The drains from No.2 LO storage and No.2 settling tanks lead to the No.2 waste oil tank(P) of capacity 34.5m3. The LO settling tanks have a high level alarm that operates at 80% full.
The MGE LO settling tanks allow the contents of the MGE sumps to be removed for cleaning during periods of maintenance. The cleaning involves pumping the contents of a sump up to a settling tank, and allowing it to settle over a period of time so that any water and impurities can settle out.
The LO being pumped up to the settling tanks is normally batch processed before returning to the sump from where it came. When the renovated oil is being returned to its sump, it is run down under the action of gravity.
Both of the LO storage tanks are filled via dedicated lines from filling stations on the port and starboard side bunker stations on the main deck at the side of the multi purpose space.

All items of equipment and storage tanks in the engine room which contain LO or MGO are fitted with save-alls or similar devices for collecting any spilled oil, oil which leaks from glands or seals, or oil which is drained from tanks when sludging to remove water. This oil flows by means of gravity to No.1+2 waste oil tanks. Apart from non-return valves and inlet isolating valves, there are no valves in the waste oil collecting lines. Sludge/oil drain valves to the waste oil tanks must be maintained in the open position in order to ensure that the sludge/oil can flow to the tank at all times.
Each waste oil tank has a sludge pump by which the contents of the waste oil tank may be transferred to the sludge oil mixing tank, from where the sludge can be burnt in the incinerator. Alternatively, the waste oil tanks can be pumped ashore to a reception facility.
The sludge pumps must be started and stopped manually after the operator has opened the pump suction and discharge valves. The pumps are operated long enough to empty the associated waste oil tank, and it is then stopped; the pump must not be allowed to operate when it has lost suction. Waste oil tanks are fitted with high level alarms.

Introduction
Sludge and leak oil is collected from various locations around the machinery spaces iscollected into No.1 and No.2 waste oil tanks before treatment in the sludge mixing tank system. Each MGO separator has a sludge tank to which the separator discharges sludge. Each sludge tank drains to its respective waste oil tank by gravity. From the waste oil tanks, sludge may be pumped ashore using the associated sludge transfer pump.
Sludge from No.1 purifier sludge tank is drained to No.1 waste oil tank; sludge from No.2 purifier sludge tank is drained to No.2 waste oil tank. Sludge for treatment is taken from No.1 and No.2 waste oil tanks, and pumped to the sludge oil mixing tank where settlement takes place assisted by an electric heater in the tank. Some of the settled sludge is drained to oily bilge tank No.2. The remaining sludge is then burnt in the incinerator.
The No.1 and No.2 sludge pumps are used to pump sludge from the waste oil tanks to an approved reception facility ashore via discharges at the port and starboard bunker stations. They may also be used to pump sludge to the sludge mixing tank. After settlement the sludge can be burnt in the incinerator.
The sludge pumps are started and stopped by means of START and STOP pushbuttons, fitted locally. If sludge oil is being transferred ashore, the same precautions must be observed as when loading MGO bunkers; the SOPEP equipment must be complete, and available. Discharge of sludge oil ashore requires communication with the receiving station at all times. The ship and the receiving station must agree on the pumping rate, pumping start time, and the viscosity/temperature of the sludge oil being pumped. There are bilge/sludge oil shore discharge connections on the port and starboard sides of the ship at the bunker stations on the main deck.
Transferring Sludge
Transferring Sludge to the Sludge Oil Mixing Tank
This procedure is started manually, with the selected sludge transfer pump being started by the local pushbutton by the pump, and is stopped by the level switch in the sludge mixing tank.

Transferring Sludge Ashore
This procedure is completed manually, with the selected sludge transfer pump being started and stopped by the remote pushbuttons at the bunker station. The procedure described below assumes that No.2 sludge pump is being used to transfer sludge oil ashore via the discharge connection at the starboard bunker station. It is assumed that all tank suction valves have been checked as closed, except for those specifically mentioned:
a) Ensure that all bunkering precautions have been taken as described above.
b) Ensure the sludge pump suction filter is clean.
c) Ensure that the receiving station is aware of all conditions regarding the discharge operation, and the quantity, and quality of the sludge to be pumped.
e) Check communications between the ECR, the bunker station and the receiving station.
f) Remove the blank flange at the starboard bilge/sludge shore discharge connection, and attach the hose, ensuring that the joint is in good condition. Check that the blank flange at the

Operating the Quick-Closing Valve System
In normal operation, the supply line to the tank valves is vented to atmosphere, but when the cock is turned through 90o, compressed air is directed to the pistons which collapse the bridge of each valve, thus causing the valve to close.
The valves are reset by venting the air supply and operating the valve handwheel in a closed direction to reset the bridge mechanism, and then by opening the valve in the normal way. When the valve is fully open the locking arm can be reset by pushing the control lever on the end of the operation cylinder fully down.

Introduction
Poong Jin
350 liters at 8.0 bar 1
All the outlet valves from the fuel oil and lubricating oil tanks, from which oil could flow to feed a fire, are equipped with air operated quick-closing valves. They are supplied and controlled from the quick-closing valve air reservoir situated in emergency gear locker 2. The reservoir is supplied with air at a pressure of 8.0 bar from the control air system; the reservoir inlet valve from the compressed air system should be open at all times to ensure that the reservoir pressure is maintained.
The quick-closing valve air reservoir is fitted with a low pressure alarm transmitter and the pressure in the reservoir is displayed on the compressed air system CAMS mimic. The oil tank quick-closing valves’ actuator lines are grouped into three systems each with a three-way operating cock.
In normal operation, the supply line to the tank valves is vented to atmosphere. When the three-way operating cock is rotated, air is supplied to pistons which collapse the bridge of each of the valves, thus causing the valves to close.
The valves are reset by venting the air supply and operating the valve handwheel in a closed direction to reset the bridge mechanism and then opening the valve in the normal way.
The emergency generator fuel oil tank is fitted with a quick-closing valve OP301 which is operated by a directly connected wire from outside the compartment.

Ventilation systems in the engine room and accommodation spaces are provided with fan stops and fire dampers. Fans and ventilation systems may be stopped locally or remotely as required depending upon the nature of the outbreak.
Ventilation dampers are installed at various locations in order to shut off the flow of air which would feed a fire in a particular compartment. The dampers are to be closed in the event of a fire and ventilation fans shut off. In the event of a fire in a space where the Inergen fire suppression system is used, ventilation is automatically shut off when the system is initiated.
Air for operating these dampers is supplied by the control air system, the dampers are supplied from three master solenoid operated valve units located
Section 6.4 - Page 17 of 20
  CAUTION
 Some tanks such as small lubricating oil tanks do not have quick-closing apparatus fitted, as they are normally closed and only opened for short periods when required. It is important to ensure that these are always closed when not in use.

in the emergency gear locker No.2. Ventilation systems are grouped in order to allow any particular part of the ship to be isolated quickly. Each master valve supplies a number of individual fan dampers which are also fitted with solenoid control valves, this arrangement allows all of the dampers in the grouping to be closed at the same time, or allowing an individual fan damper to be closed when necessary.
Machinery Rooms Fire Dampers
Fire dampers operate to close the ventilation openings in the event of a fire in the engine room spaces. The dampers are kept open by air pressure supplied from the control air system. The dampers have a spring mounted in the cylinder assembly which will close the damper when the air pressure is vented. All dampers may be opened again by restoring the air flow to the damper unit.It is essential that the air supply valves are kept open in order to keep dampers in the open position for normal service. Remote operation of dampers from the emergency gear locker No.2 is arranged in three groups; these groups are indicated in the following tables. Each main group has a number of fan dampers associated within the group which can be closed independently when necessary.
Damper Operation
The damper is designed and constructed as a ‘fail close/fail open’ product (i.e. Fail close type damper is spring closes the damper blades upon loss of pneumatic or electrical supply. Fail open type damper is spring open the damper blades upon loss of pneumatic or electrical supply.)
a) The operation of the damper is controlled by a local electro- pneumatic control system. The damper controls enclosure contains the pneumatic actuator, plunger valve, solenoid valve and limit switches.
b) When the electrical supply to the solenoid valve is switched on, and the minimum air pressure is supplied to the actuator, the damper will open.
c) The damper will close, by way of actuator spring force, if there is loss of electrical power to the solenoid valve or loss of pneumatic supply. Pneumatic supply can be lost from the mains supply, or if the fusible bulb assembly is activated (i.e. bulb breaks).
d) When the fusible bulb operates, the plunger valve releases which in turn discharges air from the valve. This allows the spring return actuator to operate and close the damper.
e) The damper shall rotate anti-clockwise when opening and clockwise when closing. Direction of rotation is viewed on the drive end.
f) The limit switches shall be activated only within the last 5° of rotation of the blades when opening or closing. The blade position between fully open and fully closed can only be monitored at the enclosure, via the visual indicator.
Emergency Stops
In the event of a fire, it is essential any oil and air supply to the compartment be shut off and isolated. All machinery that could add to the fire must also be tripped and electrically isolated. The machinery involved comprises all FO pumps, hydraulic oil pumps, LO pumps and ventilation supply and exhaust fans. The various emergency stops are grouped together for ease of identification, being coded on the switchboards where the group starters are located. The coding is as follows:

6.6.1 ENGINE ROOM OVERHEAD CRANES Engine Room Cranes No.1+No.2
Overhead Cranes
The precautions that MUST BE taken when using the engine room overhead crane include, but will not be limited to the following:
General
• Overhead crane operation may only be carried out by competent personnel, trained to understand the hazards and risks involved with overhead crane activity.
• Personnel are, and will remain clear of the loads at all times.
• The load will not be suspended over, nor pass over personnel at any time.
• Under no circumstances may anyone ride the hook or load, injuries have occurred under these circumstances.
• Always operate the pushbuttons of the pendant with bare hands, operation wearing gloves introduces an increased risk of mis- operation.
• Never operate the crane from a remote location.
• The crane driver must always monitor the load, or the hook if the crane is being operated without a load.
• Never attempt to lift a load at an angle, center the overhead crane directly over the load before hoisting.
• Check that all lifting equipment to be used has a current test certificate, and check that the equipment is certified for the load to be lifted.
• A toolbox talk is required during which all of the team are involved.
• All personnel involved in the lifting activity are trained, competent and in possession of all required certification.
• NEVER stand or access below a suspended load.
Prior to Use
Prior to operation of the overhead crane, the person responsible for the
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
• Check that the hook rotates smoothly, the hook securing nut is normal and that the hook spring clip operates correctly.
• Check the weather conditions with the wheelhouse and request information regarding imminent maneuvers.
Prior to Lifting
Prior to attempting a commencement of a lift, the operation of the overhead crane under no-load condition MUST be checked:
• Check that the crane operates in the directions as indicated on the pendant pushbuttons.
• Hoist, Lower, Long Travel (forward/aft), Traverse (port/ starboard).
• Check that all hoist, lower, travel and traversing limit switches/ safety devices operate correctly.
• Check that the drum brake operates correctly.
• Whilst operating the crane under no-load conditions, check for unusual noise or vibration.
• Prior to commencing any overhead crane activity, sound the warning siren to warn personnel that the crane is about to move.
• Check that the lifting device (sling, shackle etc) is sitting in the saddle of the hook.
During Lifting
• Ensure that the hoist rope does not become wrapped around the load.
• Ensure that slings, load chains and other lifting devices are securely seated on the hook and without a twist that could cause the load to swing.
• Ensure that the hoist is located directly above the load to be lifted.
• Always lift vertically, as unnecessary force may be applied to the components of the crane when lifting at an angle.
• Check that the load is properly secured and balanced.
• This can be checked as the load is lifted slightly and the sling is repositioned as required.
• Do not lower a load to such an extent that the rope becomes slack, as it may leave the drum groove and become damaged during hoisting, a minimum of two full turns of the rope MUST always remain on the drum.
• When changing direction of long travel or traverse, stop the movement of the crane and activate the opposite movement to stop the load swinging.

Machinery handling equipment provides facilities for lifting, transport, and embarkation of machinery spares and stores. The lifting and transport requirements are satisfied by a number of different items of equipment including overhead cranes, chain hoists (blocks) with associated equipment, trolleys and pallet trucks.
Rails are fitted at locations throughout the machinery spaces in order to allow for the lifting and transport of machinery and other equipment. Hoists, chain blocks, eye bolts, wire strops, shackles etc, are colour-coded, indicating the maximum allowed loading. The Safe Working Load (SWL) must never be exceeded for any item of lifting equipment. It is the duty of the responsible person undertaking any operation requiring the use of lifting equipment to check that the equipment being used has a current certificate, that the equipment is in good condition and it is fit for purpose.

Each pair of MGEs. one pair in ER1, and one pair in ER2, has a 2.0 ton SWL capacity, electrically operated, travelling overhead gantry cranes. The hoist motor has two speeds, 3.0m/min on high speed, and 0.75m/min on low speed. The crane rails are fitted with toothed racks, and pinion drive arrangement. The gantry is fitted with a traversing toothed rack, and pinion drive arrangement which has the main hoist fitted to it.
The overhead cranes are fitted with the following safety devices:
• Hoist lowering limit.
• Hoist upper limit.
• Traversing limit (port and starboard) + clamp device.
• Travelling limit (forward and aft) + clamp device.
• Overload limit.
• The hoist is fitted with a mechanical overload on the hoisting wire which will stop any movement if the weight on the hoist exceeds 125% of the SWL.
The hoist is powered by a self-braking motor driving through a reduction gear unit. This drives a drum on which the hoisting rope is wound. The motor drive shaft is fitted with a fail-safe electromagnetic disc brake.
Procedure for Operating Engine Room Overhead Cranes
a) Ensure that all lifting equipment to be used has a current test certificate and check that the equipment is certified for the load to be lifted.
b) Visually check the lifting equipment for defects, and if there is any damage, replace the item with an undamaged component; the damaged item must be sent for repair or scrapped, whichever is appropriate.
c) Firmly attach the lifting equipment to the component to be lifted, and ensure that all parts are securely attached. All bolts, screws, etc, must be fully screwed down, and no part of the screw thread must be exposed.
d) At the control power isolator panel for the overhead crane to be used, turn the power supply circuit-breaker to the ON position.

Engine Room Lifting Arrangements
Machinery handling requirements include facilities for lifting, transport, and embarkation of machinery spares and stores. The lifting and transport requirements are satisfied by a number of different items of equipment, including overhead cranes and chain hoists with associated equipment, trolleys and a pallet truck.
Rails are fitted at locations throughout the machinery spaces in order to allow for the lifting, and transport of machinery and other equipment. Hoists, chain blocks, eye bolts, wire strops, etc, are color-coded, indicating the maximum allowed loading. The safe working load (SWL) must never be exceeded for any item of lifting equipment. It is the duty of the engineer responsible for any operation requiring the use of lifting equipment to check that the equipment being used has a current certificate, and that the equipment is in good condition.
General Engine Room Lifting Equipment
Throughout the engine room there are rail systems with trolleys and chain blocks. These items of equipment are manually operated, and care must be taken to ensure that the equipment is operated safely and that loads are within the lifting limits of the equipment. All trolleys and chains must be secured when not in use.
Chain Blocks
The use of chain blocks is straightforward and is not explained here.

6.6.3 ENGINE ROOM SERVICE/PROVISIONS CRANE Engine Room Service/Provisions Cranes
Crane Operation
Preparations Before Operation
The space heater for the electric motor should be switched on 10 hours before using the crane. After motor heating, warm up the hydraulic pump 30 minutes before using the crane by running the the electric motor.
1) Check the oil gauge of the hoisting and slewing reduction gears, and the hydraulic power unit LO tank.
• If the hook is at the top position it means that hoisting up limit valve is open. Therefore, keep the hoisting lever to in the ‘UP’ position for approximately3 minutes. Using the same method, ‘Lowering’ of the hook should be carried out.
• Luffing should be carried out from maximum radius to minimum radius approximately 5 times continuously. Slewing should be carried out to both ways approximately 2 turns.
2) Apply grease to grease points.
3) Switch ‘ON’ at the remote push button switch, and at the. ‘MCB’ starter.
4) Release the hook locking devices.
5) Raise jib without load.
6) Ensure that each limit valve operates properly without load.
7) Ensure that there are no defects with electric motor, brake, and cylinder.
Operating the Crane
The crane is operated by the main control valve, located on the operations platform. All crane operations have stepless speed control from 0-maximum. Two operations can be operated at the same time at maximum load, but at a reduced speed.
Hoisting Operation : Right Lever
• Hoisting : Move the control lever to ‘HOOK UP’ position.
• Lowering : Move the control lever to ‘HOOK DOWN’ position.
Luffing Operation : Middle Lever
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
Slewing Operation : Left Lever
• Slewing to right : Move the control lever to ‘CRANE RIGHT’ position.
• Slewing to left : Move the control lever to ‘CRANE LEFT’ position.
CAUTION
Operate the control levers smoothly, as jerking levers may cause the
swinging of the load especially when the load is suspended. Emergency Stop
Emergency stop is carried out manually by using one of the following methods:
1) Pressing the ‘STOP’ button on the starter panel.
2) Pressing the ‘STOP’ button on Remote START/STOP switch.
3) Turning ‘EMERGENCY STOP’ valve, fitted close to control platform.
Start after Emergency Stop, Due to System Failure
The following procedure is to be adhered to:
1) ‘Emergency operation instructions’.
2) Fault finding/trouble shooting to be initiated, possible findings are to be rectified prior to use of crane.
3) ‘Inspection Prior to Operation’ procedure to be carried out.
4) Start after emergency stops due to hazardous situations :
• Clear the area of unauthorized personnel.
• Carry out a normal start.
Jib Rest Valve
Jib rest valve is only used only for jib parking when the jib position is in the slewing sector area. The crane jib cannot operate luffing down to jib rest position (luffing angle 0°) in the slewing sector area. Luffing down operation in the slewing sector area will be done when the jib rest valve is closed.

Two engine room service/provisions handling cranes are fitted, one on the port side the other on the starboard side at the after most part of deck 05 level aft. Each crane consists of a base column, slewing ring, column and gear, jib and hoisting gear, with a control platform on the side of the crane platform. All electrical, hydraulic and mechanical units required for the operation of the cranes are housed inside the crane pedestal.
The cranes are of electro-hydraulic operation with the hoisting, slewing, and jib movement being powered by the self-contained hydraulics. A single hydraulic pump supplies the hydraulic motors for these operations; with the hoisting winch gear mounted on the jib, luffing of the jib is performed by a hydraulic cylinder and slewing gear mounted on the base plate of the slewing post.
The hoisting machinery consists of a winch drum that is driven through reducing gear. The winch gear is built on a frame with hydraulic brake, motor, and flange-mounted load holding valve. There is a flange-mounted hydraulic hook stop in the top and bottom positions. All the wire sheaves are provided with double roller bearings or oil-less bearing on steel axles, fitted with grease nipples.
The hoisting, luffing, and slewing movements of the crane are steplessly controlled by three hydraulic control levers, and carried out from the control stand position. The control levers are ‘spring-centred’, and designed to return to the neutral position when released. For each operation of hoisting, slewing, and luffing, one operation at full speed and two operations at reduced speed.

After Crane Operation
After operation, park the jib on the jib rest.
1) Turn the jib to the position above of the jib rest.
2) Move control lever to the position of ‘JIB DOWN’ and lowering to the parked on the jib rest. This work should be carried out with no load.
3) Park the hook.
4) Lock the hook with hook lashing rope then hoist the hook slightly to protect it from moving due to pitch and roll of the ship.
5) Switch ‘OFF’ on the control box and the starter main circuit
breaker.
Safety Features
Each of the cranes has the following safety features:
• Load Limiting System
The main hydraulic circuit is protected from over-pressure by a relief valve. In addition, the hydraulic circuit is equipped with a relief valve set to activate corresponding to the crane capacity.
• Hoisting Limit
The hook movement will be automatically stopped in both the upper and lower positions by limit switches on the hoisting winch.
• Luffing Stop
The maximum and minimum working radii are limited by the stroke end of the luffing cylinder.
• Load-Holding Valves
The winch motor, hydraulic cylinder and slewing motor are all provided with load-holding valves which will freeze the movement in case of hose rupture or other failure causing pressure drop.
• Slewing
Reduced out-reach through a certain slewing sector.
• Fail-Safe Brakes
Both winch motor and slewing motors are provided with fail-safe brakes, the brakes are spring operated and pressure released. The brakes will engage automatically if the control
First Draft - May 2022 SSI / CUI:
lever is in the neutral position. As the brakes are spring activated they close automatically upon failure of the hydraulic system.
• Emergency Lowering
In the event of a loss of power, the winch and jib may be lowered for each crane, and slewed by means of an emergency handpump which will open the winch brake.
• Emergency Stop
There is emergency stop pushbutton on the remote start/stop panel on the crane slewing pedestal and an emergency stop cock below the control levers.
Safety devices should not be released, as there is the risk that this will cause accidents and damage to property. The crane is set up with each safety device already adjusted at its proper position, never remove it or never change the adjusting position.

6.7 DRY DOCK SERVICES Introduction
When the ship is in dry dock, many normal ship’s systems will be inoperative and these services must be provided by alternative means. Dry dock operations will differ depending upon the facilities available at the dry dock, and the extent of work to be carried out. Prior to any dry docking, it is important to ensure which facilities will be available at the dry dock, and which systems the ship will be able to provide itself.
Under no circumstances should the ship provide services which might cause damage to shipboard equipment because support facilities such as cooling water, are unavailable. The shipboard equipment operated will depend upon the availability of support services and the nature of work to be undertaken in the dry dock. In certain cases it may be more convenient to have a service provided by shore facilities rather than use shipboard systems. The usual method of supplying power is by operating one of the MGEs utilising shore-side sea water cooling. However, operation of an MGE would preclude maintenance work being undertaken on that engine, and would require the fuel system, cooling system, etc, to be operated. Low load operations of the MGEs must also be avoided at the manufacturer’s recommendation.
Prior to the dry docking, a work plan must be drawn up and the services to be provided by the ship must be determined. All personnel involved in the dry docking must understand which services are to be provided by the ship and which are to be provided by shore systems. Equipment for connection of services to shore facilities must be checked and positioned at the correct location before the ship enters dry dock. Personnel involved in the changeover procedure to shore services must thoroughly understand the procedures involved and the safety implications of the change, if any. Listed below are services which may be provided from ashore during dry docking, however, all services may not be used. Agreement must be reached with the shore authorities regarding supplies to the ship or quantities pumped ashore; details of quantities received and pumped must be recorded.
Fire Main
The fire main must be pressurised at all times in order to ensure that water under pressure is available in the event of a fire. Connections are available on the main deck, at the international shore connections located at the port and starboard sides aft of the multi-purpose spaces A+B.
Shore Communications
It is essential that full shore communications are available at all times during dry docking. Although VHF radio and mobile communications will be maintained, it is essential that land line telephone communications are also available. The shore telephone connection must be established as soon as the ship is in dry dock.
Electrical Power
Electrical power can be provided by operation of the ship’s own MGEs. Cooling will be supplied from the shore via sea water connections in the bunker stations. The vessel can also be supplied with 6,600V power from ashore. Shore connections are provided through in the HV shore power room to No.1 and No.4 busties. The connections between the ship and the shore are via five plug/socket arrangements. The shore power system and procedures are described in the relevant section in this manual.
Compressed Air
Instrument and working air can be supplied by the working/control air compressors in association with air dryers. If necessary, the starting air compressors can supply air via the cross-connections, refer to the relevant section in this manual for details of the cross-connection procedure. These compressors, and dryers may be operated in dry dock if the LT cooling fresh water system is operational. Alternatively, a shore connection is provided, allowing these units to be shut down if required.
Steam
Steam may be required for heating purposes on board the ship. For port use there is one HVAC shore steam heater sized at 0.3 MW in MR1. For arrangements for this heater see the relevant section in this manual. Steam and condensate connections are located at the bunker stations port and starboard on the main deck.
Cooling Sea Water
(Authors Note: This section to be confirmed by Owners.)
Cooling sea water connections are available at the port and starboard bunker stations on deck, which allow sea water to be supplied to the auxiliary consumers and MGE cooling systems. The cooling sea water pumps of both systems are not operated as sea water flows through the system coolers under pressure from ashore. Sea water is discharged when the associated ship overboard discharge valve is opened, see the relevant section in this manual. The supply of sea water from ashore is lower than that provided by the ship’s pumps and so the cooling load must be lower. As the ship is in dry dock, fewer items of plant will be operating and so there is unlikely to be any problem, but the outlet sea water temperature must be monitored so that it remains within acceptable limits. Cooling sea water can also be supplied to the air conditioning chillers.
Facilities must be available at the dry dock for removal of used cooling sea water. This can be discharged into the dry dock via the overboard discharges with the approval of the dry dock authorities although some form of collection arrangement will need to be provided to ensure that the water does not spread over the dry dock area. Agreement on such services must be reached with the dry dock authorities and this means that a decision must be made as to what machinery is to operate whilst the vessel is in dry dock.
Potable Water

Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
Potable water is normally produced on board, and the fresh water tanks may contain sufficient potable water for a limited stay in dry dock. However, for a prolonged stay or if work is to be undertaken on the fresh water tanks it may be necessary to take fresh water from ashore. Shore connections are close to each potable water tank air vent. A check should be carried out on shore supplied water to ensure that it is fit for human consumption.
Effluent/Grey Water
The ship has a large effluent/GW storage capacity which will normally be emptied before the vessel enters dry dock. Provided that their use does not disturb the loading on the dry dock blocks and the ship’s structure, the tanks may be used when in dry dock. The loading on the GW system will be lower when the ship is in dry dock compared with normal service, but the tanks may be filled during a prolonged stay. Connections are available at the port and starboard bunker stations for the shore discharge of effluent or GW. The GW discharge pumps are used, and the shore discharge pipe is connected to the ship’s system by means of an international connection. Any pumping ashore of effluent/GW water must be with the agreement of the shore authority. Any storage in GW tanks must be clearly marked, to ensure correct later disposal. See the relevant section in this manual.
Black Water
Raw BW may be pumped ashore using the BW discharge pumps, and the BW system shore connections. There are discharge connections at the port and starboard bunker stations. Normally, such a discharge is not necessary, and if required, would be undertaken prior to entering dry dock. See the relevant section in this manual.
Oily Bilge System
The oily bilge system may be pumped ashore via connections at the port and starboard bunker stations. If required, this procedure is normally undertaken before the vessel enters dry dock, but in an emergency, the option is available to pump the oily bilges ashore using the bilge housekeeping pumps. See the relevant section in this manual.

Introduction
The Air Conditioning (AC) installation is based upon air handling units (AHUs) which are circulated with chilled water and hot water to provide cooling and heating as required. The AHU fan blows air over the cooling/heating coils, and this chilled/warm air is distributed to the accommodation and other spaces associated with that AHU. The air circulation system incorporates fan coils in the public rooms and cabins, and so the system is one of AHUs and FCUs.
The chilled and hot water circulation systems are separate, the chilled and hot water ranges being designed to satisfy Safe Return to Port (SRtP) regulations. This means that there are effectively two separate chilled water systems and two separate hot water systems, but in each case, the separate systems are normally operated as a single combined system. Should a SRtP situation arise, the systems may be isolated on the water delivery and suction sides by means of isolating valves. AMR1 and AMR4 systems have chiller units, chilled water circulation pumps, hot water heaters, and hot water circulation pumps. Each hot and cold water circulation system has a compressed air pressurised expansion vessel.
A shore steam HVAC heater is fitted in MR1 for use when alongside a berth.
Chilled Water System
The chillers for each system cool the chilled water, the chillers being refrigeration units operating on R134a refrigerant gas. The compressed gas is cooled in the associated condenser unit which is circulated with sea water.
Chilled water is supplied to the AHUs and FCUs at a temperature of 6°C (43°F) with a designed return water temperature of 14°C (57°F). The chilled water installation is a closed system, composed a primary loop (constant flow) and a secondary loop (variable flow).
The chilled water system comprises of two subsystems; one aft in AMR1, one forward in AMR4. AMR4 subsystem serves FZ1and FZ2; and AMR1 subsystem serves FZ3, FZ4 and FZ5. Each subsystem consists of two chillers with a control panel, two chilled water pumps, piping, for their consumers including AHU, FCU, and cooling coils, and control panels. Each chiller is sized to handle 50% of the total subsystem load requirement. Each pump is sized to handle 100% of the subsystem total chilled water flow capacity. Each chiller regulates the condenser seawater valve to maintain constant chilled water supply temperature of 6°C (43°F).
Each chilled water subsystem, and pump control panel alternates each pump running/operating hours to automatically change over every 200 hours to equalise the running time of each item of equipment. The chillers have self- regulating controls.
When the chilled water subsystem starts to meet cooling demand, the lead chiller motorized isolation valve opens. When the lead isolation valve is confirmed open, the lead pump starts, as required. When the lead pump running
is confirmed, the chilled water subsystem control panel delivers run permission to the lead chiller (with the fully open lead isolation valve) which will start and operate to maintain 6°C (43°F) supply water temperature. If the supply water temperature remains above 6°C (43°F) for 10 minutes, the 2nd chiller shall start for additional cooling to achieve and maintain combined subsystem supply water temperature of 6°C (43°F).
All chilled water consumer control valves are 3-way valves. All consumer control valves are of the modulating type for added system control. Each chilled water subsystem control panel has an ethernet connection to the network for communication with the touchscreen control panels, and the other HVAC local control panels.
Hot Water System
The two hot water subsystems are associated with the two chiller subsystems AMR1 and AMR4. Each subsystem consists of two hot water pumps, piping, and their consumers including AHU heating coils, and control panels. There are two heat exchangers which make use of waste heat from the MGEs jacket water, each sized for 100% of the total HVAC heating load, and one shore steam heater sized at 0.3 MW. The two hot water subsystems are each connected to both heat exchangers, and the shore steam heater. Each hot water pump is sized to handle 100% of the subsystem’s total hot water flow capacity. In case of the central heating system failure, each AHU is provided with 100% electric heat as backup.
The hot water subsystem control panel alternates each pump running/operating hours to automatically change over every 200 hours to equalise the running time of each item of equipment.
When the hot water subsystem starts to meet heating demand, the consumer control valves begin to open due to space temperatures falling below specified setpoints, and the lead pump starts, as required.
All hot water user control valves are 3-way valves. All consumer control valves are of the modulating type for added system control. Each hot water system (pump) control panel has an ethernet connection to the network for communication with the touchscreen control panels, and the other HVAC local control panels.
Control and Monitoring
The systems can be selected to operate in either remote mode (touchscreen operation) or local mode (panel operation) via a toggle switch fitted on each of the AHU and FCU local control panels. Switching function between local and remote mode is not possible from CAMS. Operational modes (OFF/ON) can be selected locally at the HVAC local control touchscreen panel in Local mode, or remotely from the HVAC system touchscreen, in Remote mode.
Local Mode
The operator can start and stop the system locally at the control panel. Remote commands are overriden.
Remote Mode
Central touchscreen panels are installed on the bridge, and on the bridge braining area for remote control of all local control panels. Local commands will be overrriden. The system can only be started/stopped via remote signals from CAMS.
Control Panel Interlocks
The panels have direct interlocks between each of the pumps, and each of the chiller built-in control panels to ensure chiller only operates when a pump is running. AMR4 chilled water system chillers are interlocked with AMR4 chilled water pumps, and AMR1 chilled water chillers are interlocked with AMR1 chilled water pumps. There are no interlocks between AMR4 and AMR4 chilled water systems as they operate independently from one another.
System ‘Running/On’ Automatic Mode
AHU Systems
In this condition, the AHU is cooling, or heating depending on the return air temperature, and this will indicate on the local touchscreen panel which mode it is in. The AHU supply fan speed is constant. Humidification is only possible in heating mode, and is off during cooling mode.
During intermediate seasons, the AHU fans will continue operating at constant speed, and the chilled water or hot water 3-way control valves will open or close according to demand. AHU-16 may reduce airflow to and from the Multi- purpose space rooms when not occupied.
Switchover from heating to cooling will occur if:
• The return air temperature transmitter is 1°C (34°F) above the setpoint for 15 minutes. This is adjustable on the touchscreen having a range of 0 to 30 minutes.
• The heating output of PI has been 0% continuously throughout the above time.
Switchover from heating to cooling will occur if:
• The return air temperature transmitter is 1°C (34°F) below the setpoint for 15 minutes. This is adjustable on the touchscreen having a range of 0 to 30 minutes.
• The cooling output of PI has been 0% continuously throughout the above time.

The default heating mode is hot water. If the AHU is in heating mode and the temperature setpoint is not achieved after 10-15 minutes (programmable by user) then a warning is displayed at the touchscreen panel. Checking the operation of the hot water 3-way control valve, and/or the hot water circulation pump operation, and electric heating should automatically be engaged to provide heat and achieve the system setpoint. This default setting ensures that the AHU heating function is maintained if the MGE is not running such as when the ship is alongside a berth, or if there is a problem with the hot water system that requires investigation and correction. There is a button which allows manual selection of ‘Electric Heating’ mode if hot water will not be available.
System ‘Running/On’ Automatic ‘Electric Heat’ Mode
AHU Systems
This condition occurs if the hot water heat exchanger system has failed or has been shut down. ‘Electric Heating’ mode should be manually selected. The AHU supply fan speed remains constant. Humidification is only enabled in electric heating mode and is disabled during cooling mode.
Switchover from electric heating to cooling will occur if:
• The return air temperature transmitter is 1°C (34°F) above the setpoint for 15 minutes. This is adjustable on the touchscreen having a range of 0 to 30 minutes.
• The heating output of PI has been 0% continuously throughout the above time.
Chilled Water Systems
In this condition, the duty or standby pump is operating at constant speed, and one or both chillers are operating, dependent on supply water temperature.

Procedure for Operating the Chilled Water System
It is assumed that the forward and aft systems (chilled water loops AMR4 and AMR1) are operating independently. It is assumed that the chiller sea water systems are fully operational as described above in this manual. The chilled water pumps are associated with specific chiller units, and they will operate when these chiller units are set to operate.
The description assumes that the chilled water systems are set for cooling and each is already fully charged with water. The chilled water pressure vessel/ expansion tanks must be maintained at about 3⁄4 full; it is assumed that the make-up water supply line valves to the pressure vessels are open.
a) Ensure that the chilled water piping system and pumps are filled and that the expansion tank is at the correct level. Check that the expansion tank outlet valve is open.
b) Check that all instrumentation valves are open and that the instruments are reading correctly.
c) Set the valves as in the following tables. The valve settings assume that all chiller units in each loop are connected to the chilled water distribution system, and available for operation.
In the tables below, the systems are set for normal summer operation with chilled water circulation.

e) Set the chilled water system valves for the AHUs and FCUs as required (normally open). The control system for the AHUs and FCUs will adjust the flow of hot and chilled water to maintain the required temperature and humidity of the air leaving the AHU/FCU.
Note: A number of final users are supplied from each branch system. At each final user location, there are supply and return valves to the local AHU/FCU and both must be opened in order to ensure a supply of chilled water.
f) Ensure that the sea water cooling system for the chiller units is operational.
g) Select the chilled water pumps for Remote operation, and at the CAMS mimic, select the required operating sequence.
h) Set the chiller units to Automatic operation, and select the sequence at the CAMS mimic. Check the operation of the chiller(s) and their associated sea water system(s).
The chilled water circulation system will start automatically and maintain the temperature of the water circulated through the heat exchangers of the AHUs in the ship. The number of pumps operating depends upon conditions. The number of chiller units operating will depend upon the cooling load and the control system will operate units as required.

The chillers may be shut down when not required and the valves will normally be left open. However, for prolonged shutdowns, the system must be isolated and the gas pumped to the condenser. Prolonged shutdowns may be required if the vessel is operating for long periods in cold conditions or if a chiller is being repaired.
When preparing for a prolonged shutdown, the refrigerant gas is pumped to the condenser or transferred to the storage facility as applicable. Compressor gas valves are closed securely. When the compressor is shut down, its electrical system must be isolated.
Procedure for Operating the Hot Water System
The HVAC water heaters recover heat from the MGE HT cooling water systems, and uses it to provide heating for the HVAC hot water circulation system. The heat from the MGE HT cooling water heats up the glycol/water circulating through the HVAC water heater, and circulates through the AHUs, and various FCUs. Circulation of the glycol/water is carried out by hot water circulating pumps.
There are two hot water subsystems associated with the two chiller subsystems AMR1 and AMR4. Each subsystem consists of two hot water pumps, piping, and their consumers including AHU and FCU heating coils, and control panels. The two heat exchangers make use of waste heat from the MGEs jacket water, each sized for 100% of the total HVAC heating load. For port use there is one shore steam heater sized at 0.3 MW. The two hot water subsystems are each connected to both heat exchangers, and the shore steam heater. Each hot water pump is sized to handle 100% of the subsystem’s total hot water flow capacity. In case of hot water heating system failure, selected AHUs are fitted with 100% electric heaters as backup.
This description assumes that the hot water systems are set for heating and each is already fully charged with glycol/water. The hot water pressure vessel/ expansion tanks must be maintained at about 3⁄4 full.
a) Ensure that the hot water piping system and pumps are filled and that the expansion tank is at the correct level. Check that the expansion tank outlet valve is open.
b) Check that all instrumentation valves are open and that the instruments are reading correctly.
c) Set the valves as in the following tables. The valve settings assume that all hot water systems in each loop are connected to the hot water distribution system, and available for operation.

6.5.2 ACCOMMODATION AIR CONDITIONING SERVICES
Introduction
Air Handling Unit System Operation
Air conditioning throughout the ship is divided into zones which correspond to the fire zones of the vessel; no air flow takes place between fire zones, as ducts do not cross zones. Within each zone there are a number of separate air conditioning stations, each with its own air handling unit (AHU) which circulate conditioned air to selected spaces. In addition, public rooms, and cabins are fitted with Fan Coil Units (FCUs) which provide extra cooling/ heating as and when required at specific locations.
Each AHU is fitted with a fan which circulates air to its designated spaces. The number of air distribution lines from the fan depends upon the size of the AHU, and the spaces it serves. Extractor (return) fans discharge air from the accommodation spaces to the atmosphere, and the AHU fan draws fresh air in from outside. The air flow requirement is designed around minimum air changes per person or minimum air change required for a particular space, whichever is the greater. There are no air flows between zones as the ducts never cross over zones.
Heat Recovery Systems
The heat recovery AHUs supply a mixture of return air, drawn from the system compartments and corridors, and minimum fresh air for personnel, drawn from outside. Toilets have conditioned air transferred from other accommodation spaces such as cabins and corridors, via door grilles or undercut doors, and all air from these spaces are mechanically exhausted via the local sanitary exhaust ventilation system. Air from adjacent compartments is supplied with free- cooling ventilation and/or spot air conditioning. This air is mechanically exhausted via the local exhaust ventilation system.
Non-return dampers are installed where necessary to prevent any backflow from toilet spaces to other spaces connected to the sanitary exhaust system. The return air to fresh air ratio is maintained by balancing dampers which have been set during commissioning.
100% Fresh Air Systems
The 100% fresh air AHUs only supply fresh air, drawn from outside. Toilets shall have conditioned air transferred from other accommodation spaces such as cabins and corridors, via door grilles or undercut doors, and all air from these spaces is mechanically exhausted via the local sanitary exhaust ventilation system. All air supplied to the system compartments is naturally and/or mechanically exhausted to balance the 100% fresh air requirement. Ventilated stairwells are fitted with a fresh air supply fan, and electric duct heater for pre-heat of the fresh air during winter. Air is supplied to the lowest level of each stairwell, and all air is naturally exhausted from the top level. The
electric duct heater is controlled by a wall mounted temperature transmitter located within the stairwell.
Fan Coil Unit System Operation
Fan coil units (FCU) contain a fan which draws air in from a space into the unit, then blows it over a cooling or heating coil. A chilled water coil is for cooling, and an electric heater is for heating. An FCU works by transferring heat from the air passing over the internal heat exchanger to the chilled water passing within. Cold water is supplied by a chiller unit.
Fire dampers are fitted to the ducts of this system, and are powered and controlled via the FCU control panels. There is one local fire damper control switch (push button) installed inside each room protected by fire dampers to allow manual closure of these dampers. In some cases, there may also be one local fire damper control switch installed outside a room protected by fire dampers to allow manual closure of these dampers. Generally, manual closure of the dampers from outside the room is from the FCU control panels. Each fire damper control switch is connected directly to the FCU control panel that powers its associated fire dampers.
A return air temperature transmitter mounted in the main return duct, or within the space being served sends a signal to the FCU control panel. The control panel then uses the return air/room temperature input to control the electric heating stage to provide heating to all spaces during heating mode. Alternatively, during cooling mode, the control panel uses the same return air/ room temperature input to control the chilled water cooling coil valve position for each FCU to provide cooling to all spaces as required.
Heat Recovery Systems
All FCUs are heat recovery FCUs which supply a mixture of return air, drawn from the system compartments, and minimum fresh air, drawn from outside. Dependent upon available external static pressure with the FCU fan motor, minimum fresh air (unconditioned) is supplied directly to each FCU using a separate fan. The return air to fresh air ratio is maintained by the balancing dampers which have their opening positions set during commissioning.
System Descriptions
AHUs
Each AHU has its own control panel. Each control panel has an ethernet connection to the network for communication with the touchscreen panels, and other HVAC local control panels. Laundry heaters operate as required to ensure the minimum temperature of the fresh air supplied to the room is 4.3oC (39.7oF). The temperature setpoint is adjustable at the AHU control panel.

The ship’s machinery spaces are force ventilated by means of a number of electrically-driven fans. The fans force air into the machinery spaces. All machinery spaces are fitted with ventilation fans, and the fans for each compartment are controlled separately. Fire dampers and shut-off dampers are fitted so that air flow due to natural draught may be controlled. Fire dampers and shut-off dampers are fitted in the machinery spaces.
When a start order for a fan is issued by the controller, the damper opens and that authorises the starting of the fan. If the fan does not start before expiry of the set time delay interval (typically 3 minutes), an alarm is raised. For a stop order, the fan stops, and the damper closes after a time delay. If the damper is closed whilst the fan is running, the fan will be stopped. All machinery space fans may be controlled locally or remotely from the fan control touchscreen, and each fan drives its own associated damper(s) via the fan starter. The screen mimic indicates the fan and damper status.
First Draft - May 2022 SSI / CUI:
Most fans may be operated in Local or Remote mode; they may also be selected to operate in Automatic mode or Manual mode. In Manual mode, the air flow is set manually at the fan control panel touchscreen panel in terms of a percentage of the maximum designed air flow. When fans are operated in Automatic mode, the control system determines the air flow requirement of the space served, and adjusts the speed of the fans to obtain the correct flow. The air flow requirement is based upon pressure differential between the compartment served, and an external reference temperature; in addition, account is taken of the cooling requirement, and the number of changes of air needed. Pressure in the machinery spaces varies with the number of MGEs running, and although ER1 and ER2 are provided with combustion air fans, there will be a variation because of air flows between compartments when watertight doors are open.
Fan Starting and Stopping
Fans can be Started/Stopped and selected to Auto/Manual at the following locations:
• Fan control panels touch screens. • Wheelhouse CAMS.
• Training bridge CAMS.
• Local starting in fan rooms.
Variable Speed Fans
The fan speed set point is defined by the PID controller which maintains the pressure in the compartment or room at the pressure selected by the operator.
Air flow requirement for comfort air depends upon the need for air change and also for cooling. Flow requirement calculations take into account the external air temperature, and so the speed of the fan may be reduced, and less energy consumed, if the external temperature allows for that. The value of the upper temperature limit may be set at the touchscreens. The minimum air flow from a fan is dictated by two factors, these being the allowed minimum speed of the fan, controlled by its inverter, and the minimum number of air changes per hour required in the compartment served.

6.5.4 PROVISIONS REFRIGERATION SYSTEM
Introduction
Provision Refrigeration System
The provision refrigeration system consists of one refrigeration plant having two condensing units (CDUs). The refrigeration plant has one plant control/ starter panel for both CDUs, one system control panel for the freezing room, chilled room, lobby for freezing room, and lobby for the chilled room. The daily room refrigeration system has a separate control panel. One ozone generator is fitted in the chilled room. A toggle switch located on the unit is used to turn it On/Off. Once On, the unit operates continuously, independent of the rest of the system.
The chilled room is fitted with an ozone generator, which has a sterilising effect on the atmosphere of the chamber, helping to maintain the freshness of the produce stored in the chamber.
Refrigeration Plant
The refrigeration plant consists of two sea water-cooled refrigeration CDUs, one for duty, and one on standby. A plant control/starter panel is fitted on the skid to control both CDUs. Each refrigeration CDU comprises of a semi hermetic reciprocating compressor, a 2-way sea water regulating valve for head pressure control, a sea water cooled shell shell/tube condenser, an oil separator, a refrigerant receiver, suction accumulator, and safety devices.
Unit Coolers (UCs)
The provision refrigeration plant serves five refrigerated spaces, these being:
• Freezing room.
• Chilled room.
• Lobby for freezing room.
• Lobby for chilled room.
• Daily room.
The refrigeration CDUs serves a set of ceiling suspended Unit Coolers (UC). The freezing room unit coolers have electric defrost heaters, insulated and heated drain pans and heated drain lines. The remaining rooms have mechanical evaporator pressure regulating valves on the suction return line. Each UC is fitted with a thermostatic expansion valve, liquid line solenoid valve, and service isolation valves.
Refrigeration System Control Panels
There are two refrigeration system control panels in the refrigeration provision plant. One panel serves the freezing room, chilled room, lobby for freezing room, and lobby for chilled room. A separate refrigeration system control panel serves the daily room.
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
The touchscreen of each system control panel allows for remote start/stop of UCs. Pressing the button on the touchscreen will stop the respective room fan, and liquid line solenoid valve. Each control panel provides power to the components below. The control panel receives temperature from the refrigerated spaces, and status inputs from the CDU’s.
The control panel provides outputs to the following:
• Liquid line solenoid valves in each room.
• Fans in unit coolers in each room.
• Electric defrost heaters in freezing room unit coolers.
• Drain line heater in the freezing room.
• Cooling demand signal to the duty condensing unit.
• Room temperatures to CAMS.
The control panel receives the following inputs:
• Individual alarm signals from the duty CDU.
• Alarms from the duty CDU.
• Compressor run status from the CDUs.
• Temperature transmitter readings from each room.
• Defrost ‘Off’ signal from each of the freezing room unit cooler.
• Heater high limit switch signal from each of the freezer room UCs.
Control Operation
Modes of Operation:
In ‘Normal’ mode, one CDU is in operation (duty unit), and the second unit is on standby. The system can be run in ‘Pulldown’ mode on either of the two system control panels if the freezing room or chilled room is at a temperature of 4°C(39°F) (adjustable on the touchscreen, default: 4°C (39°F), range: 1°C (34°F) to 10°C(50°F)) above set point for more than 30 minutes (adjustable on touchscreen, default: 30 minutes, range: 15 to 180 minutes).
In ‘Pulldown’ mode, the control panel allows simultaneous running of two CDUs. Before selecting the system to ‘Pulldown’ mode, the touchscreen on the system control panel will ask the operator to ensure that both sets of crossover liquid, and suction isolation valves on each of the CDUs are in the open position. During ‘Pulldown mode’, both CDUs run simultaneously to lower the room temperatures from the initial high temperature to the setpoint entered manually.
Pulldown is completed when the freezing room and chilled room is at set point +0/-1°C (+32/-30°F) for more than 60 minutes (adjustable on the touchscreen, default: 60 minutes, range: 90 to 360 minutes). the controls send a command to the standby CDU to perform a pump down.

Following the pump down step, the touchscreen will notify the operator to manually close the crossover suction, and liquid isolation valves on the standby CDU only. The operator must perform this function at the end of each pulldown cycle to prevent the risk of refrigerant charge imbalance between each CDU circuit.
Each of the two refrigeration system control panel touchscreens will display which of the two CDUs is running, either CDU1 or CDU2. When an alarm from the refrigeration plant control/starter panel is received, each refrigeration control panel de-activates all outputs except for the drain pan, and drain pipe heaters in the freezing room. Alarms of the standby unit will be ignored (alarms are displayed, but outputs to the room not affected). Each room has a temperature transmitter that transmits the temperature value to the controller of the selected refrigeration system control panel.
A request for cooling occurs when the temperature in the room is at least 1°C above the set point. When at least one room requests cooling, the system control panel sends out a cooling signal to the refrigeration plant. When no rooms are requesting cooling, no cooling signal is sent to the refrigeration plant. The system panel serving the four rooms provides separate signals for full loading (all rooms have cooling demand), and partial loading (some rooms have cooling demand) to the refrigeration plant.
When a request for cooling is identified in a room, the liquid line solenoid valves of that room UCs will open. When the request for cooling is satisfied, the liquid line solenoid valve of the that room UCs will close. When there is no request for cooling in any of the rooms, all room solenoid valves are closed, and no cooling requests are sent to refrigeration plant control/starter panel.
There is a manual option for a forced pump down at the refrigeration plant control/starter panel. When activated, a signal is sent via network from the refrigerant plant control/starter panel to each of the refrigeration system panels to close all room solenoid valves, with cooling demand signals ignored. The duty CDU will go through a normal pump down sequence. Also, there is a manual option for a service pump down at the plant control/starter panel. When activated, all room solenoid valves are forced open. Before initiating a service pump down, the the liquid line isolation valve at the CDU must be manually closed. The compressor is kept running until the refrigerant is pumped down, and stored in the condenser, completing a service pump down. The refrigeration plant control/starter panel sends out a general CDU alarm to the refrigeration system control panel.
Electric Defrost Sequence
Electric defrost is only available in the freezing room. When the system is in ‘Defrost’ mode, the freezing room cooling demand is ignored until the defrost sequence is completed. An authorized user can configure the defrost sequence duration, frequency, override, and stop a defrost sequence if required. Electric defrost takes place every 8 hours (‘Defrost Frequency’ - user adjustable; default 8 hours), or when there is a manual electric defrost made on the touchscreen.
Duration of the defrost should not exceed the manual input on the control screen (‘Defrost Duration’ default = 15 minutes, user adjustable) or when the control panel receives the defrost termination signal, whichever comes first.
The following is the Defrost Sequence.
a) During defrost, the controls closes solenoid valves for the freezing room, and stops freezing room fans.
b) Energize defrost heaters.
c) Waits for the defrost termination fan delay switch (DTFD) to be warm enough to give a defrost termination (DT) signal or ‘Defrost Duration’ (manually adjustable -15 minutes default) to bypass a faulty DTFD switch - whichever comes first.
d) De-energizes the defrost heater.
e) If room has cooling demand, opens solenoid valves. f) Waits 1 minute (user adjustable ‘Fan Delay’).
g) Starts room fan.
Natural Defrost
Natural defrost is available in every room except freezing room. It occurs every 24 hours or when it is manually selected. Duration is manually selected ‘Natural Defrost Duration’ (default=10 minutes, manually adjustable). The sequence is as follows:

3 Capacity step timer ramp down adjustable on screen in factory mode, default 2 minutes, range 0 to 30 minutes
Whenever a capacity step is active, the hot gas bypass valve, and desuperheating valve will mechanically regulate the suction pressure for the ranges of demand between compressor capacity steps. The capacity control allows the CDU to adjust its cooling capacity to any demand.
If the suction pressure exceeds its set point for more than the ‘Capacity step timer ramp up’, the next step of capacity control is engaged. If suction pressure remains below the suction pressure set point for more than the ‘Capacity step timer ramp down’, a step of capacity control is removed. If the current step of capacity is already 33%, then the capacity control initiates a pump down sequence.
Pump Down Sequences
There are three types of pump down sequences:
• Normal pump down.
• Service pump down.
• Standby unit pump down (completion of pull down).
Normal Pump Down
This occurs when the plant control panel is not receiving a cooling signal from the refrigeration system control panel (no load), or when there is a forced shutdown in manual mode. A ‘Normal’ pump down sequence is as follows:
a) Hot gas bypass solenoid valve de-energizes.
b) Desuperheating solenoid valve de-energizes.
c) Waits for LP switch to open:
d) If LP switch opens, the compressor stops, as pumpdown completed.
e) If LP switch has not opened within 3 minutes (Manually adjustable on touchscreen ‘Low pressure switch delay on normal pump down’, default = 3 minutes, range 0 to 15 minutes), stops the compressor, unit goes on alarm ‘Failure to pump down’. An alarm signal is sent to the system control panel via network.

Refrigeration Condensing Unit Switchover
A condensing unit switchover can be manually carried out at the plant control/ starter panel. For a manual switchover, the CDU valves need to be operated manually (manual closing/opening of crossover valves).
Temperature Alarms
The following alarms are displayed on the system touchscreen control panels for each room:
• Low temperature alarm: -5°C (23°F) from setpoint.
Action: Closes solenoid valve on the room with low temperature alarm display.
• High temperature alarm: +5°C (41°F) from setpoint. No action.
Alarm history and trend data is available on the touchscreen. Also, all room temperatures signals are sent to CAMS from each of the refrigeration system control panels.
Blackout and Switchover
Following a blackout, or when a manual CDU switchover is initiated, it must be confirmed on the plant control panel touchscreen that the crossover isolation valves are in the correct position before the CDU is allowed to run. This is necessary to ensure the correct valve positions before the system starts a CDU. The system panels send cooling demand signals to the plant control panel when at least one refrigerated room has a demand for active cooling. The duty CDU compressor then starts. When none of the rooms have call for cooling, the plant performs a normal pump down.
Condensing Unit Start-Up Sequence
Modes Of Operation
Modes of operation are ‘Normal’ mode, one CDU is in operation (duty unit), and the second unit is on standby. In ‘Pulldown’ mode, the control panel allows simultaneous running of two CDUs.
Parameter definitions:
• ‘Low pressure delay on start-up’.
• ‘Disable hot gas bypass on startup’.
• ‘Low pressure (LP) switch delay compressor on’.
a) Condensing unit receives cooling demand from system panels.
b) When the LP switch closes, the start-up sequence begins.
c) If the LP switch closes within ‘Low pressure delay on start-up’, the system starts normally.
d) If the LP switch does not close within ‘Low pressure delay on start-up’, then the unit alarms ‘Low pressure not reset’.
e) Compressor starts with the following :
• Both cylinder unloader solenoid valves energize (33% capacity).
• Both hot gas bypass solenoid valve, and de-superheating solenoid valves de-energized for ‘Disable hot gas bypass on startup’. Following this delay the hot gas bypass system is available for capacity control.
• The LP switch is overriden for ‘Low pressure switch delay compressor on’, and allows the compression ratio to be established. During these 90 seconds, do not perform any capacity control (cylinder loading/unloading).
f) If the LP switch is still open after ‘Low pressure switch delay compressor on’, the unit alarms ‘LPs not reset - post start up‘.
g) If the LP switch closes within ’Low pressure switch delay compressor on’, keep the compressor running based on the running command, and capacity demand.
Compressor Capacity Control
Each CDU compressor has 3 steps of unloading (0%, 33%, 66%). The
also has a hot gas bypass system active at all times when the CDU is running, except during startup, and pump down.
Capacity control is achieved by monitoring the suction pressure, and adjusting the capacity steps in order to maintain it at the desired loading. When the current capacity exceeds the current demand, the suction pressure will have a tendency to lower the demand. This is detected by the controls, and unloads the compressor to match demand. When the current capacity is insufficient to meet the cooling demand, the suction pressure will have a tendency to raise the demand. This is detected by the controls, and loads the compressor to match demand.
Variable Definitions
1 Suction pressure set point = 10.5 psig, dead band, +/-1 psig, default = 10.5 psig adjustable on touchscreen panel in factory mode, range 5 psig to 15 psig. If this setpoint is changed, the setpoint of the mechanical hot gas bypass, and desuperheating valves also need adjustment by a qualified service engineer.
2 Capacity step timer ramp up is adjustable on the touchscreen in factory mode, default 4 minutes, range 1 to 30 minutes.

Service Pump Down
A service pump down occurs when the operator initiates a service pump down at the touchscreen on the plant panel. To initiate a service pump down, the CDU must be running (otherwise options will be hidden). If the duty CDU is off (no call for cooling from system panels), the system will force the CDU to run, and allow the system to stabilize before starting the service pump down sequence.
a) When a service pump down is initiated, a running verification is performed to check that the CDU is running. If the unit is not running, start unit, and allow the system to stabilize.
b) The CDU panel sends a command to the refrigeration system control panels to force all room liquid line solenoid valves to open.
c) The CDU panel de-energizes the ‘King’ solenoid valve, the hot gas bypass solenoid valve, and the desuperheating solenoid valve.
d) Waits for LP switch to open:
• If LP switch opens, the compressor stops, as pumpdown completed.
• If LP switch has not opened within 3 minutes (Manually adjustable on touchscreen ‘Low pressure switch delay on normal pump down’, default = 3 minutes, range 0 to 15 minutes), stops the compressor, unit goes on alarm ‘Failure to pump down’. An alarm signal is sent to the system control panel via network.
a manual switchover of the duty/standby CDU by manually operating the crossover valves, and entering the choice on the touchscreen if the standby CDU is available. If both CDUs have active alarms, the plant stops, and sends an alarm to the system control panels. The alarm condition needs to be investigated, and corrected. The alarms need to be reset at the control panel touchscreen to start the system.
Alarms In Pulldown (Dual CDU Operation) Mode
If one of two CDUs have active alarms, the output to that CDU is disabled, but the system is allowed to run with the active CDU. The plant and system panels displays the alarms. The alarm condition needs to be investigated, and corrected. The alarms need to be reset at the control panel touchscreen to start the stopped compressor. If both CDUs have active alarms, the plant stops, and sends alarm to the system control panels. The alarm condition needs to

High Pressure Switch: This alarm protects the system from a harmful HP condition such as that caused by lack of condenser water flow. This switch stops the compressor. The control panel is informed about the alarm condition. The switch requires a manual reset.
Low Pressure Switch: This alarm protects the system from conditions that lead to LP conditions such as refrigerant leaks. This switch is also used as a control input on certain sequences such as pump down.
Motor Protector Switch: This alarm protects the compressor windings from overheating (overloading). This switch activates an alarm. Also, a discharge gas temperature sensor is installed in compressor cylinder head.
Differential Oil Pressure Switch: This alarm protects the system from insufficient oil flow into the compressor moving parts. This switch stops the compressor, and initiates an alarm. Overloads: The overloads stop the compressor, and initiates an alarm.
E-stop Push Button: When pressed, plant stops, and goes into alarm.
Anti-cycling: Configurable with two choices of modes for each CDU (and can be enabled or disabled as required).
• Anti-cycling: minimum time intervals between starts is configurable between 5 to 30 minutes. Default value = 10 minutes.
• Restart inhibitor: number of starts allowed per hour, and is configurable between 3 to 6 starts. Default value = 6.
The plant control panel has a crankcase heater on/off indication on the touchscreen for each CDU.

7.1 GARBAGE MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL Garbage Compactor
a)
Plastics and Plastics Mixed with Non-Plastic Garbage
Plastic garbage must be retained aboard the ship for discharge at port reception facilities. If incinerated, then the residue, ash and plastic clinkers from plastic incinerated solid waste, should be retained onboard until a suitable shore side facility is available. When plastic garbage is not separated from other garbage, the mixture must be treated as if it were all plastic.
Food Waste
Some governments have regulations for controlling human, plant and animal diseases that may be carried by foreign food waste, and materials that have been associated with them (e.g. food packaging and disposable eating utensils). These regulations may demand incineration, sterilizing, or other special treatment of garbage to destroy possible pest and disease organisms. Such garbage should be kept separate from other refuse and preferable retained for disposal in port in accordance with the laws of the receiving country. Precautions must be taken to ensure that plastics contaminated by food wastes(e.g. plastic food wrappers) are not discharged at sea with other food wastes.
Oily and Contaminated Rags
Oily and contaminated rags, cotton waste, and such like must be kept onboard and discharged to a port reception facility or incinerated. If stored onboard. such material should be kept in a steel container fitted with a secure airtight lid, and stowed away from any hazardous areas.
Other Garbage
Garbage in this category includes, but is not limited to, paper products, rags, glass, metal bottles, crockery, dunnage, lining and packing materials. The vessel may find it desirable to separate dunnage, lining and packing material which will float since this material is subject to a different discharge limit than other garbage in this category. Such garbage should be kept separate from other refuse and preferably retained for subsequent disposal in port.
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
for the amount and type of garbage landed to the shore reception facilities on each occasion garbage is landed. The amount of garbage generated on board is estimated in cubic metres, volume estimates will differ before, and after processing.
Special Areas
These are areas designated under MARPOL 73/78 which have stricter restrictions for the disposal of waste and garbage. A special area is defined in the context of the garbage regulations as a sea area which is recognised for technical reasons in relation to its ocean graphical location, ecological condition and to the type of traffic navigation through this area; the adoption of special mandatory methods for the prevention of marine pollution by garbage is required.
Annex V special areas are: • Mediterranean Sea. • Baltic Sea.
• Black Sea.
• Red Sea.
• Persian Gulf.
• North Sea.
• Antarctic (south of latitude 60° south).
• Wider Caribbean region (including Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea).
• &gt;3nm from the nearest land for comminuted/ground food waste (able to pass through a screen with openings no greater than 25mm).
• &gt;12nm from the nearest land for food waste and cargo residues that are not harmful to the marine environment.
• Cleaning agents which are not harmful to the marine environment (contained in cargo hold, deck and external surfaces wash water).
• Animal carcasses (as far as possible from the nearest land and in accordance with IMO guidelines).
Inside special areas:
• &gt;12nm from the nearest land for comminuted/ground food waste (able to pass through a screen with openings no greater than 25mm).
• &gt;12nm for cargo residues that are not harmful to the marine environment (only if the ship is not transiting outside the special area between ports and no adequate reception facilities are available at those ports).

It is a requirement under MARPOL 73/78 Annex V to have a Garbage Management Plan on board the vessel. The plan will outline the procedures for handling, segregation, storage and subsequent disposal of the ship’s generated garbage. Such a plan is to be clearly exhibited in locations used for the handling of garbage waste, and will also name the person on board responsible for the management of the plan. Warning placards should be in place about the vessel to advise the crew of what measures are in place to restrict garbage disposal into the sea and penalties involved for any breach of the rules.
The collection of garbage generated aboard the ship is based on the considerations of what can, and cannot be discarded overboard while on passage. Where possible and as space allows, receptacles are provided in the most appropriate spaces throughout the ship including the engine rooms, mess room, galley, and other living or working spaces. All crew are to be conscientious when disposing of garbage to maintain the segregation required. Strict use of the system provided will facilitate subsequent shipboard processing and, minimize the amount of garbage which must be retained, and stored aboard the ship for return to port. These receptacles should be clearly marked, and properly distinguishable by colour, graphics, shape, size and location.
Crew responsibilities should be assigned for collecting or emptying these receptacles and taking the garbage to the appropriate processing or storage location. Use of such a system facilitates subsequent shipboard processing and minimizes the amount of garbage which must be stored on board ship for return to port.

Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
The primary combustion chamber is fitted with a charging door to admit solid material, and an ash cleaning door to allow removal of ash and slag when incineration is completed. The cleaning door is interlocked and may only be opened when the incinerator primary combustion chamber temperature is below 100°C. Flue gas from the incinerator is vented via the exhaust ducting/ funnel to the atmosphere. A flue gas damper is mounted in the exhaust ducting above the incinerator. A primary blower provides forced combustion air to the primary combustion chamber, and there are also air inlet nozzles located low down in the primary combustion chamber which supplies combustion air for solid burning.
Control of the incinerator, including the temperature and pressure alarms, is from the PLC unit situated adjacent to the incinerator. A separate control panel for the sludge settling and service tank levels, and temperature alarms and milling pump start mode is also supplied.
The unit is supplied with MGO from the MGO service tank by the incinerator fuel oil pump. This pump supplies MGO under pressure to the burner unit. The sludge burner uses atomising air supplied from the general service air system. Sludge is supplied from the incinerator sludge mixing tank by means of a circulation pump. The sludge dosing pump takes suction from the circulation pump discharge line to supply the incinerator sludge burner. Any excess sludge returns to the sludge mixing tank. The mill pump is for agitation, and homogenization of the contents of the tank. Heating by two electric heating elements to the sludge mixing tank contents prior to burning sludge ensures that there is an even temperature throughout the sludge mixing tank, and that any remaining water is dispersed in the sludge charge.
The incinerator control panel consists of a main START/STOP switch, abnormal alarm indication and a touch screen panel. The touch screen of the PLC displays the temperatures in the combustion chambers and the incinerator operating conditions.
Preparing the Incinerator for Operation
a) Check that there is an electrical supply to the incinerator and that the main control panel is operational.
b) Check that there is a compressed air supply available from the general service air system.
c) Ensure that the MGO pump suction valve from the MGO service tank is open.
d) Ensure that the incinerator sludge mixing tank has been prepared for operation, and has reached a temperature of at least 60°C.
e) Ensure that all valves are in the correct operational position.

Introduction
The incinerator is able to burn solid garbage waste and engine room sludge. MGO is burned in order to raise the combustion chamber to the required temperature for the combustion of solid material and sludge, MGO may also be burned to assist the total combustion when required. Although the unit is capable of burning 920kg of solid waste per hour, and 258kg of sludge per hour, care must be taken to ensure that temperature limits are not exceeded. Problems can arise when burning solid waste if the nature of the waste is not known.
The incinerator is controlled by a PLC unit, utilising a speed control unit to automatically adjust the waste oil feeding capacity. The incinerator is designed with a primary combustion chamber for burning solid material and sludge, a secondary combustion and after-burning chambers for burning uncombusted exhaust gases. The combustion chambers are equipped with MGO burners, called the primary and secondary burner respectively.

f) Check that there are no obstructions for air admission to the primary blower and the flue gas outlet.
g) Ensure that the ash and sluice doors are closed.
h) The incinerator is now ready for operation.
Operating in Sludge Mode
Before starting the incinerator, select ‘SOLID &amp; OIL’ mode on the control panel display.
Step 1 Starting the Incinerator
a) Turn the Start/Stop switch to Start.
b) The primary blower starts, and runs continuously until the incinerator stops (see last step).
c) The air impeller in both primary and secondary burner starts. MGO is circulated through the burners, and back to the MGO tank.
d) Purging for 30 seconds of the primary burner (8M5), and secondary burner (8M3) starts.
e) The hours counter starts, and runs parallel with the primary blower.
Step 2 Preheating
a) After purging of the burners is completed, the secondary burner ignites, and starts burning MGO. This burner starts to heat up all combustion chambers.
Step 3 Start of Combustion
a) At 100°C in the secondary chamber, the primary burner ignites and starts burning MGO.
b) The secondary burner continues to burn.
c) Solid waste bags may be fed into the incinerator at 650 °C in the secondary chamber, ensuring clean incineration. The temperature will now rise faster.
d) At 650°C in the primary chamber, the sludge oil dosing pump will start, and the sludge oil burning starts.
e) At 652°C in the primary chamber, the air damper in the sludge oil burner will open.
When the incinerator is running, both MGO burners will ignite and burn, or shut down, according to the preset temperatures in the combustion chambers. For every restart of a burner, there is a delay of 30 seconds before ignition due to the purging time.

f) At 840°C in the primary chamber, the primary burner shuts down, as the solenoid valve in the MGO supply valve closes.
The flame detectors (35B7, 35B9) give a continuous output to the flame control circuit. In case of flame failure, the alarm will be activated after 1 second, and all oil valves will close, except the quick closing valves. The sludge burner is also controlled via the flame detector (35B7) in the primary chamber.
Step 4 Operation of the Secondary Burner
a) At 930°C in the secondary chamber, the secondary burner shuts down, as the solenoid valve in the MGO supply line closes.
b) If the temperature drops to 870°C, the secondary burner restarts, as the solenoid valve reopens.
Step 5 Stopping Combustion
a) Turn the Start/Stop switch to Stop.
b) The incinerator cooling program starts. This is part of the shutdown process.
c) The solenoid valves in the MGO supply lines for both the primary and secondary burner close.
d) The primary blower and the air impeller in both primary, and secondary burner run continuously.
Step 6 Stopping of Incinerator
a) When the temperature in the primary combustion is below 100°C, the cooling program stops.
b) The primary blower and burner air impellers stop.
All components and functions are now deactivated. However the cooling program may still repeat itself a few times. When it is completed after 4~6 hours, the main switch is turned off to shut down the power supply.

Simultaneous Burning of Solid Waste and Sludge
If simultaneous burning of sludge and solid waste is carried out, the combustion temperature should be set to 850°C on the control panel display. For the operation to give the lowest emissions, burn sludge oil for 1 hour to heat up the incinerator. Before burning sludge oil, select ‘SOLID WASTE &amp; SLUDGE OIL‘ mode on the control panel display.
After 1 hour, change to ‘SOLID WASTE’ mode, and feed in the garbage, and let it burn for one hour. Then change to ‘SOLID WASTE &amp; SLUDGE OIL‘ mode, and burn the rest of the garbage together with sludge oil.
If there are large amounts of both sludge oil and solid waste to be incinerated change the mode every hour, burning sludge oil for 1 hour, then solid waste for 1 hour, and repeat as required.
Adding Solid Waste to the Incinerator
Before adding a new charge of solid waste, look through the sight glass to ensure that the incinerator is ready to receive more waste. Additional solid waste can only be added when the primary combustion chamber has cooled and the temperature interlock on the feeding door has been released. The feeding door is blocked when the primary combustion chamber temperature is above 100°C.
IMO No: 9910313 Produced by: WMT Limited, UK
Empire State Machinery Operating Manual
Care of the Primary Combustion Chamber
• Glass, bottles, and other materials which may not be burned, must not be put into the primary combustion chamber.
• Wet solid waste must not be put into the primary combustion chamber more than one hour before starting the incinerator.
• When burning oil-containing materials, such as filter cartridges, oily cotton waste, and residues from the centrifuges, do not put more than 5 litres per charge into the primary combustion chamber.
• When burning material with high calorific value with explosion- like combustion such as plastic, the maximum charge must not exceed 5.0kg.
• DO NOT overload the incinerator with waste. Ensure a maximum load per charge of 20% of the volume of the primary combustion chamber. The maximum load per charge of class II solid waste must not exceed 100kg/h.
• The feeding door must not be opened unless there is a minimum of 10mm (water gauge) vacuum in the combustion chamber as shown on the U-tube manometer.
• The flue gas uptake damper is set initially and should not be tampered with. However, excess draught can cause erratic combustion and increase the heating-up time. It may be necessary to adjust the flue damper to correct erratic combustion if it is found to be due to the air supply and not to the fuel burner.
• Removal of slag must be undertaken carefully. Do not knock or hammer on the sides of the primary combustion chamber. The main switch must be turned ON to open the door.
Alarms and Trips
The following incinerator conditions trip the incinerator or prevent it from starting and produce an alarm:
• Flue gas temperature sensor failure.
• Primary/secondary chamber temperature sensor failure. • Primary combustion chamber low temperature - 500°C. • Flue gas temperature high - 350°C.
• Primary/secondary chamber high temperature - 1,050°C.

The motor drive shaft is fitted with a dual-circuit external spring operated shoe brake. Two separately acting brake shoes contact the brake drum via preset spring force, the brake force is set to ensure that a fully loaded car can be stopped with one brake shoe operating. The brake is released by electrically operated magnetic clamps.
The elevator is fitted with an electrical supply of 440V at 60Hz from the emergency switchboard 440V section.
The drive motor receives a variable frequency supply from the main inverter, and so varies the car speed. This means the car can accelerate and decelerate smoothly to and from landings according to predetermined speed ramps which are adjustable at the controller.
The control panel is fitted with a system of indicator lamps on its computer board which display system status and any faults which may occur. The elevator car is fitted with a load-sensing control system, this is a weighing device which will sense the loaded condition inside the car. If the elevator is 80% (or higher) loaded, but not overloaded, will bypass any landing calls until it reaches the next car initiated call stop. The unanswered landing calls are stored in the control system memory, and will be attended to in sequence, when the car is next unloaded.
The car cabin is also fitted with a fan, public address loudspeakers, normal and emergency lighting, landing and direction indicators, and a telephone.
There is an alarm pushbutton for use in an emergency. The lift car is fitted with an escape hatch in the roof, opening the hatch will stop the lift and prevent it from moving.
The elevator is fitted with an over-speed governor which will activate the jaw of the safety gear on the car, and counterweight in the event of a descending over-speed. These jaw of safety gear grip the shaft guide rails to prevent further descending movement and must be reset by raising the lift car manually, the jaw of safety gear will then retract automatically.
Elevator Power Loss
The elevator has an electro-mechanical brake which will stop the elevator automatically when the electrical power is cut off. In the event of a failure of the electrical supply, the car is stopped using stored energy. When emergency power is available, the car waits for a signal to move to the nearest landing, where the car doors open.
There is one elevator on board the ship, and is of the single access/egress type. The elevator is powered by electrically-powered traction motor, with a central collective control system.
The speed of travel of the elevator is 45m/minute, and the speed controller controls the acceleration, and deceleration of the car between landings following predetermined, adjustable speed ramps. The lift management system is controlled through a dedicated PC which provides real-time, and historical monitoring of the elevator, which allows access to all programmable functions.
When a landing up or down pushbutton is pressed, the control system determines the direction the passengers wish to travel, and registers this information along with any other previous lift or landing calls. If the lift is already travelling in the up direction it will collect all the up calls in sequence, and the same for the down direction. In this way the elevator does not perform any unnecessary travelling, saving power, and reducing wear on the machinery.
The elevator is powered by an electrically-driven traction machine. The traction machine is an AC synchronous three-phase motor. The synchronous motor contains AC electromagnets on the stator of the motor that create a magnetic field which rotates in time with the oscillations of the line current.
The motor also has an encoder located on the motor shaft which monitors the motor speed, and provides feedback to the main inverter. In an emergency, the drive can be operated by an emergency electrical operation button in the control panel.

            <Title>Absolute Pressure</Title>
            <Text>Air, which is all around you, has weight, and it presses against everything it touches. This pressure is called atmospheric pressure, or air pressure. Atmospheric pressure is the force exerted on a surface by the air above it as gravity pulls it to Earth. Atmospheric pressure is the pressure exerted by the Earth's atmosphere at a given location. Elevation affects atmospheric pressure. For example, standard atmospheric pressure at sea level is approximately 14.7 psia or 101.325 kPa. In Denver, Colorado, atmospheric pressure is 12.4 psia or about 84.0 kPa, and in Death Valley, California it is 14.9 psia or 102.6 kPa. Atmospheric pressure is commonly measured with a barometer.

            <Title>Protective Equipment</Title>
            <Text>The distribution system is fully equipped with monitoring and metering instrumentation to measures electrical parameters like voltage, current, frequency, power factor, and electrical load, and monitors the system for ground faults.  This information helps in managing the electrical system operation and identifying potential issues.
Each distribution branch is protected by multiple circuit breakers that protect the system from overloads, short circuits, and other faults.  The circuit breakers are coordinated so that when a fault occurs, the  circuit breaker closest to the fault trips, interrupting the flow of current to the fault area while minimizing disruption to the remainder of the system.

            <Title>Faraday's Law</Title>
            <Text>Electromagnetic induction was discovered by English scientist Michael Faraday in 1831. It is not an exaggeration to say that this discovery is the foundation of the modern world. 
Faraday observed that a changing magnetic field induces an EMF in a nearby conductor.  You can observe this yourself by moving a magnet around and through a coil of wire connected to a sensitive voltmeter.  When the magnetic field passing through the coil changes, whether by moving the magnet through the coil, by moving the conductor through the field, or by varying the strength of the field, a voltage is induced in the conductor that can be used to drive current and deliver electrical power. 
Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction states that the induced EMF in a closed coil is directly proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux passing through the circuit. Mathematically, it is expressed as: &lt;men xml:id="faradays-law"&gt;\text{EMF} = - n \frac{d\Phi}{dt} &lt;/men&gt; Where: &lt;ul marker=""&gt;
EMF is the induced electromotive force (in volts)
n is the number of turns in the coil
\dfrac{d\Phi}{dt} is the rate of change in magnetic flux (in webers/sec)
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The opposite is also true.  When an electric current flows through a conductor, it generates a magnetic field that surrounds the conductor.  This phenomenon is called Oersted’s principle, and it is principle behind motors, solenoids, and electromagnets.
The experiment setup in &lt;xref ref="fig_faradays_experiment"/&gt; demonstrates both Faraday’s Law and Oersted’s Principle.  
&lt;figure xml:id='fig_faradays_experiment'&gt;
&lt;caption &gt;Faraday’s Experiment&lt;/caption&gt;
&lt;image source="images/Faraday_emf_experiment"  width="75%"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
Two coils are wrapped around opposite sides of an iron ring. The left coil is connected to a battery and a switch.  The right coil is connected to a galvanometer, which is an instrument that detects small voltages.  
When the switch is closed,  current flowing in the left coil produces a magnetic field surrounding the conductor (Oersted’s principle).  This field is trapped and channeled through the right hand coil by the iron ring.  As the field builds up when the switch is closed, or collapses when the switch is opened, a voltage is detected on the galvanometer (Faraday’s Law).  However, If the switch is left in either position for very long, the voltage decays to zero, and remains that way until the switch is once again flipped.  This indicates the the induced voltage is caused by a changing magnetic flux \dfrac{d\Phi}{dt}and not by the flux alone.</Text>

A Column of water 100 ft high exerts what pressure? 
Answer___________________ 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;Column of water one foot high&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image8.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
For columns of water less than one foot, we multiply the height in inches by .036 psi. 
There are 12 inches in 1 foot, therefore \frac{.433psiperfoot}{12inchesperfoot} = .036 psi 
One Inch of Water = .036 psi. 
A column of water 12 inches high exerts what pressure? 
Answer____________________ 
A column of water 6 inches high exerts what pressure? 
Answer___________________ 
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;caption&gt;One Cubic Inch of Fresh Water&lt;/caption&gt;
   &lt;image width="50%" source="images/image9.png"/&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
A column of water 2.31 feet in height gives us a pressure at the base of 1 psi. 

   \frac{1poundofwaterequalswhatverticaldistance?}{1footofwaterexerts.433psi} = \frac{1psiwater}{.433\frac{psi}{foot}/water} =\frac{1psi}{.433psi} = 2.31 feet of water exerts one pound force

            <Title>Distance Conversion</Title>
            <Text>Using unit-factor method we can express a distance in meters from feet as:
To Find distance in meters = (distance in ft) \times (12 in/1 ft) \times (2.54 cm/1 in) \times (1 m/100 cm)
The Conversion factor is .3048 m/ft
distance in meters = (distance in ft) x 0.3048 m/ft
foot = 12”/1 ft \times 2.54 cm/1” = 30.48 cm/ft
foot = 1 M/100 cm \times 30.48 cm = 0.3048 Meters 
Conversion Factor = .3048
meter =1ft/12 in \times 1 in/2.54 cm \times 100 cm/1 m=100 /30.48
meter = 100/30 =3.28 ft
Conversion Factor
foot = 0.3048 m
inch = 2.54 cm
Nautical Miles
Statute Mile= 1 Statute Mile/5280 ft x 6076 ft/1 NM = 1.15 Mile/NM
Conversion Factor = 1.15 mile/NM
km =1.852 NM
The last example explains how to convert meters to inches. We start with the same units as in the first example, but finish with different units. There will be two separate conversions. First, we convert from meters to feet. Then we convert from feet to inches. Remember, there are .

            <Text>	•	HDEC2000 unit provides ten protective functions listed below. 
	•	Generator over voltage
	•	Generator under voltage
	•	Generator over current 
	•	Exciter over current
	•	Loss of filed (under excitation)
	•	Loss of sensing
	•	Loss of power
	•	Diode Fault Monitor for open and short rotating diode status (DFM) Excitation output short circuit protection (hardware support)
	•	Mode mismatch 
The protective functions of HDEC 2000 unit are designed to provide a high degree of reliability and accuracy, but few protective functions are not successful for critical primary protective function (e.g. generator over current) due to measuring range (or saturation problem) of measuring hardware. The reason is described below. 
Internal measuring devices (ex: current sensor) are designed for optimum operation of generator voltage (or excitation current, reactive power ...) regulation because the core function of HDEC2000 unit is regulation. By this reason, we recommend that few protective functions corresponding to this kind are used for secondary protection in conjunction with a primary protective system. 
Normally, a fault event is activated when the generator operating condition exceeds the setting level of each protective function and the operating condition is not returned to normal operating condition within the delay (configured or calculated) time. Each fault event can be indicated on the front panel display and remotely through Com0 or Com2 communication ports. 
When any fault event is activated, internal software fault flag, front panel fault message and output relay (if fault event is assigned for that relay) are latched until the fault event is inactivated and reset command is activated. Additionally, all fault events can be assigned for any output relays (#1 relay to #3 relay).

            <Text>If the gage glass or remote level indicator shows an incorrect level in the DC heater, all sources of inflow and outflow should be immediately investigated and corrected.  Don't simply open up the make-up feed valve when the level is low without first checking the levels in the condenser hotwells and the steam drum.

In some cases, the condensate missing from the DC heater is located in an idle condenser, perhaps due to leakage through a condensate pump discharge valve, or though an open recirc valve.  In this case, the water can be restored to the DC heater by lining up and starting the condensate pump.  However, rapid introduction of cold condensate into the DC heater will cause *quenching*, i.e. the cold condensate will condense the steam in the DC heater and cause a sudden drop in the auxiliary exhaust and DC heater pressures. Quenching may cause the feed pump suction to flash and the feed pump to overspeed and trip.  Therefore, when pumping condensate up to the DC heater, the condensate pump discharge should be throttled and the cold water introduced slowly to avoid problems.  Carefully watch the auxiliary exhaust pressure during this operation.

If the level in the DC heater can not be restored by normal means, consider slowing down to reduce demand or securing the boilers.</Text>

The gerotor mechanism consists of pair of gear shaped elements, one within the other, mounted in a pump chamber, see &lt;xref ref="gerotor_png"/&gt;. The inner gear is directly connected to the drive shaft and the source of power, and drives the outer gear through direct contact. The inner gear has one fewer teeth than the outer gear. The tooth form of each gear is related to that of the other in such a way that each tooth of the inner gear is always in sliding contact with the surface of the outer gear. Each meshing pair of teeth only fully engages at one point, 12 o’clock in the figure above. 
On one side of the point of mesh, pockets of increasing size are formed as the gears rotate (suction pockets), while the pockets on the other side decrease in size (discharge pockets).

            <Text>Do not allow any babbitted bearing to exceed the temperature limits stated previously .  

If a main engine bearing is hot, or its temperature is rising rapidly, bring it down by slowing the main engine.   Find and correct the cause of the problem, then return to normal speed.  Notify the bridge before making speed changes.

A turbogenerator with a hot bearing should be secured until the problem is resolved.

A hot line shaft bearing should be checked for sufficient oil in the sump, and that the slinger ring is rotating. If necessary, the bearing can be cooled by applying cold water to the housing, as well as by slowing down.

If the stated temperature limits are exceeded, the bearing is considered uncontrollably hot and the shaft must be stopped and locked to prevent catastrophic damage. However do not bring the shaft to a complete stop until the oil temperature drops below 180 °F to prevent the bearings from seizing to the shaft. [p. 205][#NavyEOM] After an overheating episode, the bearings and lube oil strainers should be inspected for babbitt particles, and depth gage readings should be taken.  If the readings show no wear, low speed operation can be attempted.</Text>

            <Title>Arc Flash and Arc Blast</Title>
            <Text>Arc flash refers to the release of intense heat, light, and energy that occurs during an electrical fault or short circuit. It is characterized by a sudden and violent discharge of electrical energy through the air. The arc flash generates extremely high temperatures, often exceeding 35,000 degrees Fahrenheit (19,400 degrees Celsius). The intense heat emitted during an arc flash can cause severe burns to anyone in its vicinity. Additionally, the arc flash produces a bright flash of light, which can lead to temporary or permanent vision impairment.
Arc blast, on the other hand, refers to the high-pressure shockwave produced by the rapid expansion of air during an arc flash. The rapid expansion of these vapors creates a blast wave that can cause significant physical damage. Arc blasts can result in powerful pressure waves, similar to those generated by an explosion, which can cause injuries, such as concussions, fractures, hearing loss, and even fatalities. The arc blast can propel debris, molten metal, and hot gases, further exacerbating the risk to individuals in the vicinity.</Text>

            <Text>A plant that is functioning normally is pretty simple to operate &lt;emdash/&gt; as long as the engines have fuel and air the automation does the rest.  But when something goes wrong, the watch engineer needs to assess the situation quickly, and make an appropriate response without delay.  Keeping the lights on and the shaft turning is important, but  the safety of the crew and the vessel is primary.
Although it may not seem like it when you are surrounded by alligators, casualty control can be broken into four phases.</Text>
